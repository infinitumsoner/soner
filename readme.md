# Description

For our analysis, we built custom datasets containing conversation
threads from, different accessibility and general user forums. To ensure
fair comparisons between general forums and accessibility forums, we
restricted the type of threads to include only software-related
discussions, where people focused on various technical and usage issues
associated with an assortment of computer applications. For this
purpose, we mainly considered forums where users were likely to discuss
software-related topics, e.g., JAWS, NV Access, Reddit, Invision
community, and Stack-overflow. All discussion threads were in English.
For each example in the datasets, we captured the thread URL, posts from
every user in the thread, the chronological order of posts, the username
for each post, and the date/time associated with each post. To collect
the threads from the forums, we used the publicly available Web Scraper
tool. All captured data was stored in (csv) files.
