    GeneHiDo you have the NAO  add-on for OCR processing with NVDA?CheersChris  Sent from Mail for WindowsTry nvda r not nvda shift r. I don't recall nvda shift r being for OCR.I'm a bit puzzled by the actual meaning of Cloud pc in this context.
Also are we talking about the Microsoft or that basically is nvda accessing it on Windows?
The new add on recently released works well on things like graphic files with text in them even on lowly Windows 7.

LukeNo, cloud pc, as in shadow, or jumpdesk I think is the other one. A pc in the cloud. I've run one and did run ocr using nvda on there, on the pc.  In the cloud. It worked, but that was in 2020. I have no idea if it would still work, probably as all you are doing is running via launcher and using your keyboare at home to control the machine 300 miles away.Oh... yes, I am using NVDA+R, completely missed the typo in my message. As for screen curtain, yes it is off. NVDA says Recognition failed every time though, and it wouldn't say it if it was on and would instead instruct the user to turn screen curtain off.I'm just trying to figure out what would cause it to fail like this. Maybe I'll grab a portable version and see if it works but I doubt it.When you get this message, have you gone into NVDA to see if
      Screen Curtain is on or off?  It's possible it is changing
      somewhere in the process.  I know that this is an assumption, but
      anything is possible.

"""input gesture dialog"" bug 23 messages","Hi,

      I think I discovered an NVDA bug using the ""input gestures""
      dialog.

      I would like you to confirm this and if so, that one of you
      accustomed to the ticket, make one.

      I consistently reproduce it with NVDA 2022.1 and 2022.2 beta and
      all add-ons disabled.

      To do this:

      - launch nvda with add-ons disabled,

      - display the ""Input gestures"" dialog,

      - press ""end"" to select the last category,

      - go up two categories to select the ""mouse"" category,

      - then ""shift+tab"" to position the cursor in the ""filter"" field,

      - type ""z"".

      

      A series of errors appear in the log.

      Then, each time the ""Input gestures"" dialog is restarted, a new
      error is entered in the log.

      Thank you.

      Best regards.

      Paul.

    -- 

Paul.But do the errors effect NVDA?  It sounds as though the point is to
    provide a command to take an action.  Is the action taken?  I have
    no objection to reporting the error, but if it doesn't affect
    performance in any way, correcting it may not be a good use of
    resources and time.

    

    GeneI don't know why you see the mouse category where you describe it. 
    I have to up arrow something like seven or eight times.  Once I get
    there, if I shift tab once to the filter field and type z, then tab
    once to the list of filtered results, the results are filtered
    properly.  There are many times when errors occur in NVDA that don't
    have any effect on the operation of the screen-reader and in such
    cases, errors are generally not corrected.  

    

    GeneHello!
    

    
    A curious error...
    It only happens at certain categories and with certain letters...
    By instance, in the Mouse category, if I search by ""a"" don't gave
      errors... If I search by ""b"" it gaves the error...
    

    
    And the error is index out of range...
    

    
    The error when you open again the Input gestures dialog is
      because the previous instance was not destroyed because of the
      error...

As I said in previous message, it happens in various sections, not only mouse...

But do not happen with all letters...

Sorry, but for me, all errors should be corrected... Of course priority should go to errors that affect the operations...

But all errors should be corrected!


Rui FontesI suspect this error has been around for a long time.  Does the
    error only occur when you type an individual letter?  It may be a
    bug that doesn't matter.  I generally would expect people to filter
    by a word or group of words and not by  a letter.  .  

    

    GeneGene wrote:

occur in NVDA that don't have any effect on the operation of the screen-reader and in such cases, errors are generally not corrected. Warnings, yes. Errors, not so much.

But this one is an index off by one error. Someone coded it so that it looks up index 4 in a 4 item list that starts at 0. In other words, it has items zero through three, and the code wants the fourth one. It should ask for three, since it counts from zero, but instead it's asking for 4, which doesn't exist.

This is a moderate problem, because as Rui pointed out, the dialog isn't being properly terminated because of the error.

LukeHi.

      When an error is traced in the log, how do you as a user know that
      it does not impact NVDA?

      How can we verify that the result of the filter is correct when
      there is this error?

      It seems to me that an error that does not impact NVDA, is
      reported as a warning.

      Best regards.

    For english language, it's the ""tools"" category.

    I don't think it's up to the user to decide whether this error is
    important or not.

    If developers are logging errors, maybe it matters and probably want
    to know when they happen.

    Otherwise, they log warnings.

    I think it is up to them whether the errors that have been reported
    to them should be corrected or not.

    Le 29/06/2022 14:26, Gene a écrit :Hi all,

As Luke pointed out, this is caused by input gestures dialog trying to show more categories than category results count it has found. You can reproduce this bug across languages (which explains results Paul and Rui were reporting) as follows:


Open input gestures dialog.
Do not select any category (NVDA should select the first category, so leave it at that).
Press Shift+Tab to move to ""filter by"" edit field and type a letter.
Press Tab to move to gestures/categories tree view and record how many categories are showing.
Move back to filter by edit field and clear it (delete whatever letter you wrote).
Move to the tree view and select a category that is positioned one below the number of categories from steps 3 and 4.
Move to filter by edit field and enter the letter from step 3.


Expected: no errors.

Actual: error with IndexError traceback is recorded in the log. You won't hear the error tone if you are using stable version of NVDA.

Cause: see Luke's remark.

Technical (internals): a gestures view model is used by NVDA to show you categories, input help messages, and associated commands. During normal business hours (when no errors occur), you would select the first category, search for gestures, and NVDA will not play error tones. This is because the list of results is greater than 1 unless you type a string of letters and symbols which results in the tree view becoming empty. The IndexError comes not from input gestures dialog per say, but from the gestures view model as the categories count exceeded the position of the tree view you were focused on (NVDA uses GetSelection function from various wxWidgets controls a lot to determine where you are and take appropriate actions as this function returns the position index (0-based)).

For folks wishing to submit a GitHub issue, search for existing issues on input gestures dialog before writing a new issue.

Cheers,
JosephHi all

@Paul,
Why don't you open the ticket yourself? You have all the skills to do it. The technical description that you made of this issue is more than correct with a detailed way to reproduce the issue. And your English, as written in your messages, is also correct.
If something else is blocking you, just let us know and we can help, here or in GitHub once the ticket is opened.

@Gene:
A common consequence of an error occurring in the GUI is that the GUI may not work as expected in the future. For example if you add the following steps to Paul's steps:
- close the input gesture window
- open a new input gesture window
- open a new input gesture window
- open a new input gesture window
- open a new input gesture window
- open a new input gesture window
- open a new input gesture window

You will end up with many input gesture window opened, whereas the standard behaviour of NVDA is to re-focus the input gesture window if it is already opened in the background.

Cheers,

CyrilleThat's interesting.  I wasn't sure if it was causing any problems. 
    When I tried to reproduce it, I couldn't either because I did
    something incorrectly or for some other reason but others have
    reproduced it.

-
Do you notice any difference whatsoever in NVDA (or insert appropriate program here for others) behavior?   If no, that's enough.

I'd love for those getting exercised about this to one day open up virtually any Windows error log you can think of.  There are literally hundreds of errors per day, sometimes per hour, where the world goes merrily along.

If the error is neither fatal, nor deleterious to the user experience, then it's a big meh.  Normal errors do exist.  And we know this in NVDA because every time those inexperienced with the betas start using one there are almost invariably reports here stating, ""I'm hearing the error sound repeatedly.""  Those are almost equally invariably ""normal errors"" that would never be reported to the end user in the production software, even if that very beta is what becomes the production software.

    I took the time because I had it, but I won't do it every day.

    Others will have done it much faster than me.

        ~ Dorothy NevillHi Paul

Yes, if you have investigated the root cause of the issue, that may be valuable to describe it in the ticket, except if the log makes it already obvious.
You may also describe the work-around you have used in your add-on to solve it; it may be a source of inspiration for someone wanting to implement a pull-request to fix the issue. But beware that NVAccess will probably want to fix the root cause of the issue if possible. Thus, if this solution is a workaround that does not solve the root cause, they may not accept it in a PR.

A gentle reminder about topic splitting,"On a group such as this one, that has a public archive, ""keeping a topic together"" so that all information in a given exchange remains united in a single thread/topic is important.  It makes finding the information later in the archive much easier.  It also makes it easier in real time for email participants, because when a new subject line shows up that is actually part of an existing exchange, it can sometimes be difficult to know which exchange and/or the new subject may be ignored.  I want to make clear that this is not about those odd times when, somehow, an accidental change in the subject line for a reply is made before posting.  That happens, and I take care of merging those resulting accidental orphans back into their original topics.

There has been a recent uptick in deliberate topic splitting.  I am asking that folks avoid doing things like correcting spelling in subjects when there are typos, as that splits topics/threads.  Also, if you come up with a solution for a problem that's been under discussion, please do not start a separate topic entitled something like, ""Fixed my issue.""  That splits the fix from the issue that was actually fixed, and if I miss that this has happened later searchers will have no idea of the history of the issue itself or even what it was, in some cases.

If you are someone who wishes to have a subject line revised, please send a message to the owner address, nvda+owner@nvda.groups.io, giving the current subject line and what you'd like to have it changed to instead.  At least that way the topic/thread integrity can be maintained, and notice given that subsequent responses should be done by replying to a message with the updated title/subject.

A problem with the nvda user guide 3 messages,"Hi all,

I am referring to the user guide of nvda 2022.1

There is a table under 5.3. Navigating with the System Caret

When nvda focus onto the table, it says there are 8 rows and 5 columns, but moving around the table, I only find 4 columns.


Am I missing something here?No, you're not missing something, there is a formatting error in that table.

There are actually 5 columns, but the 5th is blank except for a single row (the one for Report Caret Location) and it's very clear that the description column, which currently reads 'none,' somehow accidentally got bumped into that fifth column.  And it's only that single cell in the 5th column, elsewhere, all the rows in column 5 are merged.

A weird case that kills NVDA 5 messages,"Hello all
    

    
    Here is some weirdness that I will try to describe in some
      detail. When this happens, it kills speech from NVDA, but the
      computer is not frozen. If you give the Ctrl+Alt+n command, you
      hear the NVDA startup sound and it comes back. You do not get the
      NVDA shutdown sound. Here is what seems to be the cause and how I
      worked around it:
    

    
    I am using Thunderbird as my email client. The columns in my
      inbox are set up to show attachments first (if any), followed by
      From, followed by Subject. As I have been doing email, every now
      and then I lost all speech and had to restart NVDA, just for it to
      die again when I got to a particular message. I used Narrator to
      figure out what the offending message header was and saw that in
      the From column,it showed ""_Congrat_"" and nothing in the Subject
      column, obviously some spam or malware kind of message. I then set
      up a rule to scan for the string ""-Congrat"" in the From, To, or
      Subject fields and to delete such a message. That seems to have
      worked around the problem.
    

    
    I have no idea why this causes NVDA to go quiet on me, because
      having the offending text string in my message does not have any
      negative effect.
    

    
    Kind regards
    

    
    ChristoI don't know why having the string in that particular place causes a
    problem.  Perhaps there are no spaces and when you write it
    elsewhere, you have spaces before and after it.  What synthesizer
    are you using?  It is most likely that the string causes the
    synthesizer to crash.  If you are curious enough, you can disable
    the rule and look at  a message using a different synthesizer.

    

    GeneI am using the SAPI version of
      Vocalizer, the South African English voice, Tessa. Yes, it is
      quite possible that Tessa is getting choked up, not NVDA as such.
      I'll give your suggestion a go some time.
    

    
    Kind regards
    

    
    ChristoI just read your message and nvda doesn’t die. What synth are you using? I’m using the eloquence from AtGuys.I've noticed in more than one mail client some synths do stop working when you find somebody has made the from or subject line look the same but used some oddball selection of character set which you can often see by looking at the headers of the message.
Sounds like a bug in the synth to me, as most may say junk or go silent on the word but then come back again. I imagine spammers do it to try to get around filters looking for specific strings to identify spam, which is of course what you did, but do be careful, since congrat could be part of a work in a wanted message. Also the person sending such stuff will, I have no doubt find another word to use to get his or her spam though.

ARIA: status role 5 messages,"hello everyone

Does nv-access keeps database regarding the aria-roles compatibility
with the latest version off NVDA?

For example it seems that ARIA: status role is not compatible wait the
latest version of NVDA in Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers. it seems
that this role is only compatible with voiceover on a Mac computers.

Thanks for the link I will keep it…

Try to imagine this situation

a person with disability using a wheelchair comes to a building and he
wants to go in to the building using the ramp

Then he finds that the ramp is not good enough for his wheelchair

then the owner of the building calls out to the required people to fix
this ramp

then the person with that wheelchair comes again and then again tries to
enter the building with no luck

and then again the owner of that building calls to different people to fix
the ramp

how many times do you think a person with a disability can tolerate this
kind of things

this is very similar to the web accessibility issues

it is OK too test over and over  with
screen readers in different browsers and operating systems - - but in my
opinion there should be  stable database
regarding the compatibility for screen reader users

In some cases it's not that simple to make changes to the code over and
over again - this also can be time-consuming and cost sometimes a lot of money

Accessible Youtube video downloader? 8 messages,"Hey guys,Any suggestion for Youtube video downloading program that is accessible with NVDA and still in active development?

Because of this, I'm thinking of finding a replacement, but I'm not aware of any programs out there that is accessible with NVDA and still in active development.Hi.

    You can use 4k Video Downloader for Playlists or Songr for single

Accessing My TeamViewer ID and Password With NVDA 9 messages,"Hello,
 
If an individual wants to see my screen using TeamViewer, I must give him my TeamViewer ID and password.  The ID and Password for each session is displayed when I begin a TeamViewer session.  How do you read the TeamViewer and password

Any help would be appreciated.

Phone: 713-444-7838
E-mail: ljmaher03@...Louis,
Unfortunately, there has been an accessibility regression in later versions of TeamViewer which makes reading the partner ID and password difficult.
First, if the tab key is silent try pressing the escape key and then see if the tab key navigates from one field to the next.
Even if it does the problem is that the cursor no longer allows you to read the characters in the partner ID or password fields. It will speak them, however, so you could use NVDA’s speech viewer to review them. Just enable it first from
 within the Tools menu of NVDA, get Teamviewer to speak the ID and password and then go into the speech viewer window to review the info. However, users need to reach out to Teamviewer to alert them of this problem.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgIt’s broken right now.  I just point my camera and the aira agent takes a picture,  NVDA will not see the text however.Hi David, 
 
Unfortunately, in NVDA, even after hitting the escape key, I could not get the tab key to say the ID and Password. 

 
What will work is to go into JAWS, and tab from field to field there, then use the JAWS history function to get the ID and Password, copy them to a text file, unload JAWS  and load NVDA and then work with that.
 
Thanks.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgI have sent Teamviewer some tweets about this using the handle @teamviewersupport. Anyone else who is experiencing similar frustrations should do the same or at least use whatever other support channels are available to let them know about
 the problems. If I’m the only person reaching out to them nothing might happen. Strength in numbers may be what is needed here.

Could it be that they were alerted early of the change, though it does seem a bit daft and one also wonders if it works with Narrator. I don't have the windows 10 machine at hand to test this, but my Jaws is 2018, since I hardly use it as Nvda inmost other seems more responsive.

I'm tidying up my addons and realized I still have the ifInterpreter version 1.3 which is incompatible by now. After googling it, I know that it has been updated, but I couldn't find any link to an actual version. Can anybody tell me where I can find it?

best wishes, GuenniIf it's been updated, it doesn't seem that the developer has propagated that out. 

From the NVDA Add-Ons Directory (hosted by the Spanish-Speaking NVDA Community Association):  




Automatic speech output for interactive fiction interpreters (IF Interpreters)

1.3 (stable)
From NVDA 2017.3 up to 2019.3
IF Interpreters 1.3 (stable)



The developer's page shows 1.3 as the latest release.  I have no idea if this add-on falls into the category where doing nothing more than a manifest update would make it compatible with more recent versions or not.  I would contact the developer directly regarding whether an update is to be issued or not.

Are you now the official maintainer?  If so, then you should request the updates to the  NVDA Add-Ons Directory site for this add on in terms of compatibility.

If not, then noting you've created a version that's unofficial that is compatible with 2022.1, and how you did that, is something you should do here.

Add-on Updater and Windows Ap Essentials 22.08 2 messages,"Hello NVDA community,After weeks of hard work, I’m delighted to announce the immediate release of Add-on Updater and Windows App Essentials 22.08. Add-on Updater 22.08 is a major update, while Windows App Essentials 22.08 is a minor release filled with bug fixes. For now you must download these releases manually (I have queued these add-ons for distribution on community add-ons website):Add-on Updater: https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.08/addonUpdater-22.08.nvda-addonWindows App Essentials: https://github.com/josephsl/wintenApps/releases/download/22.08/wintenApps-22.08.nvda-addon Key highlights:Add-on Updater: this add-on has gone through a significant rewrite. In particular, the assumptions from the past four years have been revised, reimagined, and refined. Three changes are notable: first, you can now ask NVDA to check for, download, and update add-ons in the background provided that: you are using Windows 10 or later, NVDA is actually installed, and update notification is set to toast (default). This will be a welcome change for people working on tasks and do not wish to be interrupted with a dialog telling you that NVDA add-ons are available – you will see toasts instead. In relation to this, the menu item you will see after checking for updates is now called “review add-on updates”, and as a bonus, NVDA will tell you exactly how many add-on updates are available. Second, if you have one or more add-ons disabled, Add-on Updater will no longer update them automatically, or if add-on updates list is showing, disabled add-ons will not be checked by default. This is because in recent NVDA releases, updating disabled add-ons will actually enable them after NVDA restarts. Third, you can now check for add-on updates from multiple sources (internally called “protocols”). This is perhaps the most significant change to Add-on Updater in years – previously Add-on Updater checked for updates for add-ons registered on community add-ons website (addons.nvda-project.org). Starting from version 22.08, you can ask Add-on Updater to check for add-ons registered on Spanish NVDA community website in addition to the international add-ons website, and you can choose which sources to obtain updates from. As always, the default source is the international website, but for folks using add-ons from other sources, this will be a welcome change (a special thank you to members of the Spanish NVDA community for keeping their add-ons website up to date and for giving me guidance on implementing this change; this change does not replace Tienda add-on). There are other changes under the hood, including removing what I hope to be the last remnants of Python 2 from 2018.Windows App Essentials: version 22.08 is filled with refinements and bug fixes. Notably, changes were made to support more Windows 11 Version 22H2 (preview) features and changes. For Solitaire Collection fans, version 4.13 of this game improves accessibility, notably card suits and ranks are announced thanks to information coming from the game itself. As a result, future versions of Windows app Essentials will remove workarounds for Solitaire Collection (later this year). IMPORTANT NOTES:These will be the last add-on releases (from me) to support NVDA 2021.3. From September 2022 releases, Add-on Updater and Windows App Essentials will require newer NVDA releases (Add-on Updater = 2022.2, Windows App Essentials = 2022.1). In late August, Add-on Updater will not offer updates for folks running 2021.3, so I advise updating to newer NVDA releases as soon as possible (ideally yes if add-ons are compatible).Add-on Updater: version 22.08 does not replace Tienda from Spanish community. Also, if you do switch add-on update sources, you will be asked to confirm if you wish to do so.Windows App Essentials: version 22.08 will be the last version to support Windows 10 Version 21H1 (May 2021 Update/build 19043). Starting from September, Windows 21H2 releases will be required (Windows 10/build 19044/November 2021 Update, Windows Server 2022/build 20348, Windows 11/original release/build 22000). If you are indeed running Windows 10 May 2021 Update, PLEASE UPGRADE ASAP to the latest Windows 10 or 11 release as Microsoft will end support for May 2021 Update this December. Enjoy the new add-on releases.Cheers,JosephHi all,

Update: Add-on Updater and Windows App Essentials are now being deployed via Add-on Updater.

The answer to this question is, ""Yes.""

I would ask all members who have questions about the compatibility of any NVDA Add-On with a specific version of NVDA to consult the NVDA Community Add-Ons Site
and/or the NVDA Add-Ons Directory (hosted by the Spanish-Speaking NVDA Community Association) since both routinely have compatibility information listed for each and every add-on.

        ~ Dorothy NevillAwesome! Thanks for these tips for future. So I'll go ahead and update these 2 then.

GeraEnviado desde mi iPhone SE (2nd Generation) de TelcelHi,

Yes but not for long. The just released add-on updates will be one of the last releases to be compatible with NVDA 2021.3.x. End of compatibility with 2021.3.x depends on when 2022.2 is released, and I will give you at least 30 days notice before asking you to upgrade NVDA.

Cheers,

JosephA weird one for you, unfortunately it only happened after the update to .07. For some odd reason it put the  computer in editors, toggled so insert was in over write. I could not toggle it back the other way, so had to reboot the computer, and then its seemed fine again.

Add-on Updater notice: introducing Project Meteor to refactor add-on download and installation steps 13 messages,"Hi all,
Have a safe and healthy Independence Day (to folks in United States celebrating it).
The following will affect everyone using Add-on Updater add-on at some point as it amounts to rewriting significant parts of this add-on:
Of all the add-ons I have published so far, Add-on Updater is very special. Not only it is a proof of concept for an NVDA feature request, it is a necessary tool to keep add-ons up to date. While I treat Windows App Essentials with care, I take pride in seeing Add-on Updater used by thousands of users around the world.
This year marks the fourth anniversary of Add-on Updater. Released in August 2018, Add-on Updater’s core mission is to check for, download, and install add-on updates. In the course of bringing this to life, I have borrowed heavily from NVDA screen reader itself, as evidenced by ad-on download progress dialog which resembles the experience you go through when checking for NVDA updates. This is intentional as Add-on Updater was born out of a need to give the NVDA community two things: a tool to keep add-ons up to date, and a way to test NVDA issue 3208 in the form of an add-on (as folks pointed out recently, some add-on features do end up becoming part of NVDA, the most notable being screen curtain feature).
But as Add-on Updater became popular, the design decisions made in 2018 became roadblocks to adding more exciting features and increased maintenance burden. For example, due to the way add-on download facility is written, it is impossible to test the actual download internals without editing the associated progress dialog. This is more so when updating multiple add-ons, commonly seen when authors release add-ons compatible with latest NVDA release. Same goes with the actual ad-on update progress interface – it is impossible to test just the internals of add-on update mechanism without doing something to update progress dialog. More importantly, because of the way update check mechanism is structured inside the add-on, it is impossible to let Add-on Updater users obtain updates not hosted on community add-ons website, nor is prepared to handle different ways to obtain updates from community add-ons website (not here; ask add-ons list please ).
Enter Project Meteor, an effort to fundamentally restructure Add-on Updater internals. The core features of the ad-on will not change (Add-on Updater will still check for, download, and update add-ons). At a high level, Project Meteor will separate download and installation routines from the accompanying graphical user interface; in other words, it will become possible to check for, download, and update add-ons in the background without having to open NVDA menu/Tools/Check for add-on updates dialog, useful if you just want NVDA to update add-ons in the background and prompt you to restart. In addition, Project Meteor will lay the foundation for a feature some of us may have only dreamed about: accessing other add-on update sources from Add-on Updater (in order to fully realize this feature, NVDA 2022.1 or later is a must, will explain why later), which may take a while to implement. Most importantly, with Project Meteor, it will become possible to test internal add-on update routines without having to edit the associated user interface code.
The good news is that users of Add-on Updater 22.07 are already using parts of Project Meteor. Bug fixes from Add-on Updater 22.07 such as centering add-on download progress dialog were implemented while planning Project Meteor. But the latest Add-on Updater release (22.07) does not contain the core Project Meteor work – that’s coming later and parts of it are now available in the form of a try build (see below). As of time of this post, Project Meteor core is complete – add-on download and installation routines are now truly separated from progress dialogs. The foundation for checking add-on updates from different sources is ongoing.
For people wishing to test Project Meteor and provide feedback can do so with the following try build:
https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.07/addonUpdater-tryProjectMeteor20220704.nvda-addon
 
IMPORTANT NOTES:

This is work in progress. Try builds are not stable add-on versions and should not be used in production environments! Please do provide feedback if you have suggestions/bugs/concerns/other comments (private message please).
Before installing the linked try build, tell NVDA to not update Add-on Updater (NVDA menu/Preferences/Settings, Add-on Updater, check “Add-on Updater” from “do not update add-ons” list). This is because Add-on Updater will try to “upgrade” to 22.07 when in fact this is a downgrade.
When you check for add-on updates, you will notice two things: the name of the dialog will be called “Project Meteor add-on update check”, and add-on updates list will report installed add-on versions as “0.0”. These are intentional – dialog title will let you know that you are testing a try build, and the strange version text is for compatibility with other parts of Add-on Updater. I plan to resolve these in a future try build once Project Meteor user interface matures.
When downloading and installing updates (particularly when updating multiple add-ons), you will notice that instead of showing download and update progress dialogs after downloading each add-on, NVDA will show you an overall download progress dialog followed by an update dialog while installing ALL add-ons at once. This is perhaps the biggest thing you will notice in Project Meteor and is an evidence of separation of add-on download and install internals from the user interface; indeed this is the first goal of Project Meteor, and I’m happy to share the progress made so far.
Speaking of downloading add-on updates, you will hear beeps similar to progress bar output. Due to the way add-on download routine works, it is impossible to show you progress bar output for individual add-on downloads – the new download dialog shows you the overall progress of add-on downloads. To compensate for it, progress beeps will be heard while individual add-ons are downloading.
Add-on download and install interface changes will apply even if NVDA presents a toast message (Windows 10 and 11) about add-on updates.
When installing add-on updates, NVDA may not present an error dialog even if NVDA finds errors during installation (among these are compatibility error). I will add the appropriate interface for it in a future try build.

Folks reading the add-on source code will notice additional things, including a new Python module. See Project Meteor notices on NVDA Add-ons list (archive) for details on what they are.



 
I expect to release a few more try builds to showcase Project Meteor progress and to incorporate your feedback. If things go well, Project Meteor will be part of add-on Updater 22.08 (which might be the last version compatible with NVDA 2021.3).
 
Thanks.
Cheers,
JosephHi all,

A major bug was discovered with July 4th try build resulting in inability to download add-on updates under some circumstances. This is now resolved in July 5th try build:
https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.07/addonUpdater-tryProjectMeteor20220705.nvda-addon

Cheers,

JosephHi all,

I'm delighted to announce the immediate release of two try builds with fixes and a feature folks have only dreamed of:


First try build: https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.07/addonUpdater-tryProjectMeteor20220708.nvda-addon
Second try build: https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.07/addonUpdater-tryProjectMeteorNVDAEs20220708.nvda-addon


These builds are identical apart from one major thing: where add-on update records are coming from. Yes, you read it right: if you are using the second try build, Add-on Updater will gather update information from Spanish community add-ons catalog, sometimes known as nvda-addons.org. While Add-on Updater will default to using community add-ons website (first try build), it is now possible to obtain add-on update data from other sources through a concept called ""update check protocol"" - a collection of tasks Add-on Updater can perform to check for updates from a variety of places. The reason for these two try builds is to test this feature thoroughly with different sources and because there is no setting in Add-on Updater settings panel to configure which source Add-on Updater should use. I do plan to add such an interface soon. Also, if you are using NVDA 2022.1 or later, you will be able to specify which source to use from the command line (coming soon).

Please remember that try builds are not really meant for production environments, but I'm giving you permission to test today's builds in stable environments for testing purposes. I hope to release a stable version of Add-on Updater with these exciting changes in August at the earliest.

Cheers,

JosephThis is awesome! I'm wondering though if there's going to be a way to
just have it pull from all sources to check? Or is that too much?Hi,

In theory, yes. There are several downsides, however:


Varying update metadata formats: different add-on update sources return update metadata in different formats. For example, the metadata format used by Spanish community catalog is different than that of community add-ons website. At least this is mitigated by telling Add-on Updater to standardize around a common format independent of any source and telling update check protocols to return things in a standard way.
Latency: because websites are hosted around the world, it takes time for NVDA (specifically, Python) to connect to different sources and obtain what it needs. NVDA will actually appear to freeze when opening websites using Python, which is not the experience users want; fortunately, developers wrote workarounds such as using multiple threads to keep NVDA responsive even when a connection is being made to a remote location.
Code complexity: although I do my best to write clean code as much as possible, when dealing with things such as accessing multiple locations at once, it becomes important to think about how complex this task can become. Indeed, coordinating multiple threads (one thread per add-on source) can introduce unforeseen bugs such as freezes and unresponsive user interface.
Metadata conflicts: suppose you connect to two add-on sources at once, and both sources return information for the same add-on. One source says whatever version you have is the latest, while the second source may offer a newer version but incompatible with whatever NVDA version you have. Now you connect to a third source, which offers an older version of the same add-on which is compatible with the version of NVDA you have. For humans, the answer is to stay on the current version, but for computers, it becomes a question of which strategies they can learn from programmers. This is made complicated when we throw in compatibility information to the mix.
Future of add-ons repositories: without going deep into details, NV Access is researching (or did research) a way to host add-on metadata in a central location. Once that becomes a thing, the add-ons community will be advising folks to submit to the new central database.


Hope this explains a lot.

Cheers,

JosephHi all,

I'm delighted to announce the immediate release of Add-on Updater July 11th try build:
https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.07/addonUpdater-tryProjectMeteor20220711.nvda-addon

This try build packs many goodies, including two new Add-on Updater settings and features some of you have only dreamed of. With this build, Project Meteor is complete - all I need to do is refine it based on feedback (speaking of feedback, feel free to use this try build in production environments; note that this is not a stable build yet).

Changes:


Various internal code changes.
Update add-ons in the background: yes, you read it right. If you are using Windows 10 and 11, you can now ask Add-on Updater to check for, download, and install add-on updates all on its own (in the background). A new checkbox named ""Update add-ons in the background"" is available to configure this feature. If you are an iPhone or Android phone user, this is similar to automatic app updates. Note that not all add-ons are optimized for it - some add-ons will present an installation dialog when updating them, and I have asked other add-on authors about what to do. The other change is that when you do review add-on updates, a simple list view will be presented instead of a list of checkboxes to tell you that add-ons were updated, and when you close add-on updates dialog, you will be prompted to restart NVDA. In case you are wondering if NVDA will tell you about automatic updates, yes it will via toast notifications.
Update source: building from July 8th try build, a new combo box named ""Add-on update source"" was added to Add-on Updater settings panel to let you select which source Add-on Updater should use when fetching add-on update information (I'm using Spanish community add-ons catalog to test this feature). For most users, community add-ons website (default source) should be sufficient unless you are using add-ons not listed there; the add-ons community members do welcome new add-ons to international community add-ons website hosted by NV Access and the NVDA community.


I expect to release one last try build in Project Meteor series later this week with bug fixes and refinements based on community feedback. If things go well, all the features I have described in this thread will become part of Add-on Updater 22.08.

Thanks.

Cheers,

JosephHi all,

Add-on Updater Project Meteor July 12th build is now available:
https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.07/addonUpdater-tryProjectMeteor20220712.nvda-addon

I expect this will be the second to last try build in Project Meteor series. This try build includes four changes - two are visible, two I won't talk about on this forum (if you are curious, contact me privately please).

Changes:


Command-line options: Add-on Updater can now take in additional command-line options if available. This feature requires an installed copy of NVDA 2022.1 or later. In fact, in order to take advantage of this feature and other updates, an upcoming release of Add-on Updater (scheduled for later this year) will require NVDA 2022.2 or later.
Switching add-on update sources: if you do decide to change add-on update sources from Add-on Updater settings panel, NVDA will ask if you really wish to do it. If you say ""yes"", the new source will be used, otherwise the old source will be used. Note that if you say ""no"", Add-on Updater settings panel will not reopen (this is actually a bug in NVDA).
Experimental features: shhh, not here.


IMPORTANT: if you do install this try build and happen to tell Add-on Updater to check for Add-on Updater updates, you will be asked to ""upgrade"" (actually downgrade) to 22.07. I plan to fix this in the next (and final) try build (later this week).

Cheers,

JsephHi all,

I'm delighted to announce the last try build in Project Meteor series:
https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.07/addonUpdater-tryProjectMeteor20220714.nvda-addon

This build includes mostly bug fixes. Please review the changelog and notes before installing this try build.

Changelog:


Updated translations for some languages.
Internal code tweaks.
NVDA will no longer present add-on update toast messages if no updates are available (traced to a logic error).
Refinements to restart NVDA dialog.
On Windows Server 2008 R2/2012/2012 R2/2016/2019/2022 systems, NVDA will no longer enable automatic add-on update checks; you must now check for add-on updates manually on server systems. Consequently, automatic add-on update check checkbox is removed from Add-on Updater settings panel if running on Windows Server.
The ability to configure add-on update notification (dialog or toast) and background updates is now restricted to Windows 10 and later provided that NVDA is actually installed (not a portable copy) due to technical limitations. This also fixes an issue where if using portable copy of NVDA, you may find that NVDA tools menu will say ""review add-on updates"" without explanation.
You can now enable update checks for Add-on Updater. Note that until the next stable version of Add-on Updater is released, no updates will be shown.


Additional notes:


Although this is a try build, do try using it on production environments and provide feedback so I can refine the add-on.
Regarding disabling automatic add-on update checks, this change applies to Windows Server systems for now. This change will apply to Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 in January 2023. Manual update checks will remain as part of ""nightlight mode"" I mentioned in June; there is a second part of nightlight mode which will require some work to implement: disabling updating to development releases on older Windows releases altogether. I plan to not restrict users of older Windows releases from seeking updates from different sources. As I mentioned last month, I advise folks to upgrade to supported Windows releases now (ideal), as soon as possible (strongly recommended), or before January 2023 (last resort). I will talk more about nightlight mode in an upcoming post.


Cheers,

JosephHi all,

Major change to nightlight plan: after reading feedback from the community, I decided to scrap a major part of nightlight mode: on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, Add-on Updater will not touch automatic update check setting. Proceeding with the original plan can create confusion for users and does not align with precedence. An updated try build is now available to apply this change:
https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.07/addonUpdater-tryProjectMeteor20220714A.nvda-addon

Cheers,

JosephHi all,

A significant change is now being tested in Project Meteor in the form of a new try build:
https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.07/addonUpdater-tryProjectMeteor20220715.nvda-addon

The biggest change (to be included in upcoming Add-on Updater stable release) is that disabled add-ons will not be updated by default. Depending on background add-on updates setting:


Background updates on: NVDA will just ignore disabled add-ons altogether.
Background updates off: disabled add-ons will be unchecked in add-on updates dialog (the one you get after checking for add-on updates). If you somehow check disabled add-ons and select ""update add-ons,"" NVDA will ask if you wish to update disabled add-ons as updating them will enable them after restarting NVDA. If you say ""no"", NVDA will return you to ad-on updates dialog where you can uncheck disabled add-ons.


Cheers,

JosephWell I'd like a feature where you can choose to update addons
      from either the nvda addon database or thee author spaciffic
      addons.
    Or find a way for something to automatically pole updated
      releases pages for authors periodically to get updates.
    Some updates like tony's addons have not got latest updates to
      1.14 and while you can request them manually added to the addon
      files database surely we need more sources.
    Now I realise the potential for misuse but there are somethings
      that are not even in the main database.
    Some others have made other sources and tools but there really
      should be other ways to select other databases and other mirrors
      and users.
    I mean they do it in linux several sources at once.
    

    
    Not sure how security would work though.Hi,

As I wrote to Clement a while back, this can cause confusion for both users and Ad-on Updater regarding version and compatibility conflicts.

Cheers,

Add-on suggestion - tone control/EQ for audio output 4 messages,"Hi.
    I'm not a developer so I'm throwing this idea out there in case
      anyone fancies making it.
    I think it'd be awesome to have a tone control or an EQ for
      NVDA's audio output. An example of why this would be useful would
      be if you have your computer connected to a decent pair of
      speakers or a hi-fi and the TTS engine you're using has way too
      much bass. With this add-on you could easily fix this by removing
      the low frequencies, and because it would be  NVDA specific, your
      music or whatever you're listening to wouldn't be effected. I
      personally get around this problem by using 2 sound cards, but
      that isn't always an option particularly over headphones. 

    
    It could also work the other way by carving out the high
      frequencies if you have a speech synth that's too sibilant.
    I could see this working in 2 ways. Either as a tone control, So
      50% would be neutral, with values higher than that affecting the
      low frequencies and lower values the high frequencies. Or you
      could have a graphic EQ so you could boost or cut specific bands
      to taste like on a hi-fi. You could even offer both and allow the
      user to switch between each mode.
    I'm pretty sure there's open source filters and EQs you could
      incorporate into the add-on so you wouldn't have to make
      everything from scratch. It wouldn't even have to be the best
      thing out there, just something good enough for the job.

    
    Obviously it should not introduce any latency.

    
    Feel free to forward this to the add-ons list.
    I said at the top it could be an add-on but having it as standard
      would be even better.

    
    I'm interested to see what you all think.

    
    

    
    All the best,
    KaraYou would need separate adjustments for base and treble.  Having
    higher values affecting bass and lower values the treble in the same
    control might be confusing and would limit options.  What if you
    want to control both?  

    

    GeneThis would need to be simple, for the non-audio folks. So, how about a simple Baxandall??That’s nothing more than the bass and treble controls found on millions of car and home hi-fi stereos.Yes, that's one of the things I had in mind. I suggested the
      graphic EQ option for E.G. if someone had difficulty hearing
      certain frequencies and they could then boost if required. Saying
      that though, I  expect adjustments lie that would probably be done
      globally anyway. So just a simple tone control would probably be
      best.",427,7,0.016393443,0.016393443,1,426,23.58,23.85,13.22,33.33,17.04,17.37,84.98,71.6,59.62,13.38,6.1,2.58,0,3.29,0,0.23,7.28,14.55,7.75,1.17,11.03,14.08,6.81,8.92,1.64,19.48,7.51,3.29,3.05,0,1.41,1.64,23,1.17,21.6,1.64,4.23,6.1,5.63,0.23,6.34,0,2.82,1.88,0.94,0.7,0.47,0.23,0,0,0,0,6.81,2.35,0,0.23,0,0.47,1.17,4.23,0.23,0,0,0,0.7,0,0,0.7,2.11,0.94,0.23,0.94,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,1.64,0.23,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,0,0.23,7.98,11.03,0.23,0,7.28,0.94,1.88,0.47,0.23,1.41,2.82,1.41,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,15.49,6.34,2.58,0.7,0,3.76,2.11
Add-on update notice: fixed Add-on Updater offering incompatible add-ons 12 messages,"Hi all,Recently a number of add-ons were updated that require NVDA 2022.1, and these were approved for distribution on community add-ons website around 7:52 PM Pacific (UTC-7) on May 15, 2022. Around 1:11 AM on May 16th, I received a report from the add-ons list about compatibility messages with NVDA 2021.3.5 (the latest stable version as of time of this writing) and confirm that Add-on Updater was offering incompatible add-on updates to users. I have stopped Add-on Updater from offering add-on updates requiring NVDA 2022.1 around 1:36 AM Pacific.While the update issue is resolved, I decided to inform you of what happened as Add-on Updater is my responsibility, and the described issue was part of a chain of events that led to folks experiencing confusion for a while. My sincerest apologies for this mishap.P.S. A bigger factor: mental exhaustion due to me being a workaholic when it comes to everything NVDA. The events that led to the mishap described cannot be explained fully here, but what I can say is that as soon as graduate final exam is done this week and Windows App Essentials 22.06 is released next week, I’ll be looking for a great distraction from NVDA before I crash with mental exhaustion. This can partly explain why I’m not my usual self these days.Cheers,JosephWe appreciate all the work you do. You definitely deserve a long disconnected vacation. JanetYou know you really need to get someone else to manage the load

Amen to both of those sentiments, Janet!

I've been telling Joseph for some time now that he needs to stop talking about ceasing involvement with NVDA development and actually cease it.  And that's not because there is not an immense well of respect for him and all the work he has done.  No one is obligated to sacrifice their entire lives even to projects about which they are enthusiastic and devoted.  Passing the torch is a natural thing.

Joseph, best of luck getting through finals.  My last round of dealing with that was in the late 1990s when I was in a graduate program where I took all 4 years of undergraduate core courses in the first year and then entered into the usual graduate curriculum for the following two years.  Grad school is exhausting.

     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedAs an asside I have reinstalled 14.7 and rechecked and yeah no
      longer getting stuff that will not work with my version anymore.Hi,

What is for certain is that I'm definitely devoting June to something other than writing Python (for once in quite some time). As far as NVDA code contribution goes, I submitted what might be my last pull request last week (a possible solution to let mouse and touch users navigate and interact with Windows 11 UI elements on screen). I'm half-tempted to flat out ask NV Access to take Add-on Updater and Windows App Essentials under their wings so I can (finally) cleanly depart this project (for now).

The workload I'm involved (or thought about) are:


Add-on authorship and maintenance
Reviewing add-ons from the community
Look for Windows 10/11/Insider Preview accessibility and usability issues for screen reader users
Carefully guide the community toward long-term goals, or for that matter, slowly prepare the community for post-NVDA era (yes, that's slowly coming). While I cannot go into specifics, I imagine a day when academic researchers will ""unearth"" NVDA source code and try to figure out what's going on (the process for preparing for such a scenario isn't trivial, requiring changing the mindset of contributors, and to some degree, add-ons community; won't go into details now but perhaps find a time to talk about it soon).


Hope this helps.

If you have Add-on Updater 22.03.1, then you have the latest Add-on Updater installed.

I get a hunch that you are talking about a different add-on - perhaps Windows App Essentials? If yes, the latest version of that add-on is 22.05. If you are using an older release and Add-on Updater is not offering newer releases, chances are that Add-on Updater is told to not check for updates to add-ons (NVDA menu/Preferences/Settings, Add-on Updater, review ""do not update add-ons"" list). Both Add-o Updater and Windows App Essentials support Windows 10 Version 21H2 and NVDA 2022.1.

By now, we should all ""know this is coming"" when NVDA has a backward compatibility breaking release.  And, so far the convention for these seems to be the dot one release for a given major release number (the year of release).


From Joseph Lee, in regard to checking the current Add-On compatibility with current NVDA Release status:  As always, keep track of compatibility status of your favorite add-ons from the following link: Add-ons and backwards incompatible NVDA releases (nvda-project.org)
 
Download Sources for Most Add-Ons (some home-grown ones will appear in neither location):
NVDA Add-Ons Directory (hosted by the Spanish-Speaking NVDA Community Association)
NVDA Community Add-Ons Site

There will be occasions where, if no one is maintaining a given add-on, it may never become compatible with the latest NVDA release.  Add-On developers are those who maintain add-on code, not NVAccess, so if someone walks away from maintaining an add-on, and that role is not picked up by someone else, the add-on dies.

Adobe Acrobat reader & NVDA 34 messages,"I have a question regarding NVDA & readability/accessibility of Adobe
acrobat documents. I'm using:
adobe Acrobat DC version 22.1.20169.0
Microsoft Windows 10 Version 21H2 (OS Build 19044.1826)

I also have a program called QRead on my system which opens .pdf
files. I'm going to paste 2 identical samples of a document, 1
generated via the combination of NVDA & Adobe Acrobat DC & the other
generated using QRead & NVDA, respectively.

I'd like to know why such significant differences exist, & what, if
anything, can be done, because clearly the 1st rendering is truly
unacceptable.

& check out my sites at www.brightstarsweb.com & www.mysitesbeenhacked.comThis isn't an NVDA problem.  This is an illustration of why people need more than one program in many cases.  One program recognizes the spaces in this case and another doesn't.  In another document, the opposite may be the case, Acrobat may render it better.

My guess is that a nonstandard code is used for spaces in the document.  My guess is that it has some sort of visual appeal.

GeneGene, you know what? I think it is. Screenreaders routinely alter the
appearance of documents to make them more usable, (think virtual
buffer for webpages). Adobe, like it or not, (& I don't) has become 1
of the most widely used tools, used by sighted & blind alike.

QRead happens to be a paid program. It seems also to be basically
abandoned, as in when its most recent incarnation broke keeping one's
place in the document, it was never fixed. I think because of the
nearly ubiquitous use of pdf documents, it's incumbant on screen
reader vendors to do whatever they can do to make these accessible. &
clearly a way to move forward doing just that has already been
implemented. So frankly I don't buy your argument. ""--

Perhaps NVDA should have the ability to recognize the character included but I don't have the technical knowledge to know if it can or if that would cause other problems in other cases.

I would not assume that NVDA should solve the problem.

GeneYou know what you do when you assume, so I try whenever & wherever
possible not to do so. But I do think that if screenreaders can (& do)
modify the appearance of documents or use objects to present material
to a screenreader user in correct order, etc in order to make certain
document types accessible, especially if these are very commonly used,
then pdf's certainly qualify. &, as stated previously, it's not like
it hasn't already been done. ""--

Also, in the case of PDF files, we've fixed a few things recently and so have Adobe, so do please try the latest version of Adobe reader with NVDA 2022.3 beta 1 which came out today.  All of the crashing issues should be gone to start with!  And having said that, do just go ahead and let me know of any ongoing crashes - I did kind of ask for that by saying that - but do restart your system and make sure you can still reproduce it first!
Also, if you CAN reproduce anything nasty like that with the beta, as always, do please create a GitHub issue: https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues

problem or an Adobe problem. Adobe Reader can convert PDFs to text
files. In most cases, those files are almost identical to what you see
in the PDF file. The exception being of course that there are no
headings, and if the PDF is an expandable tree, it will render in
Notepad as a regular document. I had a document that I think I was
going to try to convert and put spaces in once upon a time, but I
never did that, and when I opened that document to test, it displayed
properly. I vividly remember taking the time to put spaces in a text
document after converting it from PDF for a research project in
college. I'm tired tonight and probably won't have time to research
this before leaving town for the weekend tomorrow, but if I still have
this PDF, I can open it and report back probably Sunday or Monday.Quentin, as usual, thanks for a very helpful reply. that sample was
actually a very small part of a public document, ie, the Reaper up and
running 6.0 user's guide, & I can find so many like it, including
government documents, that it'd make your head spin & your eyes pop.

It's getting late here, but I'll install a portable copy of the beta
tomorrow & try it out. If the problem isn't remedied, I'll happily
file a report on Github.

Bob, Adobe crashed when I tried to save this particular document as
text, but having converted many to text myself, I can't really
remember a time when it's helped.

Its all daft. There are even some where the Adobe reckons its not tagged for reading order, but clearly is as Edge does not run columns together.

    GeneHi Group,

I might have mentioned this before on this list, but I have changed my default from Adobe to Microsoft Edge Browser to read PDF documents.  Edge works very well with it.  The tool bar is at the top giving you very accessible choices for cut, copy, save, save as zoom in/out and so on. And I very seldom get a PDF document that doesn't read well with the Edge browser. ""--

When it comes to brand names, in particular, it becomes insane.  The spelling variations in order to have ""unique branding"" is enough to drive anyone mad!

         ~ Vance PackardI don't know why you hate Edge.  It is a browser and is similar to other Chrome-based browsers.  There may be specific implementations of specific features you dislike but for reading PDF files, there is no difference between using it and other Chrome-based browsers except that it works much better in reading PDFs.  I would recommend you try it before prejudging it for this purpose.

I don't care which browser you like or use for general browsing but whatever you dislike about Edge doesn't apply in reading PDF files.

You can open PDF files in Edge in two ways.
Be on the file and use open with do do so.  Or when in Edge, use the command control o to open the open file dialog.
Then use it as you would any standard open dialog to open the file.

Do you hate Chrome as well?  That's a serious question.

I find that the similarities between all of the Chromium based browsers are far, far, greater than their differences.  And Chrome seems (and based on numbers of users, actually is) beloved by a massive number of people.  I love it as far as how it works, but refuse to use it because I have other options that are quite similar and where the use of same is not a data mining bonanza for Google.

I can't say that I hate Chromium-based browsers, but the two that are my daily drivers are Vivaldi and Brave.  Both are privacy focused by design and also have built-in ad-blocking and other security features.  While those can sometimes prove problematic (whether you're using a screen reader or not) with some sites, I just punt to an ""unprotected browser"" (usually Edge or my semi-protected Firefox) when the occasion dictates.

I touch Chrome almost never and do use Edge Dev Channel somewhat consistently.  Doing what I do I have to keep a finger on the pulse of Edge, since that's what most people who don't download alternatives and need a web browser are now using, just like they did with IE way back when.  It's the default under Windows for the ""less technologically sophisticated.""

An unassigned script to cycle through language and dialect switching modes has been added. 3 messages,"I am using Windows 10 21h2. Today I have updated nvda to 2022.2. I found An unassigned script to cycle through language and dialect switching modes has been added during reading the change log. Would anyone explain what this feature does and how I can utilise it? Would it change voice or tts automatically?It allows you to turn these features on and off without using the
    settings dialog, issuing a command that cycles through the options.

    

    The settings change the pronunciation of the synthesizer, if it
    supports the feature.  For example, if you go to a web page whose
    HTML says it is written in Spanish, NVDA will tell the synthesizer
    to pronounce things as they would be when speaking Spanish.  The
    same for different dialects.  

    

    GeneAlso, for anyone reading the change document (linked from the release announcement or the help menu) wondering about any particular update, the number at the end of the line is a link to the issue that update resolved.  In this case, ""An unassigned script to cycle through language and dialect switching modes has been added. (#10253)"" - so if you follow the link to https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/10253 the description (or at least the description of the problem part) is:""
In some cases, I need to deactivate auto-language switching:

Sometimes webpages are tagged with wrong language, e.g. written in French but tagged as English content. Probably due to a webmaster using a template or a default setting in English.
Sometimes I prefer reading English-tagged content with my default voice native language (French), e.g. math content.
On the opposite, sometimes I prefer have auto-language switching on to get used to real language pronunciation.
Pressing NVDA+Ctrl+V to go to voice settings panel, then tabbing in the dialog box to go to auto language switching option, activate it and press Enter is a bit long.""

You can read through the issue to find out all the conversation, but Gene has also summarised it succinctly here as well.

I’ll pass that along.The new version seems to have fixed the memory warnings that occasionally spuriously affected the older ones, so be sure its the latest on whenever you get it. I would say though that there are some instances where copy and paste is allowed but it remains silent. This is because it does not always know that a third party program is able to use the clipboard, I would suspect. I'm thinking of audio editors and some edit areas in some programs in the main.

Announce Current Version of Application 4 messages,"I've been searching the archives of this list but did not find anything. Would be grateful if somebody knows the answer.

Using another screen reader, there is a shortcut INSERT CONTROL V to announce the current version of the application being used. For example, if I press those keys now, it tells me I am using Microsoft Edge v. 104.

Is there a similar shortcut when using NVDA or will one of the add-ons perform this function?

Thanks for your feedbackThere may be an add-on that will do this.  I don't know of one. 
    However the about dialog of programs gives you that information. 
    You can get to it in most programs by opening help, alt h, then
    typing a, which opens about.  The version information is in the
    dialog.

    

    There are some programs such as Chrome browsers where you don't get
    the version number that way.  If you have problems, let us know the
    program you are using.

    

    GeneDownload Sources for Most Add-Ons (some home-grown ones will appear in neither location):
NVDA Add-Ons Directory (hosted by the Spanish-Speaking NVDA Community Association)
NVDA Community Add-Ons Site

A quick search on the word, ""version,"" on the NVDA Add-Ons Directory gives anyone who wants it their answer, at least right now.  I seem to recall that the NVDA Add-Ons Store is coming down the pike, but I could be mistaken about that.

         ~ Vance PackardBrian,
Must have not had enough coffee this morning and I never checked the community add-ons page. I only searched the archives here on Groups.IO . I did indeed find one that works perfectly on the add-ons page. Slightly different keystroke but the end result is perfect.

However, if any of you are doing any accessibility testing and the engineers are asking for browser data, I found this nifty little tool.
What browser? My browser? Is my browser out of date? (whatismybrowser.com)

Announcement of text-entry insert/overwrite state change? 4 messages,"Not sure if am just missing something, or if this is just the first time have noticed this, or something, but, if I double-press one of the insert keys to toggle change between text-entry insert, or overwrite modes, NVDA doesn't seem to be announcing the state change, or the then resulting state to me?


As in, should it be doing so, and is it thus likely one of the add-ons might be interfering with this announcement, or something?

"Announcement: NVDA Add-on Store is under development, NV Access folks are seeking feedback 8 messages","Hello NVDA community,The following notice is really meant for resident developers and early adopters (power users included) as it discusses prerelease software:For some time various communities hosted add-ons metadata and produced add-ons to browse and download add-ons. These include NVDA Store from French community, Tienda the Spanish community NVDA Store, and of course, Add-on Updater (not a store but an update client). Recently NV Access has shown interest in creating a central repository of add-ons and a store feature so users can browse, install, and update add-ons directly from NVDA without relying on store add-ons.After months of design and gathering early feedback, NV Access staff has published a pull request to let folks try it and give feedback:Addon store by feerrenrut · Pull Request #13985 · nvaccess/nvda (github.com) IMPORTANT: this is a pull request, a place to comment on design and direction of a new feature, change, or a bug fix. As Add-on Store is in early development, things can change without notice. Therefore, only developers and early adopters (especially add-on authors) are asked to provide feedback for now, either by commenting on the pull request itself or sending an email to info@... after trying out the linked pull request. A note for Add-on Updater users: as I promised years ago, once NVDA gains ability to update add-ons by itself, Add-on Updater will be discontinued. I’ll talk more about the “end game” once the linked pull request is integrated into NVDA in the future.Cheers,JosephThis is really great. I'd been seeing Github notifications about this. Are there designs to allow users to import repositories from other stores, like Spanish-only addons from a repo, stuff like that? Or will they all just be in one big list?
Devin Praterr.d.t.prater@...Hi,

I think the latter as these repositories (including the NV Access add-ons datastore) use different formats to store add-on metadata. For example, the default repo Add-on Updater uses (community add-ons website with compatibility info from a second repository) store add-on information in a dictionary format, whereas Spanish community and NV Access datastore use a list to store data. Also, the backend (server side) is different - the new datastore from NV Access wants to know which NVDA release the user is using so it can display compatible add-ons, whereas other repositories simply return a JSON dump of the entire database. As a result, Add-on Updater (and other store clients) must parse add-ons metadata to see if there are compatible add-ons based on compatibility information recorded in the database, whereas with the new NV Access datastore, only add-ons compatible with the current release are returned so clients do not have to do any work.

Cheers,

JosephAwesome, thanks!
Devin Praterr.d.t.prater@...Hi Joseph,

Can you please tell how to download the client?

Thanks,This is just the update add on which you can get from the nvda add ons site. Good luck.I wrote this on the add ons list but will put it here also. One idea assuming current add ons have a contact for the creator would be to have it notify the author, say once a month if it is about to be broken by an nvda version.
Also will modifying your add ons yourself still be a valid way to carry on, whether it be merely trying it with changed manifest, or doing some simple tweaks of syntax?

Regarding contacting authors about compatibility breaking releases: this is quite uncertain as to when that can happen, and to whom the message should be sent. Specifically, we (add-on authors) don't know when the first beta of a compatibility breaking release will be published (we can guess but plans can change), and not all authors have an active email address or other forms of contact. What you are suggesting is a valid concern.

Cheers,

I will take responsibility, as group moderator, for starting a procession ""down the wrong path"" for the group by answering the prior desktop shortcut for WordPad topic here on the NVDA group.  That question was not at all NVDA related, but Windows-related regardless of program, and yours is not NVDA-related, but WordPad related.

I have tried, and largely succeeded (with occasional lapses), to drive all non-NVDA-centric traffic to our Chat Subgroup, where the vast majority of messages are not actually ""chatty,"" but asking questions about specific programs just as you have.

I am locking this topic, and strictly because I want to keep the main group NVDA focused.  Yours is an excellent question, but one that should either be posed on our Chat Subgroup, or on the Windows Access for Screen Reader Users Group.  Subscription information for both follows.

However, and perhaps I misunderstood, but it sounds like the author suggests Jaws for Windows was the first screenreader for Windows. Nope. The first was Windows Bridge, from SynthaVoice Computers Inc. and was out at least three years before JFW.My first windows computer that I got in 2000 had window bridge in it.  But I felt so alone, because nobody could help me, because they either had jaws or window eyes in theirs.  Pam. Sent from Mail for WindowsVery good as a summary.  A complete history would have covered many more screen readers and their developers.

HowardI thought it was window eyes which I have used. It might have also been vocal eyes in 1994 or so. I remember quitting to windows or quitting to doss.I still miss ASAP and my Accent PC card. LOLHi, Pam, The very first computer I got had a demo version of window eyes. I had gotten it from Computers for the Blind in Texas. Rosemarie   Sent from Mail for WindowsThis article from AFB says that the first  Windows screen-reader was
    Window Bridge.

    https://www.afb.org/aw/1/4/16165

    The first screen reader for a Windows operating system was not
    released until 1992 when Syntha-Voice Computers released SlimWare
    Window Bridge for Windows 3.1.

    

    GeneHi: My first desktop computer was before Windows.  I started out
      by using one of the first in line of the Jaws For Dos programs. 
      However, the history of blind using computers goes back before a
      desktop computer existed.  I only know of paarts of the
      information, of which there was a program on punched cards that
      could be added to other punched card programs to make a IBM 1403
      Printer write in braille.  Also IBM had started work on software
      for the blind to use with some of the first IBM consoles, which
      was a large typewriter that you typed commands into a main frame
      computer.
    DaveI worked at IBM in Bolder Colorado in 1980. I could still see some then so used a magnifying glass and a CCTV. However, one day they brought in a Votrax synthesizer which connected to my terminal which made it speak. It wasn’t a great voice and didn’t have many, if any real controls to review things but it was a talking device. I met Ted when he worked at MCS as he helped me with tech support. I worked with him as a JAWS dealer starting in 1993 and am still a dealer although Ted has long-sense retired. He and Deane Blazie, who I also worked for in the early 90s were real pioneers along with Tim Kranmer. Karl  ------------------------------ Karl Smith

Alternate E-Mail:              karl.axistech@...I know this is not exactly screen reader related but if you wanna talk about it terms of my first experience with the Internet you could actually go back to newspaper audio text telephone information services where I lived in Kansas City there was a service called Startouch and there were other such services over the country in the 80s and 90s were you could enter a four digit code after calling a number for news weather and other information and it had what we would consider at that time were considered good synthesizers obviously the technology has improved my first screen reader that I remember using was Jaws 4.0 and windows 98 NotificationYes, there was:
TexTalker by Street
Screen Talk, Vocal-Eyes, and Window-Eyes by GW
Windows Bridge
Vert and Vert Pro
ProTalk
ISOSS
Flipper
ASAP
ASAW
Artic
Tiny Talk
VOS (Verbal Operating System)

And, probably, many more.  And each of them probably have a background story.  To do a proper history, one could write a book; not just an article.

HowardI also had Window Bridge, and I loved it! SWB did things that a lot of others didn’t…like seamless access to the command line, for instance. Sadly, Window Bridge 2000 wasn’t quite as good, IMO, and then Dave passed, and away went Synthavoice.

Mobile: (814) 431-0962You are correct but I think the article was really aimed at human interest describing Ted and the NVDA developers. A real history of how blind people have accessed computers in various ways would take a book. I met a man when I was in Jr. High who worked at the air force base near the school. He had a program I think he wrote which used the period on a line printer to smack the paper hard enough to emboss useable braille for him to read.

I don’t think I remember that, I’m only at version 3.9, soon to be 4.0, so I’m young enough to not remember all of that, still though, all of this is amazing, and if not for all of that we probably would not have the likes of nvda, and what ever else is being thought up.Hi,

Also there were In the early to mid-80's, the Echo, and echo2-plus I believe if memory serves me correct, and Artic's Business Vision.  And dating back to the first computer and screen reader access that I experienced which was while I was a student at the Community College of Philadelphia, 1984's Information through Speech systems which were designed and produced by Maryland Computer service. They've come so far from those days, and there's more than enough history for a book.

TonyYes, in my dos computer I had artic vision.  There was also Vert and Vert plus.  Pam. Sent from Mail for WindowsYeah. The Echo was for the Apple II line, and was introduced in the late
70s. You had to copy the software to drive the synth/screen-reader onto
every disk you wanted to talk, or else switch the disks once the speech was
loaded -- not a lot of room in memory on the Apple II E once the speech was
loaded, either.

Joshua Hendrickson""I was curious about the problem so I looked at the page.  This is an
    instance, which happens on some sites, where you can move to the
    field when browse mode is off.  When the page loads, turn browse
    mode off and tab.  You should find the field perhaps just by tabbing
    once and you can enter your search.  At times, I see a combo box
    that you can type in, at times, I've seen an edit field.  I don't
    know what accounts for that.

    

    This work around is important to keep in mind because it is
    necessary to be in focus mode on some sites to see some fields.

    

    GeneHi I feel like this issue started with the latest NVDA update... I just tested with narrator and jaws and both of them took me to the edit field by pressing the letter e.
Actually, I think I'm on the last update before the latest one because of addon compatibility issues... 
ThanksHi Robert,

I can confirm this. You can click on the advance search button and get a search field, but you can also move to the text that says: 'submit search,' press NVDA + space bar to go into focus mode, back tab once and then type in your search string. A bit clumsy, but id does wo4rk. ""--

nowadays and some of the different voices aren't all that bad.  It
does take some getting used to.  If you want to be a bit weird, play
around with the pitch and inflection.  Espeak can sound really weird
then.  It does get annoying after the first few minutes, but it is a
bit fun.

Joshua HendricksonIs there a windows desktop version on the Google TTS to be used with screen readers?Sometimes I do use espeak if I need something like that, It will get my attention and it is loud, at times.  I do need that for some of the things I do.Those are neural voices, and that api is expensive as that processing is taking place online.It is Live transcribe speech engine, not TTS.

BARD 2 messages,"Does anyone know of a BARD e mail list?This really is a question for the Chat Subgroup, but it's also a teachable moment for Groups.io, so I'll use it then lock the topic.

Though any mailing list may not be on Groups.io, it's easy to perform a search for ones that are:
1. Go to the Groups.io Group Search Page.
2. Enter your search term(s) in the search edit box.

    With kind regards
    

    
    DanielDaniel,
For addon-breaking releases it is possible that addon updates to addons may not get released during the beta cycle. Therefore, if you want to use NVDA knowing that it will work with Code Factory’s addon it is best to wait until the final
 NVDA update has been released.

Braille Voyager,"Hi,

At the weekend I tried again to get the Voyager to run.
Until NVDA 2019.2 I always had the native driver from
https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/1586
used. This worked fine. Here is a link to the archive:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrm455s86rojj2s/bram-nvda-voyager-89ddbb3a3bf2.zip?dl=1

Is there anyone here who can port this code to Python 3?
In fact, it's a kind of interface that NVDA uses with the
Voyager software connects. For example, the connection port must be
select in the
original software.

Another option would be to use Brltty, I'm on that
however, did not progress satisfactorily.
The only version I've gotten the line to work with is
4.4-1. At least brltty finds the line and nvda brltty. So far so good.

At the beginning of the line, the first 2 modules are empty, which is a line
with 70 digits is not a big problem. But the problem is that
when scrolling to the right, for example, these 2 characters are then
missing.

Another problem is the scrolling or better display errors. if
I read e.g. on a website with several links down
the first link lnk and the second then lnk lnk ... That's how it is in
a list with the same initial letters. Is the current row
longer than the next one, there is always a remnant of that at the back
previous line on the braille display.
When writing, the line also only shows scrap.
What am I doing wrong?

LG and thank you

Set column/row header is done with NVDA+C/R.
NVDA+F7 instead is used to open the list of elements dialog (sheets, notes, formulas, etc.)

Not clear what you exactly want to do.

Cheers,

CyrilleHi
    I know the funcionality of those hot key, but when I press that,
      it not work. For example, when I press NVDA+F7, NVDA just
      recognizes that I pressed f7, and it display the check spelling
      dialog. My keyboard it still good, and those functions still work
      in NVDA 2022.1rc1.

In Excel, is the focus on the spreadsheet itself (eg not in the ribbon) and what mode is Excel in? Eg if you were in the middle of typing in a cell, then those commands won't work (press enter or tab then try).

Can NVDA declare contains Data Validation in Excel cells? 3 messages,"Hi All,

As the title describes, when a cell contains data validation will NVDA users be able to get that information?
I use arrows to navigate in cells NVDA doesn't report this, however Narrator reports ""contains data validation"",
I also pressed NVDA+F to try to get that information without success.
If NVDA doesn't have that feature then I'd like to know if anyone has made a feature request in Github.

ThanksIf you have an ""input message"" set, then NVDA will read it when the cell gets focus.  If you have the data validation set to a list, then it will read that there is a submenu when you land on it.
If you have an error message set and try to set invalid data, then that will come up as an error dialog, and NVDA will read that when it appears.
If you don't have an input message or list set, then there is no visual indication that the cell contains data validation.  I just tested and yes, Narrator will report ""contains data validation"" on such a cell.
My feeling personally is that if Microsoft want users to know that then Excel should at least report it maybe in the status bar, but do feel free to create an issue for it.

Can we use SPSS and NVIVO with NVDA? 7 messages,"Hi, I'm a student majoring in social work. I need to learn SPSS and NVIVO. Does anyone know if these two software could be used with NVDA?

    I would say it is not completely accessible but at least usable.
    Especially if you can spend some time to explore the part that is
      controling the SPSS using some sort of code then you can skip lots
      of interactions with the GUI.

The difference between a top-flight creative man and the hack is his ability to express powerful meanings indirectly.
         ~ Vance PackardHi.  I couldn't use SPSS nearly twenty years ago with JAWS for a university statistics course, and I wasn't an NVDA user at the time.  I recall a discussion on this list about this, but I don't believe the alternative to the GUI was mentioned.  I wish I'd known about it.  I never used NVIVO.

LouiseHi,

When I used SPSS I found the experience both with Jaws and NVDA to be horrible. I was able to perform the basic important tasks such as reading the p values for whatever test you had to run such as Z test, but I had to get sighted assistance to simply get Jaws to read the two views after some work that the assistive technology instructor at my university did on their end. I will see if I can find the instructions on how to set up SPSS to work with Jaws because that is the only program that worked with SPSS. In closing my advice would be to work with your professor and explain that this software is nearly inaccessible with my screen reader. I wish you the best.Oh the author had also mentioned about NVIVO?
    

    
    I would say NVIVO is a software totally inaccessable with screen
      reader.
    When NVIVO was still in version 9 or 10 I have contacted their
      support services reporting to them the accessible issue, and their
      staff told me that I could use the accessibility features build in
      to windows to access their software, and what they meant were
      NVIVO support windows magnifier, lol.
    Later in 2021 or 2020, they have explicitly mentioned in their
      blog or something saying that NVIVO is accessable using narrator
      on win and voiceover on mac.
    I have tried installing the trial version on both windows and mac
      and turn out it is completely inaccessable, I could not imagine
      how they could make the claim that it is accessible.

    Louise Pfau 於 11/8/2022 03:30 寫道:As far as SPSS in command-line mode, see:  SPSS: Working with Command Syntax

For the full ""flotilla"" of SPSS documentation (the Manuals section is likely to be very handy): IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0.1 Documentation

There are documents on that page entitled Accessibility.pdf for various OSes and languages.  JAWS is explicitly mentioned in the English Accessibility.PDF and there is a JAWS dictionary file they propose you add to your collection.

But, in the end, I suspect that blind users will be far better off using the now-ancient but still supported command line syntax.  Particularly if you're working with pre-existing data sets.  I think my time with SPSS occurred after I was done with the punch-card phase of a computer science program but it was still command line setting things up in files on a monochrome monitor or tractor-feed paper equivalent, with keyboard.  Ah, the days when 300 BAUD was considered insanely fast.

My first recommendation when any browser peculiarity appears is to clear, and I mean completely clear, browser cache (not cookies or browsing history, but cache) by the method of your choosing.  That often gets rid of these odd misbehaviors.

Would you mind sending the URL (either via private message or on group) for the page where you're having the problem.  Whether or not one has valid login credentials should not matter based on what you've been saying, as it seems you can't get to the edit boxes (or some of them).

This is another of those issues that really is not going to be solved ""in the abstract.""  Examination of actual behavior on the page is the key to zeroing in on what's happening and not happening.

     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedBy the way, the Firefox Settings has five true settings panes - General, Home, Search, Privacy & Security, Sync - plus the allied More from Mozilla Pane.

I get to the ""Pane List"" by hitting SHIFT + TAB 3 times immediately after opening Settings, at which point you will be on the General Pane entry and can down arrow until you hit Privacy & Security Pane.  For any pane, hitting TAB 4 times from the Pane List gets you to the first setting in that pane.

There may be an easier way, but my ""quick and dirty"" testing didn't uncover it.

I can confirm this (even though there's no need to confirm what Quentin is saying) and have had internet service ""burps"" when an update was in the process of downloading, and it never checks in the background again on that day.  I generally just wait until I get the next, ""Do you want to update?,"" prompt.  If I'm in a rush then I just download the installer directly from the NVAccess Download Page.

        ~ Dorothy NevillYup I confirm this one, Also yesterday, though my main copy at home updated successfully after I manually forced it. One on a machine connected by a 4g cellular dongle failed to complete, getting slower as the download progressed. I can only assume that the connection was taking too long or losing packets, since it took nearly10 mins then said it had failed.
Could be loading or  maybe local Vodafone issues, I'll try again today, but am taking a portable copy with me just in case!

Clipboard inquiry 5 messages,"Hi listers: I use a couple applications which copy data to the clipboard. I know I can press NVDA+C to read out the clipboard contents.  However, sometimes, I am told the clipboard contains a large portion of text.  In my case, this is a lot of actual blank space.  Is there any way to override this so NVDA will read it out anyway? Thanks! Sent from Mail for WindowsNVDA doesn't read anything that is a certain amount of characters or
    more.  I assume the blank space is in the form of something like
    spaces, which are characters.  

    

    I've pretty much given up writing tickets with suggestions.  I've
    written about five and in no case have any of them come even close
    to being adopted.  But you may want to create a ticket with the
    suggestion that the size of what is on the clipboard should not
    cause it not to be read.  It is not the screen-reader's business to
    control what the user hears in a case like this based on some notion
    of what the developers think is good for us.  Speech can be stopped
    with control, just as it can at any other time and this limitation
    is unnecessary and limits the user without justification.

    

    GeneA workaround for those occasions where you have a huge amount of data on the clipboard would be to paste same into Notepad or Word and then read it from there.

I generally know precisely what I've cut (or copied) to the clipboard, but there are occasions where I still end up pasting it into a text editor to review when it was a massive text copy.  I just don't do those very often.

I'd have thought that some way to edit out all but one space in a file that is in the clipboard as a kind of toggle might be nice, though how this could be done I'm not sure. As has been said the clipboard to a text editor trick is what I tend to d, but should really not have to.

Code Blocks and NVDA 7 messages,"Good day everyone. I have just started a class in C++ and the instructor said that we will be using code blocks as the IDE. I have installed it and I typed up a sample file and saved it but when I run it it just brings me right back to the text area. Does anyone know if NVDA is accessible with this application? If so, where do I go from here?I have never used this IDE
I found this information/web site from the information you provided:https://www.codeblocks.org/
The latest news on that site was from March 2021.
I wonder if you would be better off using VS Code...Perhaps you can discuss this with your instructor.
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp
RussThanks for your response. I am familiar with VS Code and I discussed it with him, but it seems that setting up C++ with VS code will be more work. I had visited that link and it was speaking of even downloading a compiler separately. So i was wondering if there was some way I could get around this code blocks.TheeQuinn Public wrote:

blocks.Often, a compiler like GCC can be used, which is commandline based. You can do the coding in NotePadPlusPlus or the like. The compile tools like Make or Scons also tend to be commandline based.

If you're in the U.S., they probably have to accommodate your situation by allowing a different software, since learning Code Blocks is not the primary function of the class, but learning C++ is.
Though I'm not a lawyer so that's only a speculation.

I have never programmed C++ in an IDE, but always just written it in text editors and used a commandline compiler to do the actual compilation.

Now, all of that said:

Looking at the docs and site for Code Blocks, it does appear that it should be accessible, at least to some extent.
However, you definitely do have to either install your own compiler, or download the version that includes a compiler with it.

Your class should have provided a document with step by step install instructions. It sounds like you may not have gotten a compiler, meaning their instructions are deficient.

Following the trail from this page:
https://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php/Installing_the_latest_official_version_of_Code::Blocks_on_Windows

it appears that the version with the compiler included can be got here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/20.03/Windows/codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe/download
or here:
https://www.fosshub.com/Code-Blocks.html?dwl=codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe

(Though I wish they would switch to GitHub like sane people.)

You might want to dump your current version and try installing that one.

LukeAlso, you might want to continue this on nvda-devel (https://groups.io/g/nvda-devel), or better yet program-l (https://www.freelists.org/list/program-l).

LukeHi there. Hope you're doing great.

I have used dev cpp, vs code, and visual studio for c++.
if you really want to use any IDE for c++, I'll recommend visual
studio if your pc can afford it.
otherwise, dev is fine, but it is not very much accessible though.
if you don't want to use any IDE, then you can try gcc with any text
editor. like notepad or notepad++.

Thanks.You also have visual studio 19 besides vs code.
    They both have free options and work well with screen readers.
    You may have a better time with visual studio for c++.",558,7,0.012544803,0.012544803,1,620,29.38,26.09,39.21,26.57,18.79,18.23,84.68,66.61,53.71,14.03,7.9,3.39,0.16,3.55,0.16,0.65,6.13,11.61,5.16,1.29,10.81,10.65,6.29,7.58,1.13,19.03,4.03,1.94,1.94,0.16,1.13,0.65,18.23,0.81,17.42,1.94,2.42,3.39,5.48,0.32,7.26,0,3.06,1.77,1.29,1.45,0.32,1.13,0,0,0,0,10,4.52,0.32,0.16,0,0,2.74,5.48,0,0,0,0.16,2.58,0.16,0,2.42,6.61,0,0.32,6.29,0,0,0.16,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0.65,0.97,0.97,0.16,0,0,0,0.16,0.48,6.13,6.29,0,0.81,4.35,1.13,0.16,0,2.42,4.19,4.35,2.1,1.13,1.13,0,0,0,26.61,9.52,3.55,0.48,0,0.97,12.1

Code Factory add-on updated! 2 messages,"Hi everyone,
Following on from the confusion around the update to the Code Factory NVDA add-on.  I reached out to them earlier today and they have confirmed that the add-on has been updated and the version on the site now IS the new update.  It is compatible from NVDA 2019.3 through to the current NVDA 2022.1.
It's a little confusing as the file name is the same, but it is the new one.  Please do download it from: https://codefactoryglobal.com/app-store/voices-for-nvda/
If you have any issues with it, please do reach out to Code Factory.
Kind regards
Quentin.

I thought I still had the email but I can't find it. I don't know what
to look for.Can you just install the update over your existing copy of the addon or
do you have to remove the old one?There's no need to remove the old addon. You will need to provide the product activation again.If purchased directly from Code Factory, the email should be from Avangate Customer Service.You mentioned having to give the product activation number again upon updating, thus would you recommend deactivating the key we have, and reactivate it upon updating? I wouldn’t want for my keys count to decrease by one. Thanks for enlightenment.

GeraEnviado desde mi iPhone SE (2nd Generation) de TelcelI think you can get the code also from the eloquence add on itself. I believe I found it in there. Under nvda then  code factory.Good luck.Hi: I did some testing and here is what I found out. If you update NVDA, it will disable the add-on, which you are warned about. When you install the new update to the add-on, it also removes any Vocalizer voices installed.  It also deletes the activation from the computer, so you will need to enter your activation code again. If you have not updated yet, but, aren’t sure where your code is, you may be able to retrieve it from the About tab in the settings. Press NVDA+N and go down to Code Factory, Press Enter twice to open up the settings dialog.  Go into the about tab and press tab until you hear “Enter activation key”.  Your key should be displayed and selected.  If you press CTRL+C on it, it will copy the key to the clipboard.  You can then save it to a text file or just keep it there.  If you keep it on the clipboard, you can then update both NVDA and the add-on.  Once you have restarted NVDA with the new version of the add-on installed, you can go into the Code Factory menu selection, and re-activate with the key you previously copied to the clipboard. You will need to re-download any Vocalizer voices after the activation. You should not loose any of your activations, since your computer ID string will not change. Hope this helps.Sent from Mail for WindowsOh darn! I already updated it! I'm screwed! I thought I could find my
key easily. I thought I kept the email. If I did, I don't know where
to look for it.I don't know that's is a good idea to leave it on the notepad
      now, then do the update.  I'd save the code to a file somewhere,
      that you can retrieve it from later.  If left on notepad and not
      saved somewhere and the no button is pressed when closing notepad
      to make the restart for updating it is lost.
    DaveOkay, I remembered that I had activated it on another computer when I
was living somewhere else and coming back for the holidays. I got my
key from the other computer and made sure to save it in a file on my
flash drive. So it's activated on my main computer now, and I will
never lose my key. Now I just have to send another email to AT Guys,
as I had already contacted them saying I lost my key. Now I have to
tell them I found it!Well if you try performing a search for something like ""codefactoryglobal.com"" or ""code factory"" in Outlook you should find the key (I found mine this way).
Now I can finally enjoy the new NVDA update...For me I got it from the AtGuys website under account, click view in your order.Oh, I didn't know it could be found that way. But I've got my key now.
I'll keep this information in mind just in case.This is great news, Joseph. Thank you so much.

Connecting An Orbit 40 To A Computer Running NVDA 8 messages,"Folks,
 
In order to connect an Orbit Research Orbit 40 Braille display to a computer running NVDA you must put the Orbit 40 into the varioultra40 emulation mode, and set the Orbit 40 to use the hid orbit USB connection type.
You must then go to the NVDA braille settings and select the Baum/Humanware/APH/Orbit braille displays driver.  When I select this driver and hit OK, I get “Braille Display Error  dialog  Could not load the baum display.”.
 
Has anyone seen this error?  Is anyone using an Orbit 40 with NVDA; if so, what is your braille driver setting?
 
I have tried the NVDA automatic mode Braille option and, while that loads, the Orbit 40 does not connect to it.  Orbit research says this is an NVDA issue.
 
Any help would be appreciated.

I have no Braille display, but I read about this problem somewhere in passing, so maybe there is another way to make them  talk to each other. Would you not have thought that their other model might share the same drivers?

Connection of pc to Signal messenger or WhatsApp 8 messages,"Hi all.


Is there a better way to connect your pcc to whatsapp or Signal messenger? I mean is there a better way to do that but to scan a QR code?


Reards

DanielNope.  I can do it only because I have a very good phone, I just point my  phone at the screen and it just works. If you have something like an iPhone 8 or older, you can do it but you will have issues.Btw your best bet would be the chat group.  Go to the sub groups for nvda group on groups.io and look for the heading labeled sub groups, if they did make that public.

The camera doesn't have to be positioned exactly, and just moving it around slowly with the built-in code scanner running, usually works. That assumes you can use either the built-in code scanner, or can use one in whatever app you're running that is constant pick-up, not point-and-snapshot.

LukeI seldom have a screen connected to most of my computers, so I feel their attitude is a little restrictive when most other systems seem to be happy using short texts or sending a code to a separate email address.
Not really nvdas fault, just all part of the fuzzy thinking when it comes to accessibility vs security.

I finally managed to connect my signal to my pc. It works just fine.


But i still have a problem with using it under NVDA.


When i am scrolling through the messages, it still reads buttons and lines when the focus is on a message in a chat window. With the other screenreader, i don't havve that problem. You know, the dhark. :-)


Is there a way to turn that off for NVDA so i can read the messages easier?


Regards

Try NVDA + Space to switch to browse mode and see if it helps. Thanks.Hello there.


No it's not that. When entering a signal chet, the NVDA is switching to edit mode. I know that. But when that happens, i can only navigate in an empty edit field. *grins* So i am switching to browse mode but then it reads, what i described in my prior mail.

Creating New Activities or Profiles 2 messages,"Hey everyone, I want to set NVDA so it shows computer braille only in the terminal, but otherwise use UK grade 2 everywhere else. Can someone remind me how to make  new activity or profile please? Harmony.Every NVDA user needs to know how to do two basic things when almost any question arises.  The one you want really depends on the exact nature of the question:
1.        Bring up the NVDA Commands Quick Reference:  NVDA + N, H, Q  [NVDA Menu, Help, Commands Quick Reference]
2.      Bring up the NVDA User Guide:  NVDA + N, H, U   [NVDA Menu, Help, User Guide]

In your case bring up the User Guide, and have a read through the entirety of Section 12.4, which covers how to create and manage configuration profiles.  The user guide does a very good job with this, but it's important to have read through the whole section, once, before you start.

Deezer 2 messages,"Hi,

maybe this has been a topic here before, but I don't remember reading a
solution:
I have subscribed to the Deezer streaming service. I use the service
mainly via my smartphone.
But now I have also installed the Windows app. I have noticed the
following phenomenon:
When I started the Deezer app, it is practically unusable with NVDA. When
moving with the tab key or the cursor keys, NVDA remains mute.
If I then turn on Narrator, the items are read aloud by both Narrator and
NVDA.

Is this due to a setting in NVDA that the items are not spoken in the
Deezer app? What settings are needed so that Nvda alone also reads the
items aloud?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Yours sincerely

Arno

Discord verification with nVDA 5 messages,"Hey everyone.I use Discord a fair amount nowadays and generally find it to be quite friendly. However today I ran across a server that has a rules channel with a bot that requires you to “hit a green checkmark” to notify that you’ve read and accept the rules. There’s a message that says “react her:”, and I presume the green checkmark is somewhere around there – but it’s not being announced with nVDA and the “reactions menu” just shows a bunch of response graphics.Anyone have any thoughts on how one can check the green checkmark using the keyboard and NVDA?I’m not going to give the specific server link in public here on the list, but am hoping maybe someone has encountered this before.Thanks.So, this is how I have my server set up as well. You must hit the checkmark. It’s actually at the bottom after the list of reactions. It will say enter to react, not pressed. It enter on it and you should be fine. If it says not pressed
 after you react then you’re successful. Or at least you should be, depending on the bot.





Get Outlook for iOSHey Sarah. The bot is “karl bot” and, the instructions about having to check the checkmark are clear enough, but I cannot seem to do it. After the bot’s name it says “react here”. I can get the reactions to come up and there are a whole bunch of them, presumably set up by the server owner. One of them is a checkmark, but I can’t even tell if it is pressed or not. I just haer “check mark – graphic 1” either way.I sort of figured out how to do this on my phone, in that there’s a buncho f stuff you can select, and by selecting one of the unlabeled things, it allowed me to see the other server channels. But the weird thing is that it doesn’t seem to “stick” … I can go to another channel, but then after a while it just tells me the messages can’t be loaded and I only see the “rules” and ‘welcome” channels again.Odd.Yeah looks like the server is broken. The reactions should bat the bottom after the graphics, if the server owner designed the rules channel correctly, if not, you might have to contact the server owner for help.
Good luck.

They are a line of equals signs, interspersed with hyphens. So dash equals dash equals etc. Probably your punctuation level is set not to say one or the other, so you think it's a line of just one of them.

Most likely that's what's happening in the original case as well: equals signs along with another character that NVDA doesn't read.
Confirm by reading that line character by character.

LukeI just got a similar email from Amazon, and having seen this thread,
looked over it to see what it looked like. There are spaces between
the equals signs, which is why NVDA reads it the way it does. I
personally find those quite annoying.Hmm. Ok, I might try and filter that out in an outlook specific profile or
something as yeah that looks awful!Hi,

JAWS has it, it's called Filter Repeated Characters, and is under Text Processing.

As far as I can see, NVDA doesn't have it.

SteveWhich is quite bad, because what if you get the string 9= in a file, maybe for programming?

It should say Equals repeats nine times.

All the best

SteveYou might want to maybe put that issue in as a github issue, or if you can code, make an add on if one does not exist.I like 9 equals rather than equals repeats 9 times, but that's just me. It's faster  verbiage IMHO.It does have it.  If it didn't, you would hear something like equal
    repeated as many times as it appears on a line.  Instead you hear
    twenty equals, if there are twenty equals uninterrupted on a line.

    

    If your punctuation isn't set at a level where the sign is spoken,
    you will hear nothing.  So with equal, if punctuation is set to
    none, you won't hear anything.  With punctuation set to some or
    higher, you will hear the announcement.  However, I know of no way
    to turn the feature  off or on and I don't know if that matters.

    

    GeneHiThe answer to the question is yes, NVDA does have the feature that identifies repeating characters, it just delivers the information in a different way to Window Eyes. Cheers                Chris Sent from Mail for WindowsHi Gene,

    

    It does have it for single character strings. I believe what they
    are asking is if there are multiple character repetitions whether
    that feature is active.

    

    Here's an example of what I mean. 

    

    9=9=9=9=9=9=9=9=9=

    

    NVDA doesn't have a setting for such strings as does JAWS sand
    Window-Eyes.

      escreveu:I hear 9 equals 9 equals etc. sounds like it does have this to my ear.  Is that not what you mean?My solution to this is to create default dictionary entries to handle common ""separator line"" repetitions and actually have NVDA say, ""separator line.""  I don't care what, precisely, the chosen character sequence is.

Here is the regular expression I use for a ""long"" separator line of 3 or more characters in sequence.  Additional characters could be added with the or (pipe) operator if you have someone who uses something else in combination with + or = or -, etc.

(\+|-|\*){3,}

and my replacement is ""Separator line.""  

For common short, 2-character separators, I use this regular expression:   (-|\*|\+){2}\s+$

And that regular expression captures 2 characters that are hyphens, asterisks, or plus signs followed by any number of white space characters anchored by the end of the line.

Does NVDA run on Windows 10 IoT Enterprise? 3 messages,"Hello Everyone.

"Does anyone ever have to use NVDA and narrator together and find that when you turn off narrator, the system sound volume goes down 12 messages","Occasionally, I have to use NVDA and narrator concurrently because on some websites, narrator seems to work better particularly on old Internet Explorer websites with lots of .jsp JavaScript running.
Whenever however I turn off narrator, the system sound volume goes down although NVDA speech remains at the same volume, to fix it I can restart NVDA but it gets a bit laborious after a while.
Does anyone know what might be causing this or how I could stop it?
I have turned audio ducking off on both NVDA and narrator as well.Yes I've noticed this only the other day on a friends laptop. It also seems to occur if you have something like Guide connect on the machine and then try to exit and re enter it, but need to use windows both with narrator and nvda.
Obviously its confusing the heck out of the audio drivers??

in the display name field.This problem can be solved by doing the following one if they are both running at the same time quit narrator, to quit NVDA three restart NVDA. This will fix the issueThe issue is caused because narrator usees audio ducking. Even if unchecked. It still insists on using this.Yep I’ve noticed this since maybe February or so when I’ve had to test stuff with both and have had to use both at the same time.  The work around I to restart nvda after shutting down narrator.Also, you can go trolugh the audio ducking options of NVDA as a
      workaround.
    Regards,
    mk.Actually those are off but nvda still will duck  when using both screen readers at the  same time.  The fastest work around  is to press windows R. then type nvda, then enter. NvDA will restart and the problem will go away.If you have a shortcut key such as control alt n, using that will
    cause it to restart.

    

    GeneI actually keep forgetting about that as I don’t have a short cut key, I disabled that long long ago. Because of how fast I eype it really for me does not take much time to do the method I described as well. Lol! Happy Friday.You know, I did not know until these post that you could use both at the same time.  Is this done a lot?
from a new user.
Keith ReedyNo it is not.  I only did it as narrator could access parts nvda could not in regard to a program, but I think I can only count on one hand the times I've done this over the now 12 years I've been using NVDA.Sarah k Alawami wrote:

When doing so, I have usually put NVDA to sleep on the application in question.

Of course, more naturally I just quit NVDA, start Narrator, quit Narrator, and start NVDA. But probably a number of times I can count on one hand, I've had real reason to have them both running. And no, I don't recall why.

Donating through the paypal app 7 messages,"Hi all 
     
    Was just wondering, is it at all possible to
      make a donation
      to NV Access through the paypal app itself. I am using IOS. 
     
    If so, how would one accomplish this.
     
    With kind regards 
     
    DanielI would imagine so, since the NVAccess Donation Page uses PayPal as the transfer method (at least by default, you can use bank transfer and they give the information there for that).

For the $30 one-time donation, the donation URL is:  https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amount=30.00&business=admin@...&currency_code=AUD&no_shipping=1&rm=1&item_name=Donation%20For%20NVDA&cbt=Return%20to%20NV%20Access&cpp_header_image=https://www.nvaccess.org/images/logo.png&return=https://www.nvaccess.org/?donation=1 

Even though it's long, that indicates that the PayPal address for NVAccess is admin@..., the currency being used on the website is Australian Dollars (but I'm sure any currency will be fine, as PayPal converts), and the specific amount in that case is $30.

Using the same PayPal address in the app should result in the money going to precisely the same place no matter where in the world you're donating from.

        ~ Dorothy NevillJust confirming what Brian said - using our site is a convenience, since it auto fills all that information, but you could do it directly from the PayPal app or site, and that way, as Brian noted, you could choose to donate £14 or ¥500 or any amount in any other currency you can access.  Anything you donate gets converted to Australian dollars.  There is a small fee, but it's much less than paying directly via the bank.

There is no way to answer that question that's meaningful in the long term, or even for hours at times.

Your best bet, regardless of the currency you're starting with, is to use Google or any web search engine to convert the amount into Australian Dollars (AUD).

Entering ""30 USD to AUD"" (sans quotes) or ""500 JPY in AUD"" if you were using Japanese Yen or ""30 EUR in AUD"" if using Euros.  And that's if you're donating in those currencies in the app.

From what I can tell about the URL at the NVAccess Donation Page, it takes $30 AUD from the source you specify, so you'd have to do the conversion in the opposite direction, ""30 AUD in USD"" to know how much would come out of your PayPal account regardless of payment source.

Right now $30 US is $44.16 Australian.    $30 Australian is $20.68 US.   That will be different, even if only slightly, tomorrow.  Exchange rates change moment to moment and are sometimes very stable for a period of time and others vary wildly very quickly.

        ~ Dorothy NevillThanks, I do know about the volatility of exchange rates, just wanted to get some idea of what it might be.  I donated only one time in the past and was thinking of doing it again soon.  MarilynYes but I used to do it every time a new version came out and the system from the web site did tell you all you wanted to know if you  donated in AU dollars, in my case UK pounds. Since its so much cheaper than bank transfer, I now have a regular monthly donation and it comes out on the bank statement and it varies accordingly each month, making sure the actual amount at the far end is always the same.

Double Entry Bookkeeping/professional accounting software 10 messages,"Hello

I am looking for some NVDA accessible double entry bookkeeping software. In other words, a business accounting package.

I currently use Zero, which is a web based accounting service, but its interface is clunky, and not always as accessible as it could or should be. I want very much to get away from it.

Fifteen or so years ago I used SQL-Ledger for a while, but it had security and other issues (it was also web based, but you had to install and administer it on your own server). I switched briefly to LedgerSMB which was created as a replacement and to solve the problems of SQL-Ledger, but now seems defunct.

I think I would prefer something standalone, although if there is a really good web based system I haven't tried that has a high degree of NVDA compatibility, I'd be open to it.

Any pointers gratefully received.

LukeHave you considered Quick Books?Hi Luke!

See the link below to ""Wave Apps.""  It is reputed to be accessible.  I have
no personal experience with it, but *a lot* of accounting experience.

They do seem pretty accessible, although I remember running into several very awkward UI choices that made them somewhat less than smooth, though over all usable.

They are probably where I'll end up if I can't find anything preferable.

What other software have you had experience with?

Someone mentioned Quickbooks. With Intuit's crummy accessibility record, I hadn't really considered them to be viable, although I admit never having bought a copy to test accessibility.

Lukehi there, I would also suggest quick books. not sure where you are based? but know  an organisation here in the uk who have been working with them on accessibility and now recommend them to blind business owners. good luck and if it would help can put you in touch with the organisation recommending them in uk. thank you. Mo.Hi Luke,

The choices are *very* limited.  I have heard that the online version of
QuickBooks is somewhat accessible, though I dislike the fees involved.  Its
desktop version is woefully inaccessible.  As far as professional
double-entry bookkeeping applications go, I think this is pretty much it.


HTH,
RichardWhen I last used it a couple years back, QBO was inaccessible to the point where I felt my stress levels rise every time I had to use it. As in, they slapped the wrong ARIA attributes on things like tables and royally screwed things up. I basically hired an accountant to swoop in and clean things up regularly. And I write web apps as part of my livelihood, so it isn't a case of me needing more training or whatnot.

If things have changed then good I suppose, but as far as I'm concerned they've got dominant market share and abuse it. The accountants I reached out to only worked with QBO, and while I don't object to paying for software, feeling coerced into working with an industry standard, by yet another company that introduces more barriers to blind entrepreneurship, left a sour taste in my mouth.

Good luck. I think in the future I'll just use command line stuff, and find an accountant who gets it. Bookkeeping is too integral that I can't afford for it to not be accessible to me.Nolan Darilek wrote:

Good luck. I think in the future I'll just use command line stuff, and find an accountant who gets it.I was tempted to find one of the online accounting platforms with an API (Wave has one, I think), and write either a commandline or Python full screen interface for it.

It just takes a lot of time

I'm in the U.S., but I'd probably prefer QB desktop if it's accessible somehow. Although, as Richard B.

Could someone guide me how please?Generally, that isn't the best place to get them, you should do as David suggested, or get them via the Add-ons Manager in the NVDA Tools menu, which takes you to the same place.

But if you really must get an add-on from GitHub, go to the add-on's repository. The URL will look something like this:

https://github.com/author/add-on-name

To download a packaged add-on, select ""releases"", and look for the release with the highest version number (usually).

You can also go directly to https://github.com/author/add-on-name/releases

For example, if you wanted my Numpad Nav Mode add-on, you could go to:

https://github.com/opensourcesys/numpadNavMode/releases

But it's much easier to get it from the official add-ons site as described above.

LukeThank you David for sharing the link.But Have found some other useful add-ons which are not available in the official site.Thanks,Ravi.Dear Luke,
Thank you for the detailed explanation. Let me give it a try.
Responding to your initial question, some of the add-ons  are not available
in the official site.
And when we try to get them then we are guided to the GitHub site mostly.
That's why I tried to get it. But have not succeeded till now. Let me try as
you have mentioned.

Those of us on the add-ons list can help those authors get their add-ons on the official site, it's much easier these days than it used to be. (Whether it should be is a question for another day.)

You can try writing to those authors and ask them to put their add-ons on the official site, or tell them to write to the add-ons list and one of us will help them.

LukeI think what often happens is that somebody will have a project in work, and want a newbie to test it, and instead of appreciating the convoluted workings of Github, will point at their space and leave it to the newbie to find the right link. It can be a real trial.
If anyone is working this way, I agree that letting a new user try your add on is good as they can find bugs  by doing things you would never think of doing, but send them the link directly via email, to the actual file. I speak from experience of being asked to do this. No criticism intended on developers, just remember not everyone knows the github site.

Editing an NVDA Add-On Manifest file as a Temporary Workaround 14 messages,"Editing an NVDA Add-On Manifest file as a Temporary Workaround

Moderator's Note:  This post is about exactly what it says, a temporary workaround.  This is NOT the way to truly fix add-on compatibility issues in many cases, but it will work as a temporary workaround for some in a pinch. You use these instructions completely at your own risk.


Note Well:  This will NOT always work when there is a backward compatibility breaking release of NVDA because, sometimes, add-on code must be changed.  But it sometimes works if nothing more than testing and certification is needed for a given add-on, and that’s a bit behind the actual NVDA release.  Also, the %APPDATA% folder is normally hidden, so if your machine objects to your trying to navigate there, you will have to take the steps to show hidden files and folders on your machine.
Your NVDA Add-Ons are found in the following folder:
%APPDATA%\nvda\addons
and you can type (or cut and paste) the exact path shown above into the Address combo box in File Explorer, and after hitting Enter that’s where you’ll be.  A list of folders corresponding to each of the add-ons you have installed will be in the file list.  Locate the add-on for which you wish to edit the manifest file and open its folder.
In the folder you will find a file with the name manifest.ini.  It is a plain text file, so can be opened for editing with any plain text editor of your choosing.  I use Notepad, but any text editor will do.
Once you have the file open for editing, search for the line that starts with:  lastTestedNVDAVersion =
You will be substituting the current NVDA version number for whatever is currently shown after the equal sign.  It is critical that there be a space after the ‘n’ in “version” as well as after the equal sign itself.  The NVDA version goes after that space after the equal sign.  If you check out the line character by character after the ‘n’ in “version” as you found it, you’ll encounter those spaces.  Just make sure that the equal sign has a space before it, and after it.
This will trick NVDA into believing that the add-on has been tested up to and including the current NVDA version number.
If an add-on crashes or otherwise misbehaves after using this workaround, then work on its code will be required.
If you use this workaround, and become aware that a version of your add-on that has actually been tested with the latest version of NVDA has become available, definitely take the time to install the real version.  Your doctored manifest.ini file will end up being overwritten as part of installing “the real thing.”

You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.
     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedA couple of tips:

1. There's another way to get to the NVDA user configuration directory for installed copies.
NVDA installs a shortcut in the start menu called Explore NVDA user configuration directory. Typing explore nvda into the search box should find it.
2. On nvda-addons.org, there's an addon that will do all the work for you called cricricri:
https://nvda-addons.org/addon.php?id=228
The documentation is in Spanish, but you simply have to install it, go to the NVDA menu, Tools, Date changer for manifests.
From there, check the addons you want, set the major version to 2022 and apply.Brian,
    

    
    I think you'll find that the path to the NVDA add-ons folder is %APPDATA%\Roaming\nvda\addons

No, it's not.  The Roaming folder is the last one in the path represented by %APPDATA%.

It's easy enough to check for yourself in Command Prompt by issuing the command:
echo %APPDATA%
if you don't believe me.  I don't post these instructions without having triple checked things first.

     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The Dispossessed%appdata% is roaming, %localappdata% is local.Good morning, last year I created a small add-on to modify the
      manifests in a simple way.

      

      This add-on has english translation and below I leave the
      translated manual.

      

      This is the repository:

      

      https://github.com/hxebolax/cricricri-para-NVDA

      

      And from here you can download the latest version:

      

      https://nvda.es/files/get.php?file=cricricri

      

      As colleagues say changing the manifest is something that does not
      ensure its operation if the add-on requires internal changes in
      the code but in most cases if it will work to continue using the
      add-ons.

      

      If I recommend to be attentive to the updates and to update the
      add-on even if it works with the changed manifest because the
      updates can bring changes in the code for a better performance.

      

      Next I leave the manual of the add-on that is very simple and we
      will be able to change in a single blow all the manifests of our
      installed add-ons that we have chosen and in a simple way.

      

      Manual of cricricri for NVDA

      Small add-on that will help us to change the date of the
      manifests.

      Now according to the latest NVDA policy and until further changes,
      every year in the first version of NVDA programmers will have to
      change the version to match their manifest to the NVDA version.

      There will be programmers who will do it immediately, others who
      will take some time and others who simply won't do it due to
      add-on abandonment or any other reason.

      In this last case we will have to make the change of the
      lastTestedNVDAVersion property by hand and if we have many plugins
      we will have to waste time, besides it is not a task for all users
      since there are many levels of users.

      Also if we want to test the betas and RCs we will have to change
      this parameter in the manifests otherwise we will not be able to
      have the add-on installed.

      Well cricricri helps us in this task doing the process for us and
      quickly.

      Using cricricri

      Cricricri can be launched from the menu Tools / Date changer for
      manifests or add a shortcut in Preferences / Input gestures and
      look for the category cricricri.

      Once opened the window is simple we will have a list with our
      plugins and their version in the manifest.

      We will be able to choose the ones we want.

      If we tab we have two buttons, select all or deselect all, little
      to say this will act on the list of plugins.

      If we tab we will fall in three combo boxes:

      - 

      Select major version: This combo box has to match the date of the
      version that NVDA is going to have.

      - 

      Select Minor version: Here it is enough to leave it in 1, however
      I have put the four annual versions in case there are changes
      (anything can happen).

      - 

      Select a revision: In this combo box leaving it at 0 is enough,
      however I have put up to 5 also just in case.

      If we tab we will fall in the button Apply changes to the
      manifests which will begin the process of modifying the manifests
      to those complements that we have selected in the list.

      If we tab again we will click on the Close button which will close
      the window without doing any action.

      Shortcut keys

      - Alt+L: It takes us quickly to the add-ins list.

      - Alt+S: Selects all the add-ons.

      - Alt+D: It deselects all the plug-ins that are marked.

      - Alt+A: It will start the modification of the manifests of those
      plug-ins that we have selected.

      - Alt+C or Escape: It will close the window without making any
      action.

      Author's comments

      Well NVDA is a reader in constant evolution for what many times
      there are complements that remain in the way for lack of
      development and for lack of adapting them to the changes that NVDA
      in its evolution brings.

      This means that changing the date in the manifests solves a
      momentary problem to be able to continue using those add-ons that
      are not updated or that the developer is slow to update them. But
      there will be add-ons that not only serves to change the manifest
      and need internal changes to adapt to new versions, in that case
      the add-on will break and only remains to contact the author of
      the add-on.

      I advise you to update the plugins that come out with the changes
      in the manifests even if we have changed the date with cricricri
      because it is possible that these plugins bring apart from the
      adaptation of the manifest other modifications that the developer
      has made.

      I am not responsible if something is broken by changing the
      manifests because there are hundreds of plugins and there may be
      some exceptions not contemplated by me.

      The use of this add-on and its results is solely under the
      responsibility of the end user.

      Cricricri is only valid for installed plugins.

      

      I plan to be able to choose one or more of a non-installed add-on
      and we can modify the manifest without unzipping the add-on and
      thus save steps.

      

      But at the moment I have a lot of work and for the moment I have
      not started with it.

2. Rename the add-on by changing the .nvda-addon extension to .zip.

3. Unzip it.

4. Change the manifest.

5. Re-zip it.

6. Rename it from .zip to .nvda-addon.

7. Install it.

In any case, it should all be working now once you download the latest version.

Code Factory did update the Eloquence-Vocalizer addon very shortly after 2022.1 was released. It is also possible to purchase a SAPI5 version of Vocalizer if users don’t want to deal with waiting for addon
 updates. While Code Factory used to sell a SAPI5 version of Eloquence I didn’t see it on their Web site when I last checked.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgI just took a look at 
Code Factory’s app store and I now see that Eloquence for Windows is available for purchase but Vocalizer for Windows is not. I apologize for the incorrect information that I wrote in my previous message.
This means that users who really like Eloquence and who want to be sure that it will always work with NVDA can purchase the Windows version. This gives you the added benefit of being able to test addon breaking releases and still continue
 to use Eloquence.

Error with New version of tesseractOCR add-on 6 messages,"Hello.

I have only just gotten around to trying this add-on. I am running the latest version of NVDA with Windows 10 21H2. My scanner works fine with other programs such as windows fax and scan and DocuScan. However when I try to scan a page from the scanner with this add-on, I receive the following error.

TesseractOCR  dialog  Scan error
Process wia-cmd-scanner failed:
Scanning to file C:\Users\Mobeen (dpi = 300, color mode 'GRAY', output format 'JPG')
Exception occured: Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED))

Please make sure your scanner is WIA-compliant and can scan in another application before trying again!
OK  button

I am then prompted if I want to scan another page. When I click no, the program keeps beeping with no way to cancel the process until NVDA is restarted. This is quite annoying. Is there any way around this error? Also in the next version, could you please consider adding a cancel keystroke or cancel button in a window? It would be a real shame if the only way of cancelling a scan job was to restart NVDA. As far as I know, I have all of the relevant drivers installed. It sounds like the add-on is not running with admin privileges or isn't able to save and process the image.

Very best wishes,

Mo.I don't know enough about this subject to be sure that what I am
    saying is correct but raising the questions may be of benefit.

    

    Is this add-on too limited?  Does it specify only WIA, or is that
    the result of how the scanner itself is already set up to
    communicate with the computer?  I wonder if the scanner doesn't work
    with the add-on because the scanner isn't set up to use WIA.

    

    GeneHi.
    I'm not sure what the issue could be, but when I try to use NAPS
      which is what this program is using in the background to scan
      directly to PDF, it seems to work fine. It also gives me 1 scanner
      choice. Surely these days we should be using twain as a standard?
    Very best wishes,
    Mo.for me also, it was not working yesterday and envision also failed to
recognise one tamil pdf.
I assumed the problem was with tesseract online engine itself. so used
i-stem for convertion yesterday using smsung phone.
Today, its working. ""--

Excel not speaking cell coordinates or content on startup or refocus 7 messages,"Hello.

I am running into a rather odd situation when I startup Excel

Or when I take focus away from it and minimize, then come back to it.


NVDA will say A1 selected, and then will not speak as I arrow around.

If I press alt to go into the ribbon menus, and then alt to exit them, then it will start speaking the cell's coordinates and content.


If I minimize and come back, again, NVDA will speak the cell at cursor with the selected term, and not speak on arrowing.

Same solution as above works.


I don't hear error sounds, and a quick look the log does not seem to indicate anything wrong in Excel either.

I have unchecked use UI automation for controls when available in Excel as a test.


I am using office 365 with the latest updates, and NVDA 2022.2, as well as 2022.3 beta.

The results are the same.


Thanks,

NVDA will say A1 selected, and then will not speak as I arrow around.I had something similar to this happening with Office 2019, about 18 months ago. I reported it in a Github issue, but it never got any love. In my case, the logs showed that the virtual buffer was crashing, and the alt trick caused it to be reinitialized. But switching apps would also fix it, which doesn't seem to be happening with you.

Have you tried NVDA with add-ons disabled?

Also, have you tried the COM Registration Fixing Tool in the NVDA tools menu?

LukeHi


I remember a fix but can not remember what version of excel it was but one was apparently if you went into excel then tried to arrow around say from a1 to other cells it would not say any thing.


Apparently if the scroll lock was on it would cause this problem


When turned off you could arrow around and hear what was in each cell. Maybe it was hit accidentally.


I did also about the same time see the other suggestion given but think it was for latest excel?



Let us know if it was the scroll lock causing the problem?


Gene nzUnfortunately it is not the scroll lock causing this.

Though I too have had that happen before.

The com registration tool did not fix this, though I seem to have this happening more randomly.

Have you tried running NVDA with add-ons disabled to see if that makes any difference?

At least doing so allows you to rule in/out a possible culprit.  I realize that you likely can't use NVDA sans add-ons as a permanent situation, but you can then systematically do a ""search and destroy"" mission to determine which add-on is causing the issue if it disappears when you run sans add-ons.

The difference between a top-flight creative man and the hack is his ability to express powerful meanings indirectly.
         ~ Vance PackardI have done so.
    I also ran a repair of office.
    Now, here is an interesting conundrum.
    I disabled add-ons, and one core voices not only has the issue,
      but also errors on focus to Excel.
    

    
    E-speak altogether does not seem to be having this issue in
      Excel.
    Tempted to just create a profile on focus to excel with E-speak
      and call it a day, but for the fact this is not going to solve the
      overall issue.

    D CJust a quick update:
    

    
    Under the this is going to be one of those weird cases which we
      never found a solution to because resolved itself, sort of...
    It seems after changing to E-speak, and then restarting NVDA with
      add-ons enabled again, and changing back to my default synth,
      things are for now at least behaving.
    I did run a prepare of Office 365, and also the com registration
      tool which I think I will get into the habit of doing so every few
      months just because I notice things are snappier where they were
      not before in other applications.
    

    
    Why the different synthesizer would make a difference is still a
      mystery to me.
    So, till somebody spins a theory, or comes up with an

Virus-free.www.avast.comI don't understand the issue here, I have had no problems answering
ranking questions in surveys. I have, however, had issues with radio
buttons not being reported correctly. If I'm tabbing through a form
with radio buttons, a lot of times it just reads the radio buttons
with no context as to what the radio button is for. My workaround for
this has been to use arrow keys instead. Is there something I'm
missing here?Hello, all, Somebody replied this evening saying that they answer ranking question frequently with no problem.

That was Bob Cavanaugh, in message  #98404.

This topic also accidentally got split, so I've merged it back together and fixed the typo in the title so ""ranking"" is now correct.  I will ask anyone who wishes to give Cearbhall example URLs to do so on this topic, which can be identified because ""ranking"" is in the title, not the original topic.  Otherwise, it will split again.

Gets even worse when some are tables and others not. I think there is a lot of education needed for form designers.

Facebook and Twitter shortcut keys compattibility with NVDA? 3 messages,"All,

Is there any way to use the facebook/Twitter shortcut keys for example ""J/K"" to scroll with NVDA without turning off the browse mode or single key shortcuts?

Any best practices to use Facebook and Twitter with NVDA?This should be on the chat subgroup, but...
You could also use ""pass next key through"" before every keypress (NVDA+F2). Honestly though the simplest solutions are either to use focus mode or turn off single letter navigation for that document (applies until refresh, I believe) (NVDA+Shift+Space).Hello,
Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, and many others are examples of web apps. Modal and non-modal screen readers work a bit differently, but they all have some sort of functionality for allowing you to pass keys to the web app, or to have keys perform screen reading functionality. in the case of NVDA, it seems that you already know your options. Use focus mode, or turn off virtual navigation keys. With some web apps, NVDA automatically goes into focus mode anyway. ""--

First question 15 messages,"Hello. I've been lurking on this list for a couple of months and have learned a lot. I have an immediate problem. My 10-year-old Toshiba laptop died a couple of days ago.


I want to buy an inexpensive laptop as an replacement, but nothing fancy, just Windows 10 or 11 with Thunderbird and MS Word and latest NVDA. Mostly, I use a laptop for a backup for my desktop PC and word processing.


In the past, I heard that JAWS and other screenreaders need lots of RAM, 8 GB or more. All the cheap laptops I'm looking at start at 4GB RAM. Is that enough for NVDA?


Any suggesstions on me buying a cheap backup laptop functional with NVDA will b very much appreciated.


Thanks. HarryHello,
Thanks for reaching out. 4 GB will work, but you ideally want at least 8, and adding an extra 4 GB really isn't all that costly.
As for different computer brands, as this is subjective and begins to stray from the topic of NVDA, I suggest you ask on a list dedicated to discussing such things, or on the chat subgroup.
Thanks. ""--

Thank you, and have a great day!""Make sure if you get something used, that it has a solidstate drive. I’m saying that mostly for the increased speed over a physical hard disc.Yup, love the SSD. Made the old desktop PC jump like a pup. HarryNVDA isn't the issue.  It doesn't take a lot of Ram and
    screen-reader's don't generally.  If you use the human sounding
    voices, I don't know how much RAM they take, but if you use
    Eloquence, the combination of the screen-reader and the synthesizer
    doesn't use much RAM.  

    There are lots of myths, widely promulgated about RAM.  You should
    have 8gb of RAM for Windows 10 or 11.  If all you are going to do is
    run one or two programs that aren't memory intensive, you might be
    able to get away with 4gb but RAM isn't expensive and it makes no
    sense to limit yourself in that way.  I have strongly disagreed with
    those who say, more or less that most people or almost everyone
    should have more than 8GB, but I do believe that a lot of people
    don't need more than 8GB but that that should be the minimum for the
    great majority of users.  

    

    I don't know how much you are willing to spend but it looks as
    though you are trying to get a budget laptop, the bottom of the
    line.  I don't see computer advisors recommending that people do
    that.

    

    But if you live in The United States and want to take a chance with
    about 200 dollars, getting a computer from Computers For the Blind
    might be something you want to gamble on.

    

    These are refurbished computers, mostly donated to the organization
    by businesses.  

    

    I can't say how reliable they are generally.  I've heard
    complaints.  I've also heard good things.  I got one and I am very
    satisfied with it.  

    

    But it may be a gamble and others may want to comment.

    

    Also, the organization doesn't say the battery included with the
    machine will be in good condition.  These are used machines and the
    batteries are not replaced.  They have to hold enough charge to
    operate the machine when it is plugged in but they are not stated to
    have enough power to run the machine for any period of time more
    than a brief one.  

    

    You said you want a backup for a desktop so that consideration may
    not matter.

    

    GeneThe original question said the person wants to use the computer as a
    backup for a desktop and he discussed using programs where the extra
    speed offered by an SSD doesn't matter.  If you are going to be
    working on a Word document, if it takes one or two more seconds to
    load the document and an extra second to save the document once you
    have finished working on it, that amount of time saving doesn't
    justify getting an SSD.  

    

    Having said that, computers from Computers For the Blind come with
    SSDs.  

    

    This is my last message in the thread on the main NVDA list.  Since
    the first question asks about the amount of RAM NVDA uses, I'm not
    sure if it was appropriate for the main list, but further discussion
    on the main list isn't since, aside from the RAM question, the
    discussion has nothing to do with NVDA. 

    

    GeneWe often get asked about computers, and like everyone has said here, more RAM helps, but NVDA should run on basically anything you can get your hands on - except Windows 10 S, stay away from that.
What I normally recommend looking at is what keyboard layout do you want?  Do you want a number pad, or do you prefer a smaller form factor without one?   What will you use as your NVDA key, and if Insert, check where it is on that keyboard.  Also, see if you can check the quality of the inbuilt speaker - even if you plan to use headphones or external speakers mostly, it's still handy and sometimes unavoidable using the build in speakers occasionally (and if they're that good, you might not need external speakers - but the last thing you want is to count on using the inbuilt speaker and then discover that it's unbearable to you).
The other personal comment I'd make is, both in general and in regards to a specific model line - don't buy the very cheapest available, but at the same time, don't pay heaps extra to buy the very newest processor.  Work out what your budget is and try to get something good quality in that range.  Models and brands vary - just because someone you know had a bad experience with Lenovo, doesn't make them all bad - similarly, just because your last Acer was brilliant, judge the next one on its own merits - companies change a lot in five years (and that isn't a comment for or against, Acer, Lenovo or any other brand).

    If you are going to use the laptop in such a way that you don't care
    if you use the internal keyboard or not, you don't have to worry
    about it.  I use my Windows 10 laptop with an external keyboard and
    I never intend to use it with its internal keyboard.

    

    Gene8 gig will work fine, 16 is good.
Anything more than 16  gig of ram is a waste of money  unless you are doing audio/video editing.Isn't it worth also looking about the processor?
If a 2.4Ghz would do a lot rather than anything like a 1.5Ghz.
But I'm afraid about the cost of it.
Still, it is always better to look for the best option near to our budget, and if there is anything better to lift it for little more considering the long time use.
Because machines tent to slow down when time passes. And it will be a real pain at that time.
Cheers,
V.S.Ravindran.
Excuses leads to failure!””Depending on how you use a computer, you may just be wasting money
    if you buy a faster processor.  Also, machines don't tend to slow
    down just because they do.  It may be that over time, if you do
    certain things, your Windows may slow down and you may want to put
    on a clean copy or revert to a backup, but that is not inevitable. 
    I use machines for years and they don't slow down.

    

    Many people spend more money, sometimes quite a bit more than they
    need to and get little or no benefit.

    

    GeneThis is again based on your needs. I currently use an HP ENVY Laptop to do all my works including Audio editing, and that machine had served me quite well for almost three years. Is far I know, only Jaws need massive amounts of storage because they came with so many drivers once you install the screen reader.  NVDA is a lightweight screen reader, and you can download all the add-ins if you want to better enhance your user experience. That is all I have to say, and I hope what I said is valid. . Thanks Best regards Michael H. MunnIf you buy a new windows pc today, it will likely   have windows 11 installed   and the processor will likely be running at 3.0 ghz  or higher.My machine is 5 years old, or rather was, I’ll say this much. It got so slow that even a reinstall didn’t fix the issue. So yes, parts do ware out. Be aware of this.  I would go with 3.4ghz and 8 gigs of ram if all you will do is check email; future proof yourself though as what if one day that program you use to check email becomes more processer intensive as I’ve seen over the years. You will feel it as time goes by. Even nvda will over time due to what ever we do with it will become more processer intensive. That’s just my take on things.This topic is locked after this post, as speccing out a computer is not NVDA specific.  If further conversation is desired a new topic, with a descriptive title, should be created on the Chat Subgroup.

Gene is correct that many people spend way more money than they need to based on what they intend to use a computer for.

As someone who is an IT support professional, I will always say the two most important things you can spend money on as far as any computer goes is RAM capacity and an SSD, and the less RAM you have the more important an SSD becomes in supporting responsiveness.

Minimum specs are not now, and have never been, optimum specs for ""happy campers.""  The minimum RAM I would consider for Windows 10 or 11 is 8GB.  Since Windows 10 only has 3 more years of support, I would verify that the processor in any machine you're considering can support Windows 11 even if it doesn't happen to come with it.  For all Intel i-series processors, that means 8th generation or newer, which is indicated by a number higher than 8000 after the hyphen, e.g., i5-8790.

Very few users indeed, particularly casual users doing web browsing, emailing, and using office suites as their primary activities have ever even come close to exploiting all the processing power of modern processors.

If you're trying to economize, it is always worth looking at manufacturer refurbished business class machines.  They're of higher build quality and generally have specifications that are more than adequate for most home users.

Now lets move this to the Chat Subgroup if anyone wishes to discuss this further.

Focus issues with Google's Enhanced protection browsing mode 6 messages,"Hi all,

I recently turned on Enhanced Protection for browsing which can be found under chrome's settings in the Privacy and Security tab.

Unfortunately for screen reader users, this mode doesn't only tell you about safety breaches, but also about all the safe URLs. I haven't experimented with it that much yet, but on a google search results page, if you arrow down from a given search result heading, after you get to ""About this result"", the notification about the URLs safe status steels focus and puts the cursor at the top of the page.

This obviously is a nuisance, and I'm not quite sure what the best solution is for now which is why I'm writing here. In an ideal world, it would be possible to set Chrome to only tell you about safety issues and leave you alone as long as all is well but still have enhanced protection turned on. Short of that, it's not super obvious what to do as presumably if you remove focus from the safe website announcements, you're also going to miss problem alerts. Any ideas? 

Thanks,

ÁineI may play with it.  But since there is a problem, one question is
    whether it gives you enough additional protection to have it on
    since it causes a problem.  I don't know how you use web sites but I
    doubt it does.  If you compare the description of what enhanced
    browsing does with what standard safety does, I doubt it matters
    much if someone is careful and checks things if concerned.  For
    example, just downloading an unsafe file won't cause you to become
    infected.  If you don't run it, nothing will happen.  If you have
    good anti malware protection, you probably are getting little extra
    protection.  Standard safety browsing already tells you about
    dangerous sites.

    

    Here is a web page where you can compare the two:

https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid

    

    Also, depending on the size of the download, you can send it to a
    site named Virus Total, where it is analyzed by a lot of antimalware
    programs and you get a report about the findings.  You would
    download the file, then send it there.  

    

    GeneI just checked.  It appears enhanced protection is on by default. 
    It is on my browser and I don't recall changing it.  But I don't
    have the problem you are having.  What screen-reader are you using?

    

    GeneI just checked.  On one machine, a Windows 7 machine, enhanced
    protection is on and on another, a Windows 10 machine, standard
    protection is on.  I don't know if I changed the setting on my
    Windows 7 machine a good while ago and don't remember or not.  But
    it appears that standard protection is the default.

    

    On both machines, using both JAWS and NVDA with enhanced protection
    on, I don't have the problem you are having and I don't get all
    sorts of messages about sites when looking through results.  I don't
    know what accounts for what you are experiencing.

    

    GeneSorry this is totally my mistake thanks Gene. I had toggled the browsing setting the other day so mistakenly thought it was the source of the issue, but in fact the culprit is a McAfee Web advisor Chrome extension, which I must have managed to accidently enable at some point. Now disabled!Its good you found the problem.

Focus problems with google chrome and microsoft edge 16 messages,"Hi,
Do any of you have a problem with focus in google chrome or microsoft edge?
 
Thanks,
Afik
 

 
Get Outlook for iOSI don't have such problems but your question could be better
    discussed if we have a specific example or examples of the problems
    you are having.

    

    Also, you mentioned two browsers.  Do you have the same problems
    with a browser that isn't a Chrome-based browser such as Firefox?

    

    GeneNo, firefox is ok .
The problem, for example i’m on a website, and the focus jump to the end of the website. Its happends every few seconds.









Get Outlook for iOSI don't know what causes the problem.  Does it happen with another
    screen-reader?  This doesn't sound to me as though it has anything
    to do with NVDA.  

    

    GeneYes, its happends with Jaws on 2 laptops with different operating systems. 
Really effect my daily work. Its happend on every website.






Get Outlook for iOSI don't want to say it is but it may be malware.  If you do the same
    things on both computers and go to the same sites, it may be that
    you got the same malware.

    

    GeneAnd I see no indication that The Most Basic Troubleshooting Steps for Suspected NVDA Issues
have been tried.  This could very well be add-on related, among other things, and if it is add-on related and the same add-ons are in use on both machines . . .

I see that now, but just glided over the ""JAWS"" part the first time I read it.

I absolutely agree that if you're getting the exact same result with the same website, with two different screen readers, and on two different systems the probability that the issue lies with the screen reader is almost certainly zero.  And if it's not happening in Firefox with the same screen readers in use for the same site and actions, that's a very strong indication that something's wrong with the other web browser in use when it does happen.

Troubleshooting is a methodical process of elimination by changing out possible factors, one at a time, and seeing when a problem goes away and/or comes back.

And?  If it's happening with either JAWS or NVDA, the probability that it's screen-reader related is almost zero.

I have said it many times before, and will say it again:  The vast majority of problems are idiosyncratic to a single computer, or several computers if either the same infection occurs on all, or if browser sync functions are propagating some issue.  They're not global.

Note that no one else has confirmed any behavior similar to that which you're having.  That should tell you something - they're not because it's something specific to your systems.  And when others cannot replicate an issue they can seldom assist very much in fixing it.

It's not that I don't feel your pain, but you need to turn to local resources that are more likely to be able to assist you.  If you have not run an offline scan with Windows Security, you should also do that on all systems having the issue you're having.  I agree with Gene that there are many hallmarks that suggest an infection of some sort.

         ~ Vance PackardFor the record, some pages have some kind of updated content at some point in the page. It does seem that Edge is more prone to jump to such places

I could try turning off the new content switch, but  the last time I saw it was on a yahoo page, but never remember things like addresses, sorry. Using Firefox or waterfox  you don't get any of that nonsense.

in the display name field.No its definitely a web site or site config issue in my opinion. I also do not feel its malware as such, since from my point of view many  malware and anti virus scanners say I'm clear, so it has to be interaction between web sites and browser, maybe its as easy as tweaking a few settings.
As Brian says, you really need to be methodical if this is a serious issue stopping you from working.
Try one thing at a time. Its already clear that the browser makes a difference, and only Chrome based browsers are affected, so far so good. Get a sighted person in to see what the screen is actually doing if you can and if its different. For example sometimes inline adverts can cause this, but that may well be fixable in the browsers advert blocking policies or add ons. Like I say, I tend only to use Edge when circumstances must, but prefer Mozilla based browsers for consistency of behaviour.

Even though the issue is now reported as fixed, I want to emphasize how right you are.  And even more so that it would not happen across multiple browsers on multiple machines.

The fact that the solution came in updating to a beta (which the fact that it's a beta is not the fix in and of itself) points out that the old tech trick of uninstall and reinstall when you have really bizarre issues is a go-to method as well.  Uninstalling 2022.2 and then reinstalling 2022.2 would have been every bit as likely to get the same result as installing 2022.3 beta 1 has.  It's still an ""out with the old and bad, in with the new (or renewed)"" form of fix.

Forgive this q. about end-block-quote and paragraph Editable 7 messages,"Can I write emails without having these words come up?  I know it must be possible; and I know that I should be able to figure out what it is that I need to turn off.

Is there a way to get this extraneous wording out of the reading and writing process?

Sorry if this should be obvious.

Thanks.NVDA announces block quotes by default, a setting I have objected to
    in the past.

    

    You can eliminate this announcement in the following way:

    Open the document formatting dialog using the command control NVDA
    d.  That is, hold control and the NVDA key and type d while doing
    so.

    Tab through the items and you will eventually get to block quotes. 
    It is a check box.  Uncheck it with the space bar, then press
    enter.  

    

    You won't hear block quotes identified in places like e-mails or web
    pages.  

    

    GeneThanks so much.  I don't care what default is, if only I can
      change it.  

    
    Thanks so much for the info.
    PenIf I recall, that dialogue also has the check box for table
      column and row header information. On some older websites that use
      tables for formatting instead of CSS, turning that off may also be
      useful. I know it's off topic, but it took me a while to find how
      to turn it off.
    

    
    - CarlosThose settings aren't related as you are describing.  There is a
    specific field for tables used for formatting.  It is off by
    default.  Format tables aren't announced.  If you want to turn off
    announcement  of table heading and row column information, those are
    settings that affect what is announced in those areas concerning
    tables in general.

    

    You can experiment with different settings and see what settings you
    like better but you won't hear formatting table information
    announced if you are using default settings.

Frequently Unable to Press Elements On The Web 9 messages,"Dear all,

I am using NVDA, Firefox, and Edge (latest stable versions of each but
I have been facing such issues for many months now). Far too
frequently have I been encountering instances wherein Spacebar/Enter
simply does not activate a pressable item (link, button, menu item,
dialog, etc.). Either nothing happens, or the focus jumps in the page
arbitrarily, or a different element in the page is activated, or I am
thrown into another window altogether. This happens on commonplace
websites like Google, LinkedIn, and Doordash as well as less complex
and lesser-known websites. In these cases, I sometimes need to enter
focus mode and retry Spacebar/Enter, sometimes need to manually move
around the navigator object to the control and press
NVDA+Shift+Backspace and then NVDA+Enter, sometimes manually
reposition the navigator object and move the mouse pointer to it and
then simulate a left mouse click, and sometimes try maximizing the
browser's window or closing some other programs whose window may be
interfering (like CCleaner and Google Drive). Even then, sometimes,
none of these strategies succeed. This experience applies to a
minority of pressable elements (<50%), but it is a significant
minority of cases and enough to be a significant inconvenience. I face
this more often in Firefox, but that might be because I use it more
than I do Edge.

I would like to acknowledge that (a) the description of my issue lacks
examples and is somewhat generic, and (b) issues should ideally be
reported on GitHub. This is intentional because in my experience, this
problem is pervasive and issues of this kind have already been
reported on GitHub for months(/years?) to little effect.

Do you face such issues as well? What strategies do you use when
Spacebar/Enter doesn't activate a control like it should? Have you
found one web browser to fare better than another in this respect (say
Edge might be more reliable than Firefox)?

I would be deeply grateful for any thoughts and suggestions.

In fact the thing was off screen when I went into document mode to be sure the page had actually changed, or not changed.  Chrome did something worse where the thing would not even activate when I typed in my query on trailhead’s salesforce settings when creating a permission set. I had to go through the whole interface to find where  the thing was I had to modify. I then had an add button that would not become active. No, alt tabbing did not work. It took me 3 days to get this assignment done because of that little hiccup. I did get it done but with much hair pulling.In my view, this is the web site. I know not enough about page authoring but it seems to me that its normally repeatable on the same objects on the same pages. Indeed on one in the Google email settings it threw me completely out to the desktop and when I found the browser again, it had gone to an earlier page.
Its very hard to judge exactly why, but because there are more than one issues here, it could be that its just too complex to resolve. Dunno.

Regards, Abhishek Raut""This does sound like a website layout issue, though I wonder if the
original poster has something else going on? The original message
indicates this happens frequently, which isn't my experience. I was
trying to buy tickets for an event on Eventbright the other day and
encountered a dialog that I couldn't seem to close, but as it was the
purchase dialog, it wasn't an issue. So, a couple questions for the
original poster of this question:
1. Does the issue happen on the same sites every time, or is it the
case that you can go to a site one day and it works and another day
where it doesn't?
2. Can you provide us some links? Without this information, we can't
tell if there's something wrong with your computer or if you just have
a habit of visiting less than accessible websites. It sounds like my
experience meerrors most on this list, where the occasional website
has issues, but most sites work fine. When you say Google for

    in form.  My question is why forms are being asked about.  I seldom
    stop at such forms because ways of moving such as move by heading
    from the top of a page to the beginning of an article, using the
    letter h, or skipping blocks of links, using the letter n, moves me
    beyond such forms on web pages.  So how are you V.S. moving to get
    from the tops of pages to where you want to be?

That's not a form, plain and simple.

The ""single question per page"" questionnaire format has been with us for decades, but it's not a form in any meaningful sense of the term.

The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.
        ~ Dorothy NevillThe problem is that a lot of places use this  format for things like creating an account, to me this ought to be done on one page, since it makes it easier to spot any cock ups.
 At other times  creating an account just appears to be a big questionnaire, ie they gather as much info about you and your opinions as you are willing to give during the creation process , so  the description often is blurred, and these sort of creation pages mean you have no idea what you will be asked or if you will fail  at the final visual capchar option at the end as you cannot see it first.
Sorry, but that is one of my trigger points grin.

Google Drive Stop Sharing a File 2 messages,"I can mostly get around Google Drive with NVDA without too much difficulty. However, I would like to revoke sharing privileges to a certain user. I found these directions but they don't seem to work with NVDA. Any of you have a workaround?
Stop, limit, or change sharing - Computer - Google Drive Help
ThanksI haven't used Google Drive but I was curious and played around.  I
    didn't take notes but the following may give you enough information
    to allow you to do what you want.  If my instructions aren't quite
    right, since you already know how to share files, the following may
    give you enough information to remove a name.

    

    If you know how to find the name of the person you don't want to
    share with any longer, find it, turn off browse mode, open the
    context menu, and up and down arrow until you find share.  Press
    enter.

    Look around.  Stay in focus mode and you will see something like a
    combo box where you will see names of those who can share the file. 
    You should hear something like remove and the name.  When you have
    up or down arrowed to the name you want to stop sharing with, press
    delete.

    

    Since I played around and didn't take notes, my description may not
    be quite correct but if you already know enough to share files, you
    can probably figure out what to do based on what I wrote to remove
    someone.

A banner message reading, ""Note: groups.io will be down for maintenance this evening, starting at 9pm Pacific Time (4AM Saturday July 30, 2022 UTC), for approximately 15 minutes,"" has been posted on the web interface starting a few hours ago.  Even though that outage is going to be short, I thought the membership should know about it.  I would imagine messages sent during a scheduled outage will bounce back to the sender.

The difference between a top-flight creative man and the hack is his ability to express powerful meanings indirectly.
         ~ Vance PackardThank you very much, Brian for the heads up. I appreciate it.  I was not aware of that.Members don't get such messages.  

    

    I believe it was last night that Groups.io was down for a short
    time.  When I sent messages during that time, I got a failure
    delivery notice and part of the notice said the group didn't exist. 
    This may confuse some members.  Evidently, the mail system itself,
    when it can't find an active address to deliver to sends a message
    that the group doesn't exist.

    

    GeneThanks to all for confirming that these messages do not go out by email and that having this information is useful.

Whenever such a notification banner is appearing in the web interface in the future I will make a post similar to this one so that the membership is aware.

How does NVDA process the Tab key in browse mode?,"I’m in the process of designing a course on web accessibility from a screen reader perspective. After using almost every screen reader that has ever existed since the late 80s, I thought I had a good handle on how they worked until now.
I’m flummoxed as to how NVDA (and JAWS and Narrator) is able to synchronize the Tab key in browse mode, such that if the virtual focus is within a normally non-focusable object like a paragraph, system focus moves to the nearest tab-focusable object relative to the virtual caret, rather than relative to the last synchronized browser focus. I can’t tell if and in what manner NVDA is intercepting the Tab key.
For example, assume the following code:element 1: <button>Hit me</button>Element 2: <p>I’m only focusable in browse mode</p>Element 3: <a href=“http://knowbility.org”>These are the folks I’m designing the course for</a>Element 4: <p>I’m some more text</p>
NVDA behavior: arrowing down from Element 1 to element 4 then pressing Shift-Tab moves focus to element 3, as God intended.
VoiceOver behavior in Safari (an often reliable case for something broken): arrowing from Element 1 to Element 4, then pressing Shift+Tab, moves focus to Element 1, because Element 3 was the last system focus.
I don’t know of any way for the screen reader to send an action to the accessibility API that sets a “here I am” pointer to an object that can’t receive keyboard focus in the absence of a screen reader.
I ran into this puzzle when I realized that web pages can script the Tab key. In the <dialog> element or role=“dialog”, JavaScript can capture the Tab key and make it wrap within the dialog. To me, this implies that screen readers (any of them) are not intercepting the Tab key. Yet, they have to also set keyboard focus relative to the browse mode position when the Tab key is pressed, which requires some sort of processing.
I’m sure the answer is something simple, and I’m overthinking it. But Every possibility I can overthink of wouldn’t work in either the above code example or in a tab ring scripted for a modal.

Konu: [nvda] How to download the latest ffmpeg for windows Using nvda 22.x and Windows 11 21H2 (x64) build 22000.795. I have this issue in Firefox, chrome, edge.  Launch http://www.ffmpeg.orgClick downloadThere should be a windows link then a link to the essentials and / or other EXE binaries. Here’s the problem. There is not one. I see an unlabeled link I found to be windows; however, I cannot find the links I need. They used to be there in November last year when I had to do this, however something in the site’s \code changed. A bit of help as I really do think something broke. I just need someone else to verify this. I watched a YouTube video that said how to do this, except I cannot find any of the links mentioned.  Sorry if this comes out a bit odd, I’m having keyboard getting stuck issues as I’m running out of memory on this system, again.I don't know just what you are looking for.  Using Firefox, I find,
    quite a way down the page, links that say these things:

    Download FFmpeg 

     Download Source Code 

    ffmpeg-snapshot.tar.bz2

        Download PGP Signing Key 

    ffmpeg-devel.asc

    

    Do any of those links do what you want?

    

    GeneAlso, I looked at a lot of the page after I followed the download
    link but I found no Windows link.  

    

    GeneHello, the official ffmpeg site has not been building binaries
      for Windows for a long time.

      

      In fact, it refers to other pages to get the binaries.

      

      I leave the one I use.

      

      https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

      

      GreetingsNo, it does not help.  I see the same page with the Linux snaps etc. no windows binaries or zip files containing dll like I saw last year.  Believe me I’ve been trying to download these for months from the ffmpeg.org website and getting nowhere.No those are for the Linux stuff, I downloaded and looked at those. None of those are for windows.Yes exactly. It used to be there.  Yet according to the video you are supposed to hover over the windows link and get the files. I even tried clicking and using document view to look at the page. No joy’s. you are seeing the same thing I’m seeing then.Hmm, look at the video, that was as of last year. Is this out of date now? Even the  reaper wiki written this year points to the ffmpeg.org to download the  windows  version of ffmpeg esentials. I’m not sure when the video was done, it was some time last year or early this year.Hello.

      

      This is what it says on the official site:

      

      Get packages & executable files

      FFmpeg only provides source code. Below are some links that
      provide it already compiled and ready

      

      And the links that are supposed to direct to external sites that
      do provide the binaries do not open.

      

      So, as I said, this has been the case for a long time and they
      stopped officially building binaries for Windows.

      

      Either you build it yourself from the source code or use for
      example the page I shared that generates the binaries from the
      same ffmpeg repository.

      

      Regards.Wow looks like then the ffmpeg site is indeed broken in terms of the links that are supposed to redirect you. If you look at the YouTube video, he did get it to work, but I wonder how, maybe it truly is a hover, if it is that will not work for us.I was able to get it to work. Unfortunately, the links that switch between displaying Linux, Windows and MacOS links are not labelled, nor keyboard accessible. If I tab between said links in focus mode, then route the mouse pointer to the navigator object (I have navigator follows focus on), the links below changed appropriately for me. Windows is the second of three unlabelled links.Wow, ok, so you can see the other items he talks about. Ok then, hmm interesting. I got what I needed from there other place; I just hope that side does not go down like one of the sites linked to in an earlier video this guy did.I looked at the page.  I looked using Firefox and I haven't checked
    with other browsers.I don’t think I’m using an add blocker on chrome, I can’t’ remember. I’m not the only one with this issue, however. You are right the page needs a lot of accessibility work, it is not one of the easiest pagesw to use. Oh well.I was responding to the message below mine.  that was from another
    member describing what he found on the site.  

    

    GeneHello as I said the official site does not provide binaries for
      Windows.

      

      From its official page it refers to these two pages once we choose
      the second link:

      

      Windows EXE Files

      Windows builds from gyan.dev

      Windows builds by BtbN

      

      

      The first is the one I passed yesterday that I think is the best
      because it has even api to check versions and their binaries are
      copiled from the same repo of ffmpeg and an advantage over the
      second has 32-bit binaries:

      

      https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/

      

      The second site where it says we can download binaries is the
      following repository:

      

      https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases

      It does not give more alternatives.

      

      I still recommend the first option as it gives us the possibility
      to download also 32-bit and is updated daily.

      

      Greetings.Wow, how did you get those sites from the page? Nothing happens when I click the second unlabeled link. That page is over all a mess as far as accessibility is concerned IMHO.Looks like they are diving into linux all the way.
    Even the archived links don't show a windows option.I explained yesterday that having JAVA scripts off will cause the
    proper page or the proper part of the page to pop up.  The rest of
    the page will still be there and if you aren't on the right part,
    you have to look for it but somewhere on the page, you will find
    text about Windows files.

How to fill fillable PDF forms with NVDA 16 messages,"Hi friendsHow do I fill out fillable pdf forms with NVDA? 
ThanksHave you tried Adobe Acrobat DC?Is it accessible with NVDA? I know that it is accessible to read pdf files. I don't know that it is accessible to fill out forms though. I am using the free version of Adobe reader.Why not try it? You may need to pop in and out of browse mode as you go.I use adobe reader to do it, if the form is accessible, it will work quite well. The only thing I do is sign in print after I print the form.On Wed, Aug 3, 2022 at 09:16 AM, Chris Smart wrote:

Adobe Reader DC definitely supports the filling out of fillable PDF forms, and the saving of ones that permit you to save them once they're filled out.  Yes, there are fillable forms that do not allow you to save them and the process there is to fill them out then print the filled-out result.  They're less rare than you'd think.

Every fillable form I've ever dealt with, be it PDF or MS-Word, just involves traversing the form fields (including checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.) using TAB to move from item to item and doing whatever is appropriate for the particular item to fill it out.  A properly designed fillable form should announce the name/purpose of the item when you land in it and, if necessary, have associated help text if the name/purpose is not descriptive enough on its own.

         ~ Vance PackardIf the form is accessibly created, it will be accessible in word, if not, you will need sighted help and for that I recommend aira and pdf escape.If the .pdf is editable you can use Adobe, or Foxit PDF Reader.I just filled out an IRS document with no problems. 73 N2DYN AngeloOn Wed, Aug 3, 2022 at 10:48 AM, Sarah k Alawami wrote:

I have literally never encountered a fillable PDF form that worked when opened in MS-Word.  If you have an example of such, I'd appreciate your sending it to me to play with.

The way fillable forms, whether PDF or native Word, are engineered makes any conversion of same to another file format such that the fillable aspect is no more.

         ~ Vance PackardI don’t have one now, I do; however, I’m not allowed to send it anywhere due to an NDA. I filled it out in word, and it worked fine. The form was not accessible in adobe, at all. The person accepted it without any issues.  I get the feeling I’ve written this before.I'm assuming you're using Adobe Reader? We had an extensive discussion
about this a couple months ago, and the solution ended up being that
you have to force focus mode in order to make the fields work
properly.On Wed, Aug 3, 2022 at 01:04 PM, Sarah k Alawami wrote:

Sarah,

What was it's extension?   The probability that a fillable PDF form, with a PDF extension, would be accessible in Word and not in Acrobat (whether reader or full Acrobat) is pretty much zero.

There are, of course, fillable Word forms, and I've written about those at length before.  The DOTX extension indicates an actual form (whether fillable or not) that, when activated, will create an instance of the form that you later save.  It's possible to mail out such a form, after creation, that will have the DOCX extension.

         ~ Vance PackardNo, it was pdf, but the text was not written in form fields. It was just written: name:Date:Address: Something like that. There were no form fields. You had to write the answers with a virtual pen. Many of us have done this in edge, inaccessibly of course.  So, I opened the form in word, it converted it, I filled all of it out, then saved it back into pdf, making sure the accessibility box was ticked to render tags properly as I had put some in there to show off a portfolio I was at the time working on. Again I’m not aloud to show the form as I could get into very big trouble, hopefully my explanation is clear enough.On Wed, Aug 3, 2022 at 02:03 PM, Sarah k Alawami wrote:

And that's not a fillable form.  It's just a form, like a paper form, that allows you to fill it out with a virtual pen rather than printing it on paper and using a real pen.

And I'm not trying to be difficult or split-hairs, but ""in the IT business"" a fillable form is one that has form fields, checkboxes, etc., that can be traversed either by keyboard methods (Tabbing) or point and click and where you can type in edit boxes and do what's appropriate for checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.

Taking a paper form and typing it in a word processor, Acrobat, etc., but where the end result is simply an electronic version of the paper form is not considered to be a fillable form as the terminology has been used for as long as I've been in the IT business (and that's since 1985).  The electronic pen is a relatively new invention, but the fact that you can fill-in (non-accessibly) via the screen in a way that's exactly analogous to a paper form does not a ""fillable form"" make, at least not in the commonly construed way.  If that were considered to be a fillable form then a paper form should be considered ""a fillable form,"" and it is not.

Fillable forms, although they can be fabulous accessibility tools, were not originally created with that express purpose in mind.  It was to allow you to fill them out entirely on a computer that had nothing but a keyboard (and mouse, for mouse users) and either save it once filled out or print it once it's filled out.  If you can't/couldn't do that it was simply a form that was to be printed and filled out by hand.  And heaven knows how many documents (regardless of file format) exist where that's exactly how they're set up and intended to be used.

And even more key is making the distinction between a fillable form and a paper form that happens to have been typed out in the format to allow printing in Word, Acrobat, or similar.

While there are some fillable forms that are actually crap because the necessary information to make the items accessible is not included, that's an issue of its own.

But calling an electronic equivalent of a paper form a ""fillable form"" muddies the water so badly.  That's not a fillable form as the term has been used for a very, very long time.  The fact that you can fill out a form with pen on paper or electronic pen on screen does not make it a fillable form.  A fillable form is something else entirely.

"IMPORTANT Notice on Joseph Lee's add-ons: reducing/ending support for Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and unsupported Windows 10 feature updates effective january 2023 2 messages","Hello NVDA community,Before I get into the heart of this announcement, I’m delighted to announce that all my add-ons are compatible with NVDA 2022.2 changes. And yes, I’m back – thank you everyone for your valuable feedback, comments, and criticisms – I still have some residue from NVDA 2022.1 and add-ons work but feeling a bit better after taking a break for a while.The following notice is applicable to anyone using my add-ons (Ad-on Updater, Windows App Essentials, future add-ons and/or add-ons awaiting new maintainers), specifically for anyone using Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and their server counterparts. Please do NOT take this as a statement on NVDA and support for Windows releases (for that one, see a message from Quentin from NV Access posted earlier this year):Earlier this year I (Joseph Lee) announced that my add-ons will eventually end support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, noting that I will provide a 60-day notice before then. I then sent a notice in March 2022, stating that add-ons, including ones leaving my maintenance (which there were five then) will end support for Windows 7 and 8.x effective May 2022; I also noted that there will be an exception, namely Add-on Updater which will support old Windows releases as long as NVDA supports them. On paper, end of support date was May 7, 2022 but due to various community events (namely preparing for NVDA 2022.1), I forgot to announce that fact.My original plan was and still is to see if anyone from the NVDA community can take care of now unmaintained add-ons from me (Enhanced Touch Gestures, Event Tracker, GoldWave, Resource Monitor, Sound Splitter, StationPlaylist) with a possibility that new maintainers will release a version of these add-ons requiring Windows 10 or later eventually (source code is ready). However, since I haven’t received messages about new maintainers (as of time of this announcement), I am revising the plan as follows:Effective January 2023, all of my add-ons with limited exceptions will no longer support unsupported or soon to be unsupported Windows releases, including Windows 7/Server 2008 R2, Windows 8/Server 2012, Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2, and unsupported feature updates for Windows 10 and later from the standpoint of consumers and businesses. For Windows 10, unsupported feature updates are 1507 (build 10240), 1511 (build 10586/November Update), 1607 (build 14393/Anniversary Update), 1703 (build 15063/Creators Update), 1709 (build 16299/Fall Creators Update), 1803 (build 17134/April 2018 Update), 1809 (build 17763/October 2018 Update), 1903 (build 18362/May 2019 Update), 1909 (build 18363/November 2019 Update), 2004 (build 19041/May 2020 Update), and from December 2022 onwards, 21H1 (build 19043/May 2021 Update); although consumer support for 20H2 (build 19042/October 2020 Update) ended in May 2022, business support ends in May 2023, thus it is still a supported Windows 10 feature update. The list of supported and unsupported Windows releases can change based on Windows product lifecycle schedule. This policy applies to current and future add-ons, and if circumstances warrant it, any add-ons I have maintained in the past that are not being maintained by the community as of January 2023 (see notes).Notes:The only exception will be Add-on Updater which will have reduced functionality on unsupported Windows releases so that it can provide a “nightlight” (minimal service for emergency and special uses) and to keep my promise of supporting old Windows releases as long as NVDA itself supports them. That is, even though updates for Ad-on Updater will be compatible with unsupported releases, new features will be exclusive to supported Windows releases; for users of older Windows releases, consider this a “feature freeze” notice. As for what constitutes nightlight functionality, I expect that you will be able to at least check for, download, and install add-on updates and tell Add-on Updater to not check for some add-on updates; details will be communicated soon. One thing is certain: unless things change, Add-on Updater will continue to work on unsupported Windows releases but remember that you will be on your own due to security risks associated with downloading data from the Internet; PROCEED WITH CAUTION!Windows App Essentials supports Windows 10 and 11 feature updates that are actively supported for consumers (as of time of this writing, Windows 10 Version 21H1, 21H2 (build 19044/November 2021 Update), Windows Server 2022 (build 20348), Windows 11 Version 21H2 (build 22000)), with the add-on ending support for a given feature update prior to end of consumer support from Microsoft (for example, Windows App Essentials will end support for Windows 10 Version 21H1 by September 2022, three months prior to Microsoft ending support for it (December), and support for Windows 10 Version 21H2 from the add-on is scheduled to end in early 2023 prior to end of consumer-level support in June 2023).The following add-ons are no longer (actively) maintained by me as of time of this post: Enhanced Touch Gestures, Event Tracker, GoldWave, Resource Monitor, Sound Splitter, StationPlaylist. If no-one volunteers to maintain them by January 2023, the unsupported Windows release policy will apply to them as well – that is, a version of these add-ons will be released that will not install on unsupported Windows releases. Frequently asked questions: Q. Does this mean NVDA itself will end support for unsupported Windows releases?No. NV Access noted that NVDA will support Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and other old releases. Q. What about add-ons such as Control Usage Assistant?Add-ons such as Control Usage Assistant (formerly maintained by me) have new maintainers, therefore this policy notice does not apply to them. Q. Can I modify future add-on releases for use on unsupported Windows releases?Yes and no. Yes you can view and modify add-ons so they can work on unsupported releases. At the same time, for some add-ons, supporting legacy Windows releases will require extensive edits to the add-on source code as legacy Windows code were removed for some add-ons in March 2022. Q. Why is using Add-on Updater on unsupported Windows releases a potential security risk?At its core, Add-on Updater downloads data from the Internet. Therefore, it might be possible that add-on hosting repositories can be compromised, leading to distribution of malicious add-ons. The add-ons community takes add-on security seriously, particularly when it comes to distribution channels. Q. Does this mean future add-ons from Joseph will not support old Windows releases?Yes. While the policy takes full effect in January 2023, you can assume that new add-ons I (Joseph Lee) may publish in 2022 will require Windows 10 Version 21H1 or later. Q. Do you have plans to release updates for unmaintained add-ons prior to the policy taking effect in January 2023?For Enhanced Touch Gestures, Event Tracker, GoldWave, Resource Monitor, Sound Splitter, and StationPlaylist, I have no plans to release updates in 2022; rather, releasing updates is close to impossible as these add-ons no longer support old Windows releases at the source code level. Q. Wait, the just announced policy sounds similar to the feature update support policy for Windows App Essentials add-on.In some ways, yes. The difference is that Windows App Essentials support Windows 10 and later whereas other add-ons support old Windows releases such as Windows 7. Q. Why January 2023?This is when support for Windows 7 and 8.1 will end for most users (extended security updates for Windows 7, extended support for Windows 8.1; Windows 8 is end of life as of January 2016). Q. Does this policy apply to Windows Server releases?Yes. While some Windows 10 releases have a server counterpart, they (2016, 2019, 2022) are still supported by Microsoft. Q. What if I’m using Windows 10 Enterprise long-term servicing branch/channel (LTSB/LTSC) releases?Since this edition is meant for mission-critical devices, I and my add-ons do not support this scenario. Windows App Essentials add-on itself does not support this configuration either. The key takeaway is this: if you can, please upgrade to supported Windows releases as soon as possible. Feel free to contact me if you have additional questions or comments.Cheers,JosephThanks for the clarification. I do feel that the worries over  security are over the top, but at the moment everyone seems to be taking this line of trying to stop people downloading stuff at their own risk.
I would point out that a straw poll of home users, not scientific at all, I have to say, suggests to me that many, probably about half or slightly less of them are using Windows 7 on at least one machine.

Of course there is nothing stopping them getting windows 10, but many tell me in these cash strapped days that buying new hardware merely to run Windows 11 cannot be justified, so down the line we could be seeing a similar problem with people using 10 who have no plans to go 11.
Of course even if support for 7 ends, there is really nothing to stop people still using the NVDA add ons that work and older copies of those which don't.

"IMPORTANT: Add-on Updater and Windows App Essentials to require NVDA 2022.1 or later, effective September 2022","Hello everyone,I think NVDA 2022.2 was quite a journey for all those involved (as always, a huge thank you to NV Access and third-party contributors). In addition to new table navigation commands (thanks to Tony Malykh), this version includes tons of bug fixes. It is also a huge release for me as you can now use Windows 11 Notepad without relying on an add-on anymore, improvements to touch support for parts of Windows 11 elements, and much improved support for Windows 10 and 11 Calculator.Onto the matter at hand: with NVDA 2022.2 release, I hereby announce that Add-on Updater and Windows App Essentials will ask you to upgrade to newer NVDA releases, effective September 2022. This aligns with add-on support policy from me:Add-on Updater: as the add-on supports current stable version (an exception is made if the current version is a compatibility breaking release, in which case I provide extended support for the old stable version), Add-on Updater will require NVDA 2022.2 or later.Windows App Essentials: this add-on supports current, immediate past, and development releases. As NVDA 2022.1 is now the immediate past release, upcoming September release will require 2022.1 or later.If needed, I can offer add-on releases in August that will bring bug fixes and critical changes for folks still using 2021.3, but no more after that.Key:Current: NVDA 2022.2Immediate past: NVDA 2022.1Old stable prior to compatibility breaking release: NVDA 2021.3Development: alpha/beta/RC builds I’m giving you a notice at least a month in advance so you can prepare accordingly. Ideally it would be best to use NVDA 2022.2, but I understand that there are users relying on older NVDA releases. The good news is that about 90 percent of add-ons registered on community add-ons website are compatible with NVDA 2022.x. Thanks, and enjoy the new NVDA release.Cheers,Joseph",297,14,0.047138047,0.047138047,1,312,75.71,23.15,60.26,91.4,44.57,27.24,77.24,55.45,39.42,8.33,4.17,2.56,0,1.6,0,0,4.17,9.29,4.81,6.41,12.18,5.77,3.53,6.41,0.32,11.86,8.33,3.53,1.92,0.32,1.28,0.32,11.22,1.28,9.94,1.28,1.6,1.92,1.6,0,4.49,0,5.13,5.13,0,0.64,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,7.37,4.81,2.56,1.28,0,0,1.92,2.56,0.32,0,0,0,0.96,0,0,0.96,1.92,0,1.6,0.32,0,0,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.56,3.21,0.32,0.32,2.24,0,0,0.32,10.58,2.24,7.05,1.92,0,0,0,0,0,22.12,7.37,5.45,0,0,0.32,8.97

"Important announcement on Joseph Lee's add-ons: please upgrade to NVDA 2022.2 ASAP, support policy changes 3 messages","Hello everyone,Hope you are enjoying NVDA 2022.2. But even then, let us not forget that we are in the midst of a pandemic, conflicts abound, and things are uncertain at this moment.The following notice applies to people using Add-on Updater and Windows App Essentials as this amounts to a major add-on support policy notice:As folks may know, throughout July I have worked on Project Meteor, a project to rewrite vast parts of Add-on Updater which became part of version 22.08. But that wasn’t the only thing in my mind: I kept coming back to the question of how to support people using soon to be unsupported Windows releases, and I keep hearing rumors about changes to Windows development plan from Microsoft. Adding to the mix is latest changes to NVDA source code, specifically preparations being made for NVDA 2022.3 beta. After assessing the situation and analyzing recent add-on support plans I made, I decided that consistency is better than complicating things for users. Therefore, I announce three major changes to support policy for Add-on Updater and Windows App Essentials: one for Add-on Updater, two for Windows App Essentials.First, both add-ons will require NVDA 2022.2 this September. Typically I support up to two past NVDA stable releases, more so for Windows App Essentials. However, given that important parts of Windows App Essentials are now part of NVDA (as of 2022.2), I believe that it makes sense to standardize around 2022.2, both for consistency and to reduce maintenance burden. Therefore, instead of 2022.1, Windows App Essentials will ask you to use 2022.2 starting from September (likely with 22.09).Second, after considering maintenance burden and complexity, I’m scrapping Add-on Updater Nightlight altogether. Nightlight, meant to provide minimal service on Windows 7 and 8.1, consist of two parts: turning off automatic updates, and disallowing development add-on releases. This means apart from features requiring Windows 10 and 11, folks using old Windows releases will be able to continue to check for add-on updates and can instruct NVDA to do so automatically and/or update to development builds. But please remember: once Microsoft ends support for Windows 7 and 8.1 (the latter for everyone in January 2023), you are on your own – I will not provide new features specific to old Windows releases from January 2023 onwards, so consider this a feature freeze announcement for Windows 7 and 8.1.Third, regarding Windows App Essentials, a prominent tech press cited by other sources indicate that Microsoft might be changing Windows development schedule. Details are uncertain, but if this is correct, it can bring a major change to Windows as a Service (WaaS) concept. If this change does become real, it can lead to a situation where it becomes possible to add changes to a Windows 11 feature update just prior for it being discontinued for consumers (unlikely but possible), and changes will be more frequent. For Windows App Essentials, this means it becomes harder to plan when to drop a feature update (tentative plan is to end support for Windows 10 November 2021 Update and Windows 11 original release in March and July 2023, respectively, a few months prior to end of consumer support), making my life a bit harder as well. Therefore for sake of consistency and to respond to rumored changes to Windows development schedule, as well as to prepare the way for someone to maintain this add-on if I do end maintenance for it, I’m changing feature update support duration so it aligns with consumer support duration (18 months for Windows 10, two years for Windows 11); for example, with this policy change, end of support for Windows 10 November 2021 Update will be June 2023 instead of March 2023; as always, development snapshots will ask you to upgrade to newer feature updates a few months prior. While this change takes effect with upcoming 22H2 feature updates, I’ll apply this policy change to 21H2 releases for consistency. The only exception is the very last feature update for Windows 10 which will be supported until end of 2025 (officially until October 2025 but a grace period will be added) provided that I’m still maintaining the add-on by then.The key takeaway is this: for users of Joseph Lee’s add-ons, please upgrade to NVDA 2022.2 no later than end of August 2022, preferably as soon as possible (by the way, add-ons compatible with NVDA 2022.1 are also compatible with 2022.2, and some add-ons might be using features from 2022.2 for various things). For folks using Windows App Essentials development builds, NVDA 2022.2 requirement will take effect with the second snapshot of August (next week).Thank you.Cheers,JosephMicrosoft don't make this stuff at all easy do they!

I think a lot more people than they think keep using older versions merely because every time they upgrade days or even weeks are taken to get to know how to configure them and use the changed features. This is not only in the blind community either I have to say.

in the display name field.I upgrade where I can and always try the latest version.

However I agree with your frustration.

Case in point I had to do some servicing on windows 11 on a new lenovo that one of my aunts had.

It came with office trial which I promptly killed.

This wouldn't be a problem but the licence I obtained didn't work due to it being 1 time or something weird from the grey area store I got it but I was able to find another locally so it was eventually fine.

However the dreaded unknown issue happened.

Not a problem, I thought, reinstall office later, run com registration.

That did fix it once but it didn't stay.

Reinstalling nvda and then new adobe reader usually fixes this for a bit and it did a couple times but it never stuck.

The only thing that had an issue with ccleaner as just about everything else I used worked and I had to use narator and nvda in combination.

I'd usually reformat and reload at this point because well I had the software but it wasn't my computer and I couldn't justify doing it for 1 system program that would hardly get used and it did work for the most part.

I could have gone via ms support but experience shhowed me that support for me has been 9 times out of 10 a waste of time with potential dammage long the lines and it appears from some quarters it got worse.

I have family saying windows 11 is a big problem and I must agree.

I see no reason to upgrade to 11 at least not now and at least while win10 still works.

Plus I never saw any performance hikes on the new ryzen unit I had been using.

In contrast the latest amd drivers and windows updates have actually pushed performance on this 2nd gen higher so there is that.

Where I can I update but heck I am a bit of a hacker geek that way.

Of course I do have a lot of mods here but even so, I really don't want to go through the process of reinstalling because every time these days you reload its never the same and it takes way to much time these days.

I used to have the time but these days I can barely find enough and at others well I have more than enough but I really don't want to be spending it on my desk.

As for older stuff working yeah, there are plenty of things that are non critical that I barely update because I don't need to.

So I see the reason why some don't.

My dad has office 2016 which has no more updates, it appears but he still uses it and it works.

He is retired and well I don't see any real advantage to updating his office especially because his key is legal and works well enough.

The documents he has are his own and he doesn't recieve attachments to do with anything in word.

To be honest if it wasn't for a load of older word documents which I should probably convert at some point so I can go to something else like jarte it wouldn't be any stretch for me bar the daisy converter for word which I hardly use to not use office except I like the interface.

Its a hold over from my old days but to be honest when I finally need another computer or a rebuild  I will probably switch to something else, maybe who knows.

I technically do have a legal office xp which I own which with the right engine upgrades will probably handle the newer formats so well who knows.

I don't need it for much bar reading documents from dolphin for their test team and my other work I rarely if ever actually use it as intended.

My aunt has another office which I got but she only has outlook for attachments that need it and its almost never used.

Improved Paragraph Navigation,"Hello,
 
I am currently working on a feature to bring improved paragraph navigation to NVDA. This feature uses the existing paragraph navigation commands, Control Up Arrow for previous paragraph and Control Down Arrow for next paragraph, but adds support for both normal and block style paragraphs to editors which do not natively support such navigation. You may also assign a hotkey to toggle through these paragraph navigation styles quickly.
 
I am interested in your feedback on this feature. If you are interested, please see NVDA Issue: Improve Paragraph Navigation -- Add Normal and Block Style #13798
 
If you wish to test this new feature, you can find a build of NVDA that contains it at the following link:

Improving accessibility of Spotify for desktop 13 messages,"Hello.

I don't know, where to post It. I'll try to post It here.

Maybe You know about Spotify. New interface is better accessible, than this previous. I think to Spotify for desktop. Sometimes NVDA don't read everything on Spotify, for example playlist view in 'Your library' ETC. Similar thing is with moving playlists to folders, althought with new interface Spotify's accessibility is better.

I don't know, how to programm, but please somebody make Spotify for desktop accessible with NVDA. It is very good software.

Thank You.

best regards

Marco Oroshi marco this is paul faucheux. with regards to spotify the interface is verry easy to use with nvda. what are you having trouble with. i can help you off list. i can be reached at pf112781@... or 985-400-3787They already have a layout you can get ot that is fully accessible. I forgot how to do it but you need to edit a CFG file. My BF told me about it and I've seen him use it with no issues. I've been using spotify since 2017 in electron mode and it is grate.

      view.
    Also, in My computer this interface is actually default.
    Playlists are viewed in left, but not at 'Your library' section.

      napísal(a):Hi people, I am back in this thread.
    After new update, Spotify's playlist view in Your library is
      accessed very well.
    Also, I need some people, some blind users, who will register in
      Spotify community and vote for My accessible ideas for Spotify, or
      create another ideas to vote for. There are not many votes to get
      It to Spotify. I will be happy, if Spotify will be more accessible
      for the blind, like It is.

    
    Dňa 7. 5. 2021 o 0:08 Marco Oros via
      groups.io napísal(a):Have things changed?  A number of years ago, Spotify’s position was 
that accessibility wasn’t their responsibility.  One or two blind 
developers created accessibility solutions they sold for Spotify.  Spotify 
did become more accessible when they released an entirely redesigned interface, 
but that was unintended and coincidental improvement.  
 
If their position has changed, that would be good to know.  If it 
hasn’t, I doubt that having a little more clamor on the community site will make 
any difference.  The community site is where users discuss things.  A 
few more blind people talking about accessibility isn’t going to convince 
management of anything.  
 
GeneTo clarify, I don’t mean they sold their solutions in any relationship with 
Spotify.  There were completely independent and Spotify had no interest in 
the solutions.  
 
GeneHi.
    Sorry to write this post lately, but playlist interface at 'Your
      library' finally works with screen reader NVDA.
    I have contacted developers of Spotify and they solved It.
    

    
    Dňa 18. 5. 2021 o 13:08 Gene
      napísal(a):Hello again. I am here after long time.

    
    After update of Spotify, the mouse cursor isn't says sometimes
      anything, when I would like to move somewhere. It is very bad to
      me, because I can't move playlists, playlist folders or songs in
      playlists.
    I think, that NVDA will soon need some add-on to improve those
      things.

    
    Dňa 18. 5. 2021 o 12:47 Marco Oros via
      groups.io napísal(a):On the other hand much like Team viewer, and dropbox, maybe the authors of these programs and web interfaces need to get their ttesting the accessibility right before they go live with a new version. Ahem. Perhaps we need some kind of list of second line or accessibility support points of contact for an many of these often updated services as possible.

in the display name field.Discord solved the problem of moving servers and channels around
      in your list by using ctrl+D to pick up and Enter to put down. I
      would definitely like a similar feature in Spotify so I could
      actually make Playlist Folders to sort all my playlists for
      fanfiction ideas from playlists to listen to while writing and
      playlists of favourites within a certain genre.
    

    
    I haven't the faintest idea of who to ask about this, but I would
      like to be able to adjust the order of songs in a playlist (I've
      messed up said order before to my chagrin), and also to move
      playlists into folders. Spotify is not exactly the most scrupulous
      company, so I suppose we'd have to make an addon for that...Try contacting them and making that suggestion, I like that idea. I’m a discord user. Salesforce did something similar. You hit space to rearrange the item, move it to where you want it to be then hit space to drop it. It’s quite neat.  Any of those would work re Spotify IMHO.Hi,You'd actually be very surprised at the effort Spotify has been putting into accessibility recently. An email / community forum topic may actually get this sorted a lot easier than you think. As it happens, moving playlists can still be done with NVDA's drag and drop commands but it isn't really a perfectly viable option. With playlists that contain a lot of songs actually scrolling through them can be an incredible pain since focus seems to be dragged down to a random spot unless you've found a way around this I'm not aware of. This is still no excuse for their actions.That being said, if we're going to mention accessibility or the lack thereof, it wasn't too long ago that discord was almost completely unusable. Deafen, mute, disconnect buttons were all unlabeled for years, most buttons and switches weren't readable and by and large it was a huge mess. A few *years* later, they finally started making improvements and I'm happy about that, but it took a lot of pressure and a lot of people mentioning them on twitter.But I can reliably say without a doubt spotify is working on accessibility and fixing things, slowly but surely. I'd be more than happy to upvote anything you post in that regard and comment with anything that might help in the community.thanks",1128,39,0.034574468,0.034574468,1,1140,44.66,28.04,56.6,52.78,14.62,20.88,83.68,66.93,54.39,13.68,7.98,3.95,0.61,1.93,0.09,1.23,5.7,11.93,4.47,2.37,14.65,9.39,6.23,6.4,1.75,18.07,4.65,4.04,3.95,1.49,2.02,0.44,15.88,0.53,15.09,2.54,1.67,2.46,3.6,1.32,4.39,0.09,3.95,2.98,0.88,1.4,0.79,0.53,0,0,0.35,0,8.95,3.6,0.88,0.96,0,0.18,2.11,5.35,0,0.09,0,0.18,0.79,0.26,0,0.53,4.39,2.19,0,2.02,0.18,0,1.05,0.18,0.09,0,0,0,0.09,0.09,0,0.61,0.09,0.44,0.09,0.09,0,0,0.26,0.35,5.88,8.6,0.35,1.93,5.09,0.96,0.53,0.18,3.68,3.77,4.82,1.49,0.61,0.61,0.09,0,0,18.86,8.51,4.39,0.09,0,3.33,2.54

Most are also working with the latest Alpha as well, but I gather there may need to be a few breaking changes for some new features.

      One thing I noticed when reading of my mother's tongue: 

      Tagalog is very clear and crisp. 

      I am using the default Voice: English (Great Britain) and Variant:
      Max

      for the speach engine e-Speak ng. 

      I know you are not fun of the variant max though. LOL! 

      But, I was so impressed with the narration even a little dialects
      of my language is so clear. 

      Just to give you overview from the time I used NVDA max and
      alternately used variant quenzy as my choice. 

      

      I tested this out of curiosity as portable to my machine. 

      Cheers,

      Robert MendozaHi Robert,
Oh I am not voicist!  (Is that a word?  I don't have a specific preference of one voice over another).  I'm glad it is working even better for you now! ""--

I created the grandma one just for fun, but you can easily tweak them yourself as I did, there used to be a tutorial on the ESpeak web site telling you what the various registers do in the voice files.

Inconsistency of reporting of heading information 3 messages,"Hello all,

I wanna know if this is a bug or normal behavior.

I am using nvda portable 2022.1 without any addon, default configuration


1. visit file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/NVDA/documentation/en/userGuide.html using your web broswer

2. press t to jump to the first table

3. press , to by pass the table, this time, nvda says '4.7. Reporting System Information heading level 3'

4. press down arrow and up arrow

5. nvda this time says 'heading level 3 4.7. Reporting System Information'

In the first situation, the heading level 3 is reported at the end, whereas the second situation the heading information is reported at the beginning.If you move in different ways, the order in which information is
    presented will differ.  If you move to a visited link in one way,
    you will hear visited link announced before the link is read.  If
    you move another way, you will hear the link read first.

Input Methods for Simplified Mandarin from Pinyin 2 messages,"Dear list, I’m part of an intensive Mandarin course in Germany at the moment. In about a week it will be mandatory for me being able to write simplified characters on a laptop (Windows 10, NVDA 2021.4, using IBM-TTS). Many sighted people use a Pinyin based input method in which they type in the pinyin and are shown homophone characters of which they visually select the right one. Obviously, this method isn’t exactly accessible.
How do blind NVDA-users input simplified chinese characters? I’ve tried the Microsoft Bopomofo keyboard (part of traditional Chinese language packs, but allows simplified output), but I didn’t figure out how to distinguish between homophones so far. I’m glad for any help! BestAlmaricThe pinyin method is actually the method I use. It works this way when
using NVDA:
type the string you want, nihao for example, to say hello.
When the list of homophones comes up, use the arrow keys to move
between choices for that string.
Use object navigation to find out which character is in which
description. Press numpad 2 twice to get a description. this of course
requires you to learn a bit more about which character means, and
enough mandarin to learn the descriptions. Use numpad 1 and 3 to move
to the previous or next characters, respectively. Hope this helps.

Issue With This Apparently Phantom Item 'Task Switcher' With Recent Updates of NVDA 13 messages,"Hi Group,

I have noticed that with some recent updates of either NVDA or Windows 11 itself, that particularly if I have multiple windows open, I see what I believe is a phantom windows identified with (insert + T) as 'Task Switcher.'  When this happens, it makes navigation more difficult, slows down the response of the computer and causes annoying efficiency issues.

Has anyone else experienced this lately and if so, what could be causing this and is there a solution?  Thanks for any help.

DaveIv'e seen this in wondows 10 but I have no idea what causes this to happen. I've seen it with windows t, alt tab, and other places. When it happens it is annoying at best.  And, no I have no idea what causes the issue.Are you sure this is not an intermittent old issue? I'm sure sometimes on Windows 7 this sort of thing happened as well. The only recourse seemed to be to shut and restart nvda then. Sadly I've not used Windows11, so I cannot comment further if its a similar issue.

I haven't used Windows 7 in over 2 years so I can't be sure. I do not remember it happening very much if at all with Windows 7--not enough to write a message to the list anyway.  This seems to have gotten worse with later versions of Windows 10 and the newer Windows 11. I turned on/off the windows shade setting in multitasking and I have only seen it once since then--and I tried deliberately by opening 7 windows one after the other to test. ""--

Its weird, since one might expect it to contain a list of tasks, but that is on the normal bar and can be  used just like always.
It acts a bit like that old  problem where NVDA, had its own phantom window which would not be closed, and if somebody managed to close it by the mouse, nvda went away. Not tried that here, assuming there is in fact a way to close it at all.
It seems worse on those running Windows 7 home than any other flavour.
Could it maybe a  ram thing, IE if there are a lot of programs open on a machine with not quite enough ram, it then uses the disc as virtual memory, so that then means things start to slow down.

in the display name field.I've always assumed it comes up when all switchable (alt+tabbable) applications are busy, and can't re-render their interfaces for some reason. So Windows can't finish switching to them. But that's a wild guess.

I've only ever run into it when I have three or fewer applications open, which is so very rare that I haven't encountered it enough to bother me.

But I'm pretty sure I have encountered it from time to time in Windows 10 of various releases. (I never had Win 7)

LukeIt evidently is the name of the interface that comes up when you alt
    tab.  A sighted person evidently sees the names of all opened
    programs and we, of course, hear the program that has focus when we
    alt tab to it.  A Google search for task switcher Windows 10 gave
    this result and others I didn't look at:

    https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/switch-tasks-windows-10/

    

    As for the running short of memory hypothesis, that has no bearing
    on the question.  If you run short of RAM, programs are swapped to
    the hard drive when not being used.  If you use alt tab to switch to
    another program, that program comes out of the swap file and is
    placed in RAM while the program you were previously using goes into
    the swap file.  The swapping occurs when you release alt tab on the
    program you want to switch to.

    

    GeneI normally have about 8 or so apps open on several desktops. I've only seen
this twice, and it's so rare I forget when it happens, It is annoying though
when it wants to happen.I experienced this on my Windows 11 laptop. I agree it is quite annoying. I found a workaround - you need to enable classic Alt+Tab dialog:
1. Install program called winaero tweaker
2. Appearance > Alt-Tab appearance > Enable classic Alt+Tab dialog

--TonyHi Tony,

I downloaded and installed this Winaero Tweaker program and I can't seem to make head nor tail of it.  I thought you said it was accessible with NVDA.  Please advise. ""--

I installed the wrong program. It was the repair tools. That is definitely inaccessible. Once I installed the Winaero 1.44.exe, I see the interface works quite well. Now since I checked the box for enable classic alt + tab, will it fix the problem? We shall see. ""--

Have a look under the voice settings and maybe uncheck either this setting called Automatic language switching (when supported)

or the setting below it called Automatic dialect switching (when supported) and see if that does the trick.

I'm assuming you've downloaded Add-on Updater from community add-ons website. If so, the latest version should be 22.07. I'm wondering why NVDA 2022.2 is saying Add-on Updater is incompatible as the add-on supports NVDA 2021.3 and newer releases and compatible with them.

Looking for an accessible twitter client 16 messages,"Hi all,

I am looking for an accessible twitter client that will let me manage
multiple accounts. I use NVDA as my primary screen reader hence my question
to this list.

PranavHey bro, you can try TweeseCake, it's free for now and is amazinghttps://twblue.es might be a good fit.An other option is OpenTween.Do you have a link to open tween?I’ve been using TwBlue for years (including the newest versions) without any problems at all. Goo dluck!

GeraEnviado desde mi iPhone SE (2nd Generation) de TelcelTweesecake also works very well.BenYou can download it here.I think, that eventually, they want to charge for tweesecake.I use chickennuggetHi all, Many thanks for all your suggestions. Have any of you used any client to handle more than 1 twitter account? PranavHi, Yes, both TW Blue and TweeseCake can handle multiple accounts easily. RegardsRichard BartholomewChickennugget allows it but you have to switch.  I don’t’ think it lets you combine them.Hi.
    

    
    I have tried to open the adress
    https://twblue.es/
    but the site was just blank when i used Mozilla Firefox. With
      Microsoft edge, i am being forwarded to a microsoft site where i
      am being prompted the data policy and things like that.
    Is there another link for tw blue?
    

    
    Regards

Man or woman. really strange. 11 messages,"I upgraded to a newer version of NVDA.  But I am also going to upgrade the computer in a few days. Nevertheless, listen to this one.

We use a talk-client, I forget the name.  But it's really well-known.  I used it with Win-eyes, and with the 2015 NVDA. Tonight I went to the I C C, and there were five in the meeting.

Before it would list the name and wouldn't say anything, unless, perhaps, Penny, Away.

Now for each, it told me whether they were Man or Woman.

Betsy, Man; Jack, Man; Lenore, Woman; Marsha, Man; Penny, Man.

Has anyone seen such interesting behavior?

It sure doesn't matter, since no one else sees this.  It's just my NVDA that does it. But I'm upgrading to a new computer; so I'll probably just have new questions for you then.


Best,

PennyOh, that is funny. Thanks for sharing. It was great to see you there tonight.


Take care and get some sleep. ""-- 
Betsy Grenevitch 678-862-3876""Oh wow. That could get very dicey very quickly depending on peoples gender identities lol. Funny anecdote though. I wonder how it makes those determinations?This was audio only; i wonder not only how it makes the designations, but why it does.

In any event, once we go to the win 11 machine, maybe things will change, and most certainly they will; my thick head of hair may get lots thinner lots faster.Before I get banned from this list,
this topic should have either gone to NVDAChat or WindowsAccess, not here since it doesn't impact the way NVDA behaves.
TeamTalk's what you're talking about;
There's ao option to show graphics next to names of people,
i.e. gender, microphone, etc.
People,
Please Watch Where Your Topics Go.
Brian Can't Stress that enough.
I think that oughta be enough!
Jason BratcherPenny Golden wrote:

That would be how it knows.

Is it using an Emoji of a man or a woman, or the actual words?

NVDA is capable of speaking Emoji, but I don't run into them enough online to remember how they are announced.

LukeFirst off, i was warned, or we all were, that this is off-topic.

So I feel like I really just ought to get off the list, for it was my fault that this got brought up.

I figured it was from NVDA, since that evening I had installed a much newer version of NVDA, and that is when it came up.

I am sure that when people set up those accounts, they are asked gender.  I have no idea what was up there; i just heard the word man or woman.  And I figured it had to do with the fact that I was running a newer version of the NVDA.

Well, I hate to upset the apple cart, and we were warned to keep off this topic.


If you only knew what a law-abidin' citizen I really am. I hate list controversy.

Let's try not to talk about this. someone hates it.Penny, in the later version of teamTalk it does announce the gender of the person. You set it in preferences.It is the very next tab after your name. , ""--

or ask your smart speaker to play family times on tune-in""Hi Penny,

Yes, that makes sense. People can specify how they would like to be referred to and perhaps that’s what it’s picking up on. Not sure why you’re worried about controversy etc. as I don’t see anything negative in this thread. Maybe you were talking about something else. CheersJust a casual observer of the original thread here so I don’t really have a horse in this race, but it seemed like the question was asked to determine if it was NVDA related or not. I can understand reserving some topics for those other forums when it’s known that it isn’t specifically NVDA related, but we can also probably give folks the benefit of the doubt too. Not all users are necessarily technically savvy enough to make that distinction on their own. CheersIt could be NVDA announcing this if an emoji is being used.  I
    checked and NVDA does have the announcement man for an emoji of just
    a man and woman for an emoji of just a woman.  Since the emoji NVDA 
    is aware of and will announce is expanded over time in new versions,
    it may well be that the old version you were using wasn't aware of
    those emoji.

    

    

    

    Also, too expand the topic, you may come across web sites where you
    hear shapes and information about shapes announced that is very
    distracting.

    

    I have come across web sites where a shape is used for emphasis, as
    a bullet would be.  So you may be reading a number of points and
    hear, right pointing triangle stated repeatedly before a point
    begins or a number of words, filled right pointing  triangle, then
    some more words, then the same shape, etc.  Depending on what the
    page is using, you may hear various shapes announced in this
    distracting way.  

    

    I won't go into how you stop it, because you have to change a
    setting for any shape you hear and the general method of how you do
    this is beyond the scope of the discussion.  But if you come across
    something and you want to stop it, if you ask here, I will tell you
    or someone else may.

Mcaffee DLP endpoint security software causes NVDA to stop working correctly 6 messages,"I was wondering if anyone could help, recently my organisation has rolled out a new IT security policy and as part of this they have implemented a data loss prevention tool called mcaffee DlP end point, which  takes the form of a Microsoft edge extension.

https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/data-sheets/ds-dlp-endpoint.pdf However, since it’s been installed both browsers that use chromium, chrome and edge have stopped responding with NVDA, for example pressing k to jump to each link no longer works, the cursor doesn’t move and neither does NVDA read out any information, however I can still implement the Microsoft edge keyboard shortcuts but NVDA won’t read anything out.
i’m using the latest version of NVDA and latest version of edge.
Can anyone suggest what might be happening here?Khalid,

You have to search the solution in the mcaffee DlP program so you have
to contact the IT department.
This is a protection that prevent the keys to work and is a sort of
virus/hacking protection.
I know that some anti-virus programs do have a simular option that you
can also disable so the screenreader will work. This problem will also
occure with Jaws.

MartenHi there, thank you for your help so far.
I was wondering if you knew what the setting is called and what it does, what will the IT department need to do to get it working.
Unfortunately I don’t know much about how  screen readers work and neither does the it department.Yes I've seen this affect Firefox if some add one claims safe browsing. What they really mean is OK we will treat all users as idiots and monitor everything and block what we don't like completely missing the point that some people are blind. Took me a while to figure out what was going on, but then I'm admin on my machines. Unfortunately if you have an it department then it is they  who need to fix it, since not doing so is probably not legal in law.

in the display name field.Hi there,
I was wondering if you might know what setting it would be that stops the keyboard command from being recognised by the screen reader and stops the screen reader from reading out the screen,
Unfortunately, my IT department doesn’t know much about screen readers and I don’t know much about them either.
from what I know about data loss prevention tools, they modify which kinds of information I sent to the webpage and what kind of files the websites can read and acceptThere's only a few things I can think of.the keyboard protection or banking protection which other security call them. that will protect keylogger from logging keyboard input. that will usually affect screen readers as we talk directly to certain windows components which by chance, hackers also use.
The other thing the IT guys can check is to check on the log.whatever the security software does, block, remove or do whatever changes in client or workstation, there's always a log for them to review.

Merging cells in Microsoft Word 365 6 messages,"Hello all,
In the menubar, we can find an option to merge an entire row or an entire column.
But suppose a row with six cells. How to merge the second, the third and the forth cells?
I’mam using Windows 10, NVDA 2022.1 and Office 365.
Best regards,
Luciano de SouzaHi,First select all the cells that you need to merge, using “Shift + Right Arrow”Then, on the menu, select and enter on the merge button.Hope this helps.Thanks,Ravi.When I
          press shift+right, being on the cell, I select the next
          characters, not the
          next cells.
      I’ve tried
          also ctrl+shift+right, but it failed too.
      In the
          menu, the merge option was unabled since not more then one
          cell is selected.

And back , and try selecting.Also, try it after saving the work sheet.Select them, then type merge in the action bar, and follow the prompts. This is how I’ve been now doing the merges for a few months now. Love it.  You will select the rows as you do any word with shift plus right arrow. Good luck and happy Friday. If you do not know how to get to the action bar hit alt q from the work sheet and then type what you want to do. Then down arrow to see the results. -------- Sarah AlawamiCheck out both my story and my journey as I learn to fly blind.Hello all.  This topic will be locked after this post, as it has nothing to do with NVDA, but with Microsoft Word.  It belongs in the Chat Subgroup or on the Microsoft Office Accessibility Discussion Group.

Note Well:  I have the Easy Table Navigator NVDA add-on installed and active.  NVDA must be in Focus Mode to allow individual cell selection.  If NVDA is in Browse Mode full rows (and probably columns, but I didn't try that way) get selected when using the SHIFT + Arrow Key commands.

As Sarah has noted, SHIFT + Arrow Key (any one of them, depending on your positioning in the table and where/what you want to select) can be used to select an individual cell or block of cells.  If you have 4 cells selected in a given row in the middle of the table, using Shift + Down Arrow will select the same block in the row below while Shift + Up Arrow will select the same block in the row above.

Merging cells requires only that you bring up the context menu and select the Merge Cells option (and hitting M 2 times after the context menu is up gets you there).

Monthly Group Rules Reminder for the NVDA Group (nvda@nvda.groups.io),"NVDA Group Description:  NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) is screen reader software.  The central purpose of this group is discussing how to use NVDA. This includes configuring NVDA's settings or familiarizing oneself with its modes and commands.  Discussions about which programs are accessible using NVDA, NVDA add-ons, NVDA tutorials and documentation, and configuring synthesizers or Braille displays for use with NVDA are also permitted. Like all screen readers, it is a tool for accessing something else, and really serves no other purpose.  Its function as an accessibility tool is, of course, its reason for being.

What follows is the NVDA Group Monthly Reminder Notice, which is meant to reacquaint members with the NVDA Group Rules.

In addition to the NVDA Group Specific rules which follow, all members are expected to adhere to the NVAccess Citizen and Contributor Code of Conduct.  This is for the main NVDA Group and all subgroups.  If you have a grievance against an individual whom you believe to have violated the code of conduct during any interaction on this group, please e-mail us at nvda+owner@nvda.groups.io and the issue will be investigated and addressed promptly and confidentially.


The following rule has never been applied, but is necessary for managing unforeseen circumstances.  The Group Owner and Moderators reserve the right to block, edit, or remove any message at any time at our sole discretion.  Any message that has content that violates the Groups.io Terms of Service is not permitted, is subject to immediate removal, and the member posting same to be placed on moderated status or banned, at the sole discretion of the Group Owner or Moderator. 
The discussion of software on the NVDA Group is limited to software currently in support.  Depending on the type of software, specific version numbers will change with time.  Users are expected to know what remains in support and what has been dropped, and announcements will be made to this group when new versions of NVDA are released. It should be assumed that, when a new version of software is released, primary discussion will take place on that version, not versions of software which are years old. 


Unsupported versions of any software may only be discussed on the Chat Subgroup, not the main NVDA Group. 


Windows:  Only Windows 8.1 and currently supported versions of Windows 10 and 11.  Members should refer to the Windows Lifecycle Fact Sheet to determine which versions of Windows are currently supported.  Information about the dates on which specific versions of Windows 10 reached or will reach their end of service dates is listed there as well and will be updated as new versions are released. 


Note that it is acceptable to direct a user to the NVAccess or Microsoft sites where older versions can be downloaded, however, this is different than supporting a specific version of software or operating system.


NVDA:  NVDA has, at any given time, a single version under active support.  If a question arises about how to update to that version, and you’re on an earlier version, that will be permitted as transition problems can occasionally occur.


It is presumed that the majority of members will be using NVDA, and possibly other screen readers, as part of their daily routine.  This being the case, before you post a message you have to consider whether the question you are about to ask is actually about NVDA itself, or about the program you’re using it to access.  Questions of the form, How do I use . . . with NVDA?, are very seldom about NVDA, but are almost always about the program being accessed with NVDA.
The NVDA Group has a Chat Subgroup (see: https://nvda.groups.io/g/chat, Group Email Addresses section) that has as its purpose the asking of virtually any “off-topic” question about anything you can think of, including just socializing.  It should be used for exactly that purpose. The Chat Subgroup has generally had technically focused topics related to using features of the programs that one is using NVDA to access or about other programs that have proven helpful.  Only those who are already members of the NVDA Group can subscribe to the Chat Subgroup.  
Before choosing where to post, please ask yourself the question, “Is what I’m about to ask or offer directly related to controlling or using NVDA, or whether a specific program is accessible with NVDA?”  If that can be answered, “Yes,” then post to the NVDA Group, and if the answer is, “No,” then the topic belongs in the NVDA Chat Subgroup.
In order to make your experience, and those of all other members, as pleasant as they can be, we ask members to follow these practices:
1.  Use threaded or conversation view in your e-mail client program or webmail and to read all messages in a topic before replying.  It gets you completely up to speed and avoids a lot of repetition.  If you choose not to use threaded/conversation view, please take the time to read through all messages from the group that are in your inbox prior to adding any reply to the group.  It’s the only way you can be sure you’re up to speed on any topic when not using threaded/conversation view.
2.  Read all messages in any new topics before replying, as topics have a tendency to get split upon occasion and often an answer ends up being in a separate topic.
3. If you have reason to believe your question has likely been asked and answered in the past please search the Group Archive first before asking it again.  Step-by-Step instructions for searching the group archive using the Groups.io search or a web search engine of your choosing: Searching a Groups.io Topics Page/Archive.  Please consider using a web search first for questions that have almost certainly been asked frequently and for which myriad answers, often in the form of tutorials, already exist.

4.  Think very carefully about the title you are going to give any topic you post.  The topic is the first (and, sometimes, only) thing a member sees and that may be how they decide if they’re going to look further.   Generic titles such as, “Weird Problem,” or “Help Me!,” are not helpful because they give no idea about what.  Compare that to something like, “NVDA not reading Excel cell contents,” or, “NVDA setting for pronouncing numbers,” where the exact issue where help is needed is front and center.   Even something like, “Need help with the following . . .,” lets the reader know that you are going to present a list of issues.
5.  Please avoid, “What is the best . . .?,” topics, because what qualifies as “best” is entirely subjective.   Topics of this sort are also always chat topics.  If you know you have specific needs then asking, “What {insert program type here} has the following features . . .,” is much more descriptive.   If you want to know what programs people like for a specific task, asking, “What’s your favorite . . . and why?,” is far more likely to get you the details you want to have.  Notice that none of the above questions ask about whether a program is accessible with NVDA.  If you’re asking something like, “Which {insert program class here} is accessible with NVDA?,” then it’s a main group topic.
6.  Any topic that is not about using NVDA to accomplish a task, or how to control NVDA, belongs in the chat subgroup, not the main group.  All questions about how to use the specific features of a program that you’re using NVDA to access, but not about NVDA itself, belong in the chat subgroup.
Respectful, even if slightly heated, disagreements will occur occasionally and will be tolerated provided what is described next does not occur.  Flaming, name calling, instigating arguments for their own sake that do nothing to advance anyone’s knowledge, pointed rudeness, and similar boorish behavior will not be tolerated.  If at any point one of you happens upon a message anywhere in the NVDA Group sphere, main or chat, that fits the preceding description then please report it to the group owner either via e-mail at, nvda+owner@nvda.groups.io, or, if you read via the web interface at https://nvda.groups.io/g/nvda/topics, then use the Report this message option that’s a part of the More button at the end of each message.  Please don’t add a protest message the topic.  If we receive a report and agree with it, the issue will be taken care of promptly.

More VPN issues 2 messages,"I’m having even more issues with my work VPN at the moment.
It used to be that whenever I first loaded up Windows, the login page with VPN will come up straight away and I could just enter my details, but now that doesn’t happen so I type the name of the VPN into the search box, it’s called checkpoint endpoint security but NVDA will just say unknown invisible, and pressing NVDA plus r together Will say content not visible.
Sighted people can click a yellow padlock in the corner of the screen and when the mouse is hovering over that padlock, I too can click it and access the login screen but I need to assistance to do this.
Does anyone know what could be happening here and how I can get the program to run from the start menu.
A few other things I’ve tried is to look for the program in the start menu and try it that way but the same issue happens.High chance , its running in the system tray or notification area.Just hit window key and b, it will bring focus there.

alternatively, go into this option call Select which icons appear on the taskbar Linkand make sure this option callAlways show all icons in the notification area Button

that should resolve of you needed someone sighted to click on the bottom right hand corner which its the notification area or system tray.by default, windows will hide those icons so to prevent clattering the area.you can also go the settings i mentioned without turning  Always show all icons in the notification area Button, tab and find your icon you want to always show.

More data on NVDA and gmail speech loss 2 messages,"A couple of weeks back, I reported a problem with NVDA losing speech while scrolling through my gmail list.  I've since installed 2022.1RC2, and tweaked some profile settings for Chrome specifically.  I can now report that, when I lose speech, and have to alt-tab away and back to regain it, NVDA changes from my chrome profile to my generic profile.  I can tell because my speech rates differ between these two profiles.

Christopher BartlettChristopher,
I wasn't on the list when you posted that, but since you are losing
speech, I am assuming you are using the Gmail standard interface? A
couple weeks ago, I was having a similar problem with Firefox that
seems to have resolved itself. I think when this happened, I would
restart NVDA, which would give me speech back, but Firefox would be
not responding. After a couple minutes, NVDA would say ""attempting to
reconnect,"" and things would act normally again. I'm not sure what
broke this or what fixed it, but I haven't had this problem in a
couple weeks.",178,6,0.033707865,0.033707865,1,177,12.65,1,90.74,5.94,19.67,20.34,83.05,71.19,56.5,19.21,11.3,9.6,0,1.69,0,0,7.91,11.86,4.52,1.69,10.17,11.3,4.52,9.04,2.26,19.77,1.69,6.21,2.26,0,2.26,0,18.64,0,18.64,2.26,3.39,4.52,2.82,0,6.21,0,2.82,0.56,2.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.34,5.65,0,0,0,0,4.52,1.69,0,0,0,0,1.13,0,0,1.13,1.13,0,0,1.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.13,0,0.56,0,0,0,0,1.69,0,3.39,3.39,0,0,3.39,0,0,0,8.47,5.08,5.08,1.13,0,0,0,0,0,19.21,5.08,8.47,0.56,0,2.26,2.82

    explanation of what you can do with it.

    If you have questions or problems, ask.

    

    GeneAlso, if you open tools, in the NVDA menu, open Manage Add-ons, then
    down arrow to the add-on you want to know about, you can then tab to
    an add-on help button.  Press the space bar on the button and your
    default browser will open with the same or pretty much the same
    information as is on the web page for the add-on, describing its
    use.

    

    I don't know if all add-ons have a help button but most of them do. 
    

    GeneThis [particular add-on doesn't have that help button, which is
      what prompted the original question.
    

    
    MaryMaybe the help button isn't available in the newest version.  In the
    version I am using, compatible with recent versions of NVDA, but I
    don't think the current version of NVDA, there is a help button.

    

    GeneWell, I just checked, and my version, which is compatible with
      the latest NVDA, does not have a help button that I can see.
    

    
    MaryNo, this particular add-on doesn't have a Help button. That's why I asked here.

Multiple voices with NVDA. 3 messages,"Hi Team,Sorry if this question had been answered here before.I want to know whether it is possible to have a feature that we could set multiple voices within NVDA in a single profile.E.G.

However, you can, using profiles in the NVDA menu, set different voices for different applications. For example, I use Vocalizer Ava in Word, Vocalizer Zoe in Chrome, and Vocalizer Susan in Thunderbird.

NV Speech Player 6 messages,"Hi,
Does anyone know when or if NV Speech Player will be compatible with
the latest version of NVDA? I was looking for different voices for
NVDA and am interested in trying it out, but when I tried to install
it I got an error saying that it was incompatible with the current
version.
BobIts abandoned so its not going to be that way unless someone wants to make it work.

I tried to do the quick and dirty manafest shuffle but it doesn't show so its going to need some work so if you want it fork it yourself.

The klatt stuff is in espeak so fiddle with that first.Here's a version that should work with NVDA 2022.1. https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MotT8z99LwTlOROy3-cftYHvexmzu6FRHmm. I just installed that, and am running it now. Is there a way that
that Google Drive link can be added to the addons site? Also, I think
I am going to need some help understanding all of its settings.Bob Cavanaugh wrote:

LukeOne more question,
Is this a new synth developed by NV Access, or an open source synth,
and would it be possible to add an American accent? This would be an
interesting poll to see whether or not I'm in the majority, but I
prefer synths that speak with the accent I'm most familiar with, and
while I like how NV Speech Player's synth sounds, I'm having a hard
time understanding its accent.",289,11,0.038062284,0.038062284,1,294,20.96,5.68,46.86,29.39,22.62,12.93,84.35,70.75,57.48,17.01,6.12,4.76,0,0.68,0,0.34,10.88,14.63,6.8,1.02,9.52,11.56,5.44,8.5,1.02,21.77,4.76,3.74,2.72,0.34,2.04,0.34,15.65,0.34,15.31,2.38,1.36,4.76,3.06,0.34,6.12,0,2.72,1.7,1.02,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,5.44,3.06,0.34,0.68,0,0,2.38,2.38,0,0,0,0,1.7,0,0.34,1.36,1.02,0,0,1.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.68,0.68,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,1.36,6.46,8.16,1.02,1.7,4.08,1.36,0.34,0.34,3.4,2.72,7.14,2.72,0.68,0.34,0,0.34,0,14.63,5.1,4.08,1.7,0,2.04,1.7

NVDA 2022.1 and add-ons: compatibility updates 15 messages,"Hi all,This thread is a continuation of an earlier post from me regarding NVDA 2022.1 and your favorite add-ons. To avoid attaching dates to thread titles, I’m making it a bit more general (see the title) so updates can be posted without creating new threads. On behalf of NVDA add-ons community, I’m happy to report that more than 40 percent of add-ons registered on community add-ons website (addons.nvda-project.org) are compatible with upcoming NVDA 2022.1 release. Notable in this update is that most of Tony Malykh’s add-ons such as Sentence Nav and Bluetooth Audio are now compatible. As always, keep track of compatibility status of your favorite add-ons from the following link:Add-ons and backwards incompatible NVDA releases (nvda-project.org) Notice that some add-ons are marked “testing in progress”. This means the author have released a development version of add-ons and waiting for NVDA 2022.1 is released before releasing a stable version to users. An important reminder before coming back to post compatibility updates later:One way to keep add-ons updated is with help from add-ons such as Add-on Updater. If you haven’t installed this add-on, I urge you to please, please, PLEASE install it. Add-on Updater can be found here:Add-on Updater (nvda-project.org) Whenever a new stable version of NVDA is released (including backward compatibility breaking release), Add-on Updater is one of the first add-ons declared compatible. Or, for that matter, if you rely on add-ons, do NOT start testing beta releases (especially year.1 beta releases) UNTIL Add-on Updater is updated (I heard that the person responsible for Add-on Updater keeps a close eye on add-on compatibility).Thanks, and please stay safe and healthy (we are still going through a pandemic).Cheers,JosephHi,

Update as of May 23, 2022 (the day NVDA 2022.1 stable version was released): over 60 percent of add-ons registered on community add-ons website are showing as compatible with more updates on the way (at least four add-on updates were queued for distribution on community add-ons website as of this moment, and if things go well, Add-on Updater will offer them to you around this time tomorrow). My task for the next few days before I officially go offline in June: asking Add-on Updater to offer add-on updates to users. There may or may not be such a task in June (highly unlikely for my own physical and mental well-being, so if you are an add-on author and reading this message, consider May 27, 2022 as the last day to queue add-on updates for broad distribution for this round).

I will address the question of manifests in a separate post - I'm sort of on a writing spree before I crash again, and I will show you why editing manifests is not a long-term solution (hint: Python advances).

Cheers,

JosephHi.  I just installed NVDA 2022.1, and I've got a few add-ons that are listed as incompatible and were therefore disabled.  Will add-on updater still detect them at a later date and allow them to be reenabled?  The add-ons in question are Emoticons 14.7, Quick Dictionary 2.1.4, and Virtual Review 21.06.

Thanks,

LouiseHi,How about Word-Nav, is there a new version?Hi,

There should be an ew release of Woprd Nav.

Several updates to the compatibility list:


As of May 26, 2022, about 73% of add-ons are showing as compatible from add-on compatibility page (see the below link). This includes add-ons under testing (that is, queued for distribution on community add-ons website).
Braile Extender is now compatible with NVDA 2022.1 (latest stable version released last week).

Cheers,

JosephJoseph, thank you and who all helps you with the ad-ons for your
      work.
    

    
    I also want to say that if the clock ad-on is ever fixed that
      will be great. When it is now silent when the cukoo clock used to
      go off I feel like something is  missing.
    

    
    Thanks to everyone who adds so much to this screen reader. ""--

      678-862-3876""Hi all,

A lot of goodies in this update (as of May 30, 2022):


A lot of add-ons are now compatible- about 80%, including add-ons showing as ""testing in progress"" a.k.a. queued for distribution on community add-ons website. If we take out Enhanced ARIA and Screen Curtain which are NVDA features and NV Speech Player which is part of eSpeak NG and Newfon for which we don't have updated info on maintenance, compatibility percentage rises to about 84%. Considering that until last week 60% of ad-ons were compatible, this is a huge progress - at least I can worry less during my vacation in June.
If you are using Add-on Updater (or if not, go ahead and install Add-on Updater), check for add-on updates because at least seven add-on updates are available.
IMPORTANT: some add-ons will require NVDA 2022.1, notably Notepad++ add-on which was updated today.
Fixed (finally) the root cause of updated VLC add-on not being offered through Add-on Updater - yet another server-side oversight - specifically, the database was using a wrong data point for this add-on.
Clock and Virtual Review add-on updates were released by maintainers and were queued for distribution on community add-ons website. If things go well, Add-on Updater will offer them to you this coming week.
It might be possible that at least one more add-on may become compatible in coming days to weeks, and a very exciting add-on is in the works (not written by me).


And with that, I'm done with updating compatibility info for now. Enjoy the new add-on updates.

P.S. When I come back in July, I will talk about NVDA 2022.1 requirement for my own add-ons - I'm reviewing specific details. Although things are not really set in stone, all I can say at this time is that, before end of this year, my add-ons (Add-on Updater and Windows App Essentials) will ask you to upgrade to NVDA 2022.1. There is also a small possibility that I might rather ask for NVDA 2022.2 (won't go into details, but I can tell you that this upcoming NVDA release (alpha at the moment) packs interesting new features and changes, some of which folks have been asking for years; the update also includes at least two changes that will be useful for add-ons community, one of which will benefit app module writers a lot). I also need to revisit an earlier post I wrote concerning Windows 7 and my add-ons (a different thread, really), something I'm also thinking about and may have something to say by this fall.

Cheers,

JosephHi Joseph,The status of Newfon is as follows.We should remove it from the official site, as the original author mentioned passed away. synthesizer was taken by the another Russian author, which has the code, and synthesizer itself is not under Gpl.There is compatible version on the external resource maintained by the Russian community.Hi,

Can you bring this up on add-ons list? I figured there are others that may need to be examined.

Cheers,

JosephHi!Yes, i can bring the whole matter to the NVDA- addons mailing list.This should be examined, we should make somehow contact with authors, and to see the status of their add-ons and what not.Best,ZvonimirHi,Extendet Winamp 2.2 Addon provided via updater.The CTRL+Shift+T shortcut has been removed.How do we find out the total time?I will be happy if you inform me.Kind regards,Umut KORKMAZ Windows için Posta ile gönderildi Kimden: Joseph Lee

GeneHi Group,

    

    I can confirm this issue. I used object navigation to solve it by
    making sure the screen setting was set to object navigation and then
    using insert + numpad 4 and 6 to focus on the total track length
    item.

    You must open the track time information with control + J first to
    use this method.

NVDA 2022.2 Losing Focus 7 messages,"Hi all,
Recently I installed the new NVDA version, but it started causing problems. For some apps, it announces the windows, but nothing inside it. The process of the app must be killed and the app started again so that it might work. This solution does not work in one particular case described below so I had to downgrade NVDA.
Conditions:
NVDA 2022.2
Windows 10
user account control is active
OpenVPNConnectGUI installed

scenario:
start open vpn gui
click ""yes"" on the uac security dialog
the window of the app is no longer accessible.

Downgrading NVDA resolved the issue, so it is the new version. Does anyone had such issues or are they able to replicate this one? I'm asking so that I'm sure before opening an issue on Github.Do you have any old logs from that version of nvda you could email to the devs? Also have you tried any troubleshooting steps besides that one to see  if it really is nvda 22.x?Please note, after updating any software, it is a good idea to restart the computer. Restart by going to the Shutdown dialog, selecting “restart” and pressing ENTER. Updating software can change files which are in use. This can lead to instability and strange behaviour which is resolved by rebooting. This is the first thing to try if you do notice anything odd after updating.

I rebooted last time, and, it worked.  Give that a try.In all cases, whether you have the intention to file a GitHub issue for NVDA or not, when there are any irregularities in the behavior of NVDA, you should perform The Most Basic Troubleshooting Steps for Suspected NVDA Issues

If the first fixes the problem, there's no reason to do the second, and if the second fixes things, there's no reason to do the third.  But you will need to have done all three if you intend to file a GitHub issue, as those are required steps that you must confirm you have taken.

         ~ Vance PackardI mentioned this when it appeared to be saying it was running a portable version after an update and doing a complete shut down and a restart fixed this. Some system labelled files just don't like to be deleted. This was a problem even in old XP.

Another thing always worth a try is to see if the registry fixing tool can sort it out. Yet another is to see what else is running when the software giving the problems is running.
Sometimes if part of office is stuck running and you open something all sorts of funny stuff can happen.

NVDA 2022.2 and Microsoft Word 8 messages,"Since updating to NVDA 2022.2, I am finding editing in Microsoft Word
problematic. I use Office 365 and the version of Word is showing
Microsoft Office version 16.0.15330.20264. When I arrow around,
especially with left and right or adding CONTROL to navigate by word,
words or characters are inconsistently spoken, making it difficult to
tell where I am in the document. Any ideas as to how I can get behavior
back to what it was in previous NVDA revisions?If you have not done these already, please first try:  The Most Basic Troubleshooting Steps for Suspected NVDA Issues

After that, if none fixed the issue my next step is doing an uninstall and reinstall of NVDA itself, always fetching a fresh copy of the NVDA installer to do so.

If that doesn't do it, then I uninstall NVDA again, purge the folder %APPDATA%/nvda  AFTER having copied off any speech dictionaries (the SpeechDicts folder) and Profiles I may have created.  I let add-ons get nuked, but you could also back up that folder as well before deleting its parent NVDA folder in %APPDATA%.  After reinstalling, see if everything is OK.  If it is, then restore those folders - ONE AT A TIME - to the %APPDATA%/nvda folder, checking whether everything's still OK after you've restored each one.  I haven't often needed to go this far, but on rare occasion, I have.

All of the above is presuming that the root cause is NVDA.  It never hurts to do an Office Repair Install after the basic NVDA troubleshooting steps, as on rare occasions it's something in Office itself.  That can save you from the uninstall/reinstall of NVDA (but not often).

The difference between a top-flight creative man and the hack is his ability to express powerful meanings indirectly.
         ~ Vance PackardHi Brian and all: Since my problems also occurred in NVDA 2022.1,
      I believe them to be related to this change. This release includes
      major improvements to UIA support with MS Office. For Microsoft
      Office 16.0.15000 and higher on Windows 11, NVDA will use UI
      Automation to access Microsoft Word documents by default. This
      provides a significant performance improvement over the old Object
      model access. I am seeing problems with editing in Microsoft Word
      in both Windows 10 and Windows 11. I wonder if there might be a
      way to fix this in preferences/advanced. I would not want to
      change anything in there unless someone tells me what to change,
      because I do not know what I am doing in there.The only setting dealing with Word that I can see in advanced
    settings is this one:

    Use UI Automation to access Microsoft Word document controls Default
    (Where suitable

    

    There is no off setting in the combo box.  There is a setting that
    says something like when necessary.  That sounds like the setting
    that will use UI automation the least.

    

    You don't have to worry about changing the setting.  It will either
    help matters or it won't.  You don't even have to go back into
    advanced settings to change it back.  If you haven't shut down and
    restarted NVDA, just use the command control NVDA key r to return to
    the previous setting.  It restores the saved configuration.

    

    If you think the problem begain with a specific version of NVDA, the
    fastest and easiest way to find out if you can stop the problem by
    using an earlier version is to run an earlier version by selecting
    the run option when you run the installer.  It will run as though it
    were a portable version and you can test it with Word.

    

    Someone else can tell you how to get the older version you want to
    test with.  They are all available.

    

    then, if Word performs as you wish with that earlier version, create
    a portable version and use it whenever you want and the installed
    current version whenever you want.

    

    GeneI should add that control NVDA r is the desktop keyboard setting.  I
    haven't checked the laptop keyboard setting.

    

    GeneIt’s ctrl nvda R on the laptop side of things.  And pressing that 3 times will factory reset nvda which can help, don’t do it unless you have to however.  Try tye UI trick in advanced to see if that works, I f not you might tha ve to fully uninstall and reinstall NVDA. Good luck.If you use the factory reset option, that doesn't lose your saved
    configuration.  If you reset to factory settings, then use control
    NVDA key r once will return you to the previous settings, the ones
    you were using before the factory settings came up.  But if you shut
    down the computer or shut down NVDA while you are using factory
    settings, you will lose all your settings.  When using factory
    settings and at other times, any time NVDA closes for any reason
    unless you change default behavior will save the current
    configuration you are using.  So if you are using factory settings,
    anything that closes NVDA will save the factory settings as the
    current configuration and you will lose all your previously made
    settings.

    

    That is one reason I said that this behavior, automatic saving of
    settings on close should not be the default and that it should
    require the user to cause this to happen.  

    

    I had not thought about that, used the factory settings option, shut
    down the computer, and lost every setting I had previously made.

NVDA 2022.2 and Vocalizer Driver Version 5 5 messages,"Hi all.


I was on vacation the last days and so i don't know, if there are new compatible drivers for the vocalizer drivers for NVDA 2022.2. Does anyone know more about that?


And one more question. Isn't there something like an automatic update feature for those things? I find it really hard to always keep track of these things.


Thanks for help.


Regards

DanielHello!


NVDA 2022.2 is not a add-on breaking compatibility version...

If you mean Vocalizer-Expressive from Tiflotecnia, the last driver is version 3.1.7 and it is compatible with NVDA 2022.1 and beyond...

      In Excel 2019, NVDA does not read text when selecting font, font
      style, font size  in Format Cell dialog, even type, or use arrow
      key to select. I'm teaching Excel for about 5 students who use
      NVDA, and we all have this problem with 2022.2, and 2022.3beta2.

This is a known issue as reported here: https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/11504
Note that in that issue (and in my testing just now), with the focus in say the font edit, you can arrow and it will read - the issue is with it not being able to read any text which is selected in those dialogs in Excel.

NVDA Add-Ons - About Updating 9 messages,"Is there any way to have all incompatible add-ins automatically updated or do you have to update them one at a time.


Thanks,

DannyIf the add-ons are part of the community add-ons, and you have the Add-On Updater add-on installed, when compatible versions become available you will be notified and you go through the standard process to update.

If they are third-party add-ons, then you have to take care of it yourself.  This means, of course, for each third-party add-on individually.

You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.
     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedIf you install the Add-on Updater add-on it will check for any available updates for you and then you can choose to install them when you're ready.  This only works for add-ons that are on the official NVDA page, so if you're using the Codefactory voices, for instance, it won't catch that.

SteveDo you have the add-on updater? That will help youI do, and love that thing. I hope though it will update disabled add ons. I know that was not meant at me but take care anyway.Hi,

Two things:


Add-on Updater will update disabled add-ons (do not confuse this with incompatible add-ons). An add-on update will be shown if: there is an actual update (version differences) and the add-on is seen as compatible with the NVDA version you have.
As for add-ons mentioned in recent thread such as Speech History (see a different thread on that add-on), all I can say is that a birdy told me that significant events are on the horizon (shhh, not here).

The audio would need to be a nice sine wave. Parameters like words per minute, inter-character, word, and sentence spacing, and the frequency of the tone could all be adjustable. Other then that, it would just spew out whatever would normally go to your speech synthesizer. That would be a real boon to people trying to learn the code. Make me depend on it to read an email or two, or something else of interest a day, and I’d get faster in a hurry out of a combination of necessity and frustration. (grin) ChrisWhat is the point of this though, given that there are now CW mores pieces of software out there to receive and transmit it?

I guess it might be nice to send word files over CW, but you don't really need nvda to do that. Remember a lot of Morse is abbreviations these days due to the slowness if its human read. I cannot imagine how frustrating having a screenreader outputting in Morse might be.

There are many faster digital modes if you really want to broadcast the text, as I'm sure you are aware.

You know how slow that would be? For example, a very fast CW output would be 60 words per minute (60 WPM.)  Now just imagine doing this: to get an idea of just how slow that 'fast CW' transmission would be.  Count to your self: one one thousand
two one thousand
three one thousand and then at that pace, start speaking normal length words such as
'Hi
Joe
How
are
you?
I
m
fine
thank
you.'

and so on.

See what I mean?

Besides, CW is only used now of days for station IDs within commercial radio land services and on the ham bands. The military has quit using it years ago. ""--

I do remember dos ones, and even some that could key a transmitter using one of the handshake lines in a serial or printer port, so no need for tones. Of course decoders also existed on the older machines via a cassette port and later on on handshaking lines again. Many modern transceivers have all of this stuff built in to their software and all you need as a keyboard. Hampod I believe do a device to give the controls of many transceivers a voice and all under control of a few buttons.
Not my end of the ship but I have listened to discussions about such stuff. Brian

Another idea somebody had was a kind of push on finger cover with tiny electrodes that gave tiny shocks to the fingertips to emulate Braille. I can tell you now this does not actually work, since the shocks  mutually merge together destroying the pattern. However maybe this thread should go to chat now.

NVDA Crashing when using VLC Media Player 4 messages,"Hi all, As the subject indicates, NVDA crashes when opening a media file in VLC portable. Steps to reproduce:Launch VLC;Press <ctrl+o> to bring up the open files dialog;NVDA crashes;Bringing up narrator works without any issue.Press <ctrl+alt+n> launches NVDA once more.If you place focus back into the open dialog, NVDA crashes once more. I have run Narrator and it has no problems. Expected results:NVDA should read the open dialog without any crashing. Versions:VLC Portable  3.0.17.4 VetinariNVDA 2022.1Windows Version 21H2 (OS Build 19044.1706) Thanks.Mr. Deenadayalan MoodleyHi all, I think I tracked down the problem to the VLC nvda-addon.  If I disable it, then NVDA works as it should.  As soon as I enable the addon, then the problem seems to raise its head.  Thanks.Good morning,
I just had a look at our issues, and can't see anything like you are describing: https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues?q=is%3Aissue+vlc+is%3Aopen
If you have just updated or installed NVDA, have you restarted the PC since?  If not, try that first.
Are you using any add-ons for NVDA?  If so, if you restart NVDA with them disabled, does it make a difference?  Press NVDA+Q, then down arrow to ""Restart with add-ons disabled"" and press enter.
If you can set NVDA's log level to debug (in general settings) and then restart with add-ons disabled, could you please recreate the issue and then send me a copy of your log offlist please?
Kind regards

NVDA Dictionary Files 8 messages,". . . can they be backed up and can they be edited manually to allow for the rearrangement of the order of entries?

Over time I have put quite a few regex entries into my default dictionary as various questions have come up.  Since NVDA's dictionary processor does not stop processing once the first dictionary match is made, but does the replacement then chugs merrily along the rest of the dictionary entries, it is entirely possible for a later dictionary entry to interfere with the results of an earlier substitution in ways one might not initially expect.

I would love to be able to strip my dictionary down to a single entry for testing purposes, but not lose all the other stuff I have.  If these are stored in a text-based format, it should be simple to copy them and simple to edit whether it's to rearrange order, strip out entries, etc.

Since the dictionary manager does not have the ability to rearrange order, nor to turn specific items on/off for processing, I'd like to be able to do that myself when the occasion requires.  This is not something the average user would likely be doing often, but I have to believe that there are a number of heavy-duty NVDA testers and NVDA developers (whether core code or add-ons) that read here who have had the same need.

If a manual method exists to back up the dictionary files, and to manually edit these so that large numbers of items can be deleted or moved in one fell swoop, please share.

The difference between a top-flight creative man and the hack is his ability to express powerful meanings indirectly.
         ~ Vance Packardyes, it is possible to edit the dictionary files manually. They are located in AppData/Roaming/NVDA/speechDicts. The default dictionary is default.dic and any voice dictionaries you might have are in folders under the name of the synth.

One issue I found tricky to figure out was the flags to indicate options like for Type: anywhere or whole word only or regular expression, and for case sensitive or not. You can figure this out by looking at a dictionary entry and seeing how it is in the relevant dictionary file. Then change an option such as Type Anywhere and change it to whole word Only, then look at how the dictionary file has changed. I can't remember off the top of my head, but I think the numbers range from 0 to 2 for the Type option.

The last entry I added to my default dictionary appears like this in my default.dic file:

#Welsh town
Hirwaun    Heerwine    1    0

The #Welsh Town is the optional comment you can enter in the dictionary manager.
Then comes the text followed by the way you want it pronounced. Then come the flags for Type and Case Sensitive.

One thing that is interesting and has changed since the last time I edited a dictionary file manually, is that the entries are not comma-separated anymore ... they are separated by four spaces. 

Hope this helps :)

Gilesthe difference in how entries are separated may well mean that
    backed up dictionaries from earlier versions of NVDA won't work if
    you place them in new versions.  

    

    I backed up some dictionaries from old versions but it appears that
    if I want to use them in new versions, I likely won't be able to.

    

    GeneGiles,

Thanks very much.  Your answer reminded me that, at some point, I know I've asked about this before and it may very well have been you that answered.  
Here are two entries from my current default dictionary:
--

unchecky un-checky 0 2
#Mathematical Prime when there is a single letter with an apostrophe following
(\b[a-zA-Z])' \1 prime 0 1
--
The first is a simple whole-word replacement, with no associated comment, and the individual columns are in the following order, and are TAB separated:
Pattern  Replacement String  Case-Sensitivity-Indicator  Type

Case-Sensitivity-Indicator is 0 when case sensitivity is off and 1 when it's on.
Type is:   0 - Anywhere , 1 - Regular Expression, 2 - Whole Word

The second is a regular expression match where I also have a comment, and as you noted when a comment is present it is placed above the line with the above noted columns and prefixed with a pound sign/number sign/hash.

I have never used an Anywhere type match because it is so fraught, so I had to add one just to make sure that the type indicator would, indeed, be zero for this type of match.

This makes it very easy to create specific ""testing variants"" of a dictionary, which is what I have need to do on occasion.  Given the way NVDA processes the dictionary I sometimes need to strip out anything but what I'm trying to test to determine whether there are what I'll call ""substitution of substitution"" situations going on, since dictionary processing does not stop upon first match, but continues after the substitution has been done on that match for the remaining dictionary entries.  This can lead to some very interesting results, and I know that Quentin very kindly illustrated this, vividly, some time back when I was asking about dictionary processing.

Just run them through a global find and replace using TAB as the replacement for comma.  While that may screw up a comment or two that has no effect on dictionary processing and should fix the lines that were once comma separated.

Just based on memory the values used for the case sensitivity indicator and the type have never varied from what they are now, nor would they have any need to have done so.

         ~ Vance PackardThat's good.  Thanks.

    

    GeneThat is odd, I thought they used tab, but then its a while since I looked. Maybe some kind of simple substitution in notepad search and replace might convert them to spaces. There do seem to be some backup dictionaries in my folders, and I do not recall putting them there.
Another item in that folder appears to be the file created when you edit the spoken symbols as I do, so any you change or change the verbosity settings of, end up in a file in that folder as well.

NVDA Malfunctions In Read-Only Text Boxes In Google Chrome When In Focus Mode 10 messages,"In Google Chrome running on Windows 10 Home Edition, NVDA only announces the first character of whatever text is present when in focus mode and using the arrow keys to navigate by character inside read-only text boxes. For example, if the text box contains the word “Hello,” pressing the left or right arrow keys just results in NVDA saying “H.” Similar behavior occurs in Microsoft Edge except NVDA says the word “blank” instead of the first character in the text box. This suggests it may be a broader issue with Chromium browsers. In Firefox, NVDA functions normally in read-only text boxes. I’ve also opened a GitHub ticket for this issue which can be found here:https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/13745 I searched existing closed and open issues prior to opening a new one and didn’t find a previous report of this issue. Please refer to my bug report for more details and background. Thanks,LukeI can reproduce this in regular text edit boxes. I was trying to search  for something n trail head and I typed in “quote” and heard “q” and that’s about it. I could not arrow, I could not read by line. Nothing. I tried the menu trick but that didn’t work.Can you provide a link to a page with a read only edit field?  I
    don't recall sites that have them.  I probably just read the content
    and don't pay attention much if the field says read only.  I would
    ordinarily read text where I am not writing in browse mode.

    

    I just tried the Google search field and I had no problem but that
    isn't a read only edit field.

    

    GeneHi Gene. If you check out the issue page I linked to, I provide steps for how to reproduce the issue. Let me know if that works for you. Thanks!I'm not sure what you are working with.  It appears to be some sort
    of source code.  When I go to the page, I hear something like
    welcome to and then the name of an editor.

    

    However, it appears to me that NVDA is working as expected.  A read
    only edit field is read only, you can't write in it.  Focus mode
    doesn't let you move in a web page unless you are in a field that
    allows movement, such as an edit field that allows you to write when
    in focus mode.  When in structures like combo boxes, you can move as
    well or in a list of radio buttons.  But the structure on the actual
    web page must allow you to move and I would think that by
    definition, a read only edit field wouldn't.  There is no cursor
    provided in the underlying page for a read only field, I would
    think.

    

    GeneHowever in focus mode if you curser through the field you should be able to read in it.  I’ll have to check the next time I publish a youtube video, as that has a read only link. I was going to show a page to a we transfer file  I had already uploaded to see if we could get it to brake but sadly I cannot.Hello Jean, JAWS behaves differently in that regard. It will let you move to a read only edit box by pressing E then enter to enter focus mode. You can then use cursor keys to read the read only edit box, you can even perform a control A and Control C, and it will copy only the contents of the read only edit box. I think NVDA should allow this. All the best
SteveThis appears to have nothing to do with NVDA.  I tried reading the
    read only edit field using both JAWS and NVDA using Chrome.  In both
    cases, when in focus mode in NVDA and in forms mode in JAWS, you
    couldn't move properly through the field using the left and right
    arrow keys on the site given as an example in the issue on Github,
    which is linked to in the original message, at the bottom of the
    quoted messages.  

    Here is the link:

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_input_readonly

    

    In Firefox, you can move properly.  Also, in Chrome, regardless of
    screen-reader, you can select the text and copy it to the clipboard
    using control a to select.  I didn't try selecting it in Firefox
    moving with the arrow keys.  

    

    GeneThis sounds like what occurs in thenavigation modes in nvda, but at a more keyboard intensive level. This might mean an add on might be able to get a short cut to do such a thing.

in the display name field.The issue opened by Mr. Robinette was closed with this note, ""This seems like intended behaviour for Chromium. Consider opening an issue against Chromium.""

That's the long and the short of it.  Any screen reader can only work with what is exposed to it to work with.  This specific situation appears to stem from what Chromium-based browsers allow the screen reader access to.

It does make me wonder, though, why NVAccess would not actually follow-up with opening such an issue.  I know from my years ""in the coding biz"" that issues opened by entities tend to get a lot more, and more immediate, attention than those opened by end users.  A pecking order exists.

NVDA Message 3 messages,"Hi All, I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. I am using a computer running Windows 10 with the latest version of NVDA. I am using a Ubantu distribution with Visual Studio and for the most part, things are working well. One issue I run into is that if I am in the terminal and type commands, I sometimes get a message from NVDA indicating there is too much output to announce. Generally, NVDA will read information once I type a command and press enter. I can also review terminal output using the up and down arrow keys with the control key. I haven’t found a way to move focus to the beginning of the most recent output from the terminal but can at least read the messages in reverse order from bottom to top. This is inefficient but I don’t know of a way around it. I am having a related issue where NVDA will stop speaking if I type numerous commands and then press alt plus tab to open other applications like Chrome. Then NVDA sometimes won’t announce anything until I wait a few seconds or press alt and tab several times. If I am in Chrome, there might be silence if I am reviewing a web page containing output from the JavaScript Jasmine framework. I wonder what is happening. Thanks,DanDan,

I can't speak at all to the Chrome issue, and I have a suggestion with regard to the WSL output.  If you know a command is likely to output far more lines of output than any screen reader is likely to handle gracefully, redirect the output to a file then open the file afterward for review.

    You can test in that way if the program can run.

    GeneYour desktop shortcut is for an installed copy of NVDA.

If you are trying to run a portable version, that shortcut will not work.

Do you have NVDA installed?Howard Traxler wrote:

Thanks Gene, trying to start NVDA from the start menu simply shuts down the running portable version and stops without ...We need to see what is failing when you attempt to start NVDA.

Try to start it, as Gene suggested, then, when it fails, attach the file at %temp%\nvda.log to an email to me directly (luke@...). You're not able to send it to the list directly, or I'd just suggest you do that.

LukeIf you have installed it, and answered the questions about starting on
start-up, then it should work. I am aware that on some machines it can take a
significant time, and if the  sound drivers do not load first, then nvda
seems to not speak, since the log shows it has found no sound device.
It does not depend on the desktop shortcut to run, but inserts itself into
the windows start up queue.
Do you hear anything  working sound wise?. I guess you might wish to launch
a portable copy after start up and see whether it works. I assume it does
from your comment. So if you shut down the portable copy and use the
keyboard shortcut to start the installed one, does it give the rising tones
etc and other sounds, and then just not speak?.
This indicates it did not find the hardware on start up at windows start up
and set it to silence.

So I really cannot think of any other reason not mentioned already in this
thread.

      started the first time I tried but doesn't any more.  So, I must

      That shortcut shuts down the portable version and nothing else

      what happens.
    

    
    HowardOne thing to check is whether NVDA is running but you aren't getting
    speech.  When a screen-reader stops speaking, with no other
    information, it can't be assumed if the screen=-reader has stopped
    or if the synthesizer has stopped working.

    

    Run narrator, control Windows key enter, that is hold both control
    and enter and press enter.

    

    Once it is running, run NVDA.

    

    After it should be running, try opening the NVDA menu with numpad
    insert n.  Does the NVDA menu open?

    

    If so, the problem may be with the synthesizer or synthesizer
    settings in some way.

    Close the menu with escape, then Open the speech dialog using
    control NVDA key v.

    Tab around to volume and see what it is.  Raise it if necessary,
    then actavate the ok button.

    

    If there is nothing to change activate cancel.  

    Then open the synthesizer dialog with control NVDA key s.  You will
    be in a combo box.  Select a synthesizer, try e-speak.  Move to it
    and press enter.

    

    Do you now have speech from both screen-readers?  I said to try
    e-speak assuming you weren't using it already.  If you already are,
    try something else like the one core voices.

NVDA and Hashtags 16 messages,"First, this is a purely lazy post on my part, as I so seldom use or read material that actually contains hashtags.

Does NVDA read something (or at least something that is not purely numeric) that is preceded by a pound/number sign (#) as, ""Hashtag {insert what follows the # here}?""

Given the ubiquity of hashtags, and given that the only context I can think of for # to be read as number sign or just number is if what comes after is entirely numeric, e.g., #32.  I'd expect 32# to be read as 32 pound or 32 pound sign due to the position of the sign and its historical use for pounds when it follows a numeric.  But I'd expect something like #MeToo to be read as, ""hashtag me too.""  Is it?

         ~ Vance PackardWhile I don’t have any new surprises to add I wanted to rule out Acapela just in case some synthesizers make exceptions for the hashtag symbol. I couldn’t check in my initial test as the addon wasn’t consistently appearing in the list of
 voices and I needed to reinstall the engine. It also says “number” regardless of placement.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgBy the way, anyone who wants to try out a complex regular expression to get hashtags to announce as ""hashtag"" followed by whatever follows the pound sign EXCEPT if everything after the pound sign is a string of digits, then do the following (this presumes NVDA is already open):

1. Hit NVDA + N, P, D, D to open the default dictionary manager.
2. Hit ALT + A to activate the Add button or navigate to the Add button and activate it.
3. In the Add Dictionary Entry dialog, in the noted edit boxes enter what follows that box name exactly ignoring the space that separates the name from the content:
          Pattern (#)([^0-9]\w+|[0-9]+(?=[a-zA-Z]+)\w*)
          Replacement hashtag \2
          Comment Speak hashtags as hashtags
          Leave the case sensitive checkbox unchecked.  Note:  when using regular expression matches this should ALWAYS remain unchecked.  The regex deals with case.
          Type Radio button for Regular Expression should be activated.
4. Activate the dialog's OK button.
5. Activate the dictionary manager's OK button.

You're done.

Now, for the other regex gurus out there, below are the test strings I used and NVDA is still not pronouncing the ones that start with numbers correctly.  I can't for the life of me figure out why, as I strip the number sign from what's sent to the synth, so why I'd get ""number"" said, ever, eludes me.  The first and third do as I'd expect and say hashtag followed by the text. The fourth does as I expect and is not captured and, thus, gets announced as number.  But the second and fifth still get ""number"" followed by the number part then the rest of the text said as a unit.  Why?  [And I'm fine with this discussion occurring off list, as it would be a snoozefest for those who don't wish to dig in to regex construction.  Also, I use the website regex101 for testing what a given regex matches with Python regex syntax as the chosen one.]

Rui,

Thanks, and this is what I would expect.  Might I ask what synth you're using?

I should know better than not to suspect a synth-driven difference, and I need to test the same strings sans the pound sign in front just to see what Microsoft David, which is what I'm using, does when they're not prefixed.

      escreveu:I’ve always spoken it as number, not hash tag. I dun no if this would be a good idea in the end.Hi,

Not all social media platforms and languages use the same hashtag rules as noted in the regular expression. The common hashtag format (letters, numbers, underscores) works best with Latin character set but doesn't work well with languages such as Chinese.

While an argument can be made in that screen readers should have advanced text processing capabilities such as hashtag announcements, I (personally) believe that it is really up to text to speech engines to define rules for these and give users a chance to edit speech dictionary entries. A screen reader is an information processing specialist in that it will consume whatever text information it can find. The job of actually announcing text in certain ways is really up to speech engines and humans to decide - screen readers can influence parts of that process, but it is really up to people to decide what to do with whatever they heard/read/saw.

Joseph,

There is a bit of circular logic at work here (and on my my part, too).  If what one hears/reads/sees is not clear, then deciding what to do with it becomes fraught.

I will not even attempt to account for formats in languages which I do not speak, nor should I.  But the understanding, in several contexts, of the hashtag is really not difficult.

Whether the screen reader does it, or the synth does it is really not something that I care about.  In fact, since I don't use them it's not particularly relevant to me, personally, at all.  But it is relevant to how something that is supposed to present text to a user who can only listen to it works is relevant, and being contextually appropriate is very relevant indeed.  There is no way that #MeToo makes more sense as number MeToo than as hashtag MeToo.

Well, you're talking about something entirely different, which is what a given language locality calls individual symbols.  I always knew the Pound Sterling sign was said as pound(s) when referring to money, but I didn't know that the number sign (US) was referred to as hash.  But even hash is about the symbol, while hashtag is about the symbol and what follows it.

In any case, at this point those who may want hashtags announced as hashtags have a regex to do it and step by step instructions for adding same to the dictionary.  It's an option one can use, or not.

But as dictionaries (as in the real ones with definitions of words) change as the language does, it seems to me that it makes sense for synths to try to keep up with ""the prevailing winds"" of changes that appear to have become permanent, regardless of what those are.  Too often they don't.

But when it comes to symbol reading, I'll take ""Bang"" over ""exclamation point,"" and ""tick,"" over ""single quote,"" just for efficiency's sake. When going character by character through content I prefer the shortest comprehensible identifier for a character, as the process is already tedious enough as is.

Can anybody point me to resources on the web that confirm this?  What do you mean by “actually be”?How do you think the screenreader should identify the control type and function? Are you a blind person who uses a screenreader regularly, or a sighted person who doesn’t rely on the screenreader feedback? Are you familiar with WCAG ""Success Criteria""?If so, these may be related to your situation.1.3.1: Info and Relationships.2.4.6: Headings and Labels.3.3.2: Labels or Instructions4.1.2: Name, Role and ValueHi Marc,
    from the perspective of someone who uses NVDA daily, everything
      you described is expected behavior.
    

    
    I'm not an expert on web certifications, but have you looked into
      the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [0]? For example, section
      4.1.2 [1] describes the need for UI components to have a name,
      role, and value that can be determined and set programmatically.
      Also, section 2.1.2 [2] may also be of interest to you, which
      describes keyboard traps, such as those caused by embedded
      applications/modals and the need of having a convenient way of
      jumping out of them with a keyboard or with a button.
    

    
    Note that it may be worth testing each screen reader with each of
      the browsers; some browsers may give different behaviors with
      different screen readers. For example, the Free PBX [3] web GUI
      works better with Firefox and NVDA; Chrome does not show all the
      controls on the page.
    Hope this is helpful.

    
    Best,
    Carlos

    [3]: https://www.freepbx.org/Hi Carlos. Do you do Website accessibility testing and remediation work? I am just getting started in that field, so I hope I didn’t lead Mark astray with my suggestions. It sounds like you have a better handle on WCAG than I do at this point. 😁Hi Chris,
    Thanks, but I don't. WCAG is usually fresh in my mind because
      people I know run web accessibility-related questions passed me
      every once and a while. :-)Yes I am a daily screen reader user and am familiar with WCAG. I wholeheartedly agree with both of you that form controls should announce the type of control, the state of the control, and the label on the control. Your references to WCAG guidelines are spot on.

My main question can be boiled down to this. If I navigate with arrow keys to the control, it is announced by NVDA as ""Button Close"" but If I navigate to the control with the tab key or the letter B, NVDA announces as ""Close Button.""
 
The engineer has informed me that it was coded to meet WCAG guidelines and another colleague believes that this is the expected behavior. I do not like to necessarily make comparisons to other assistive tech but in this case I do think it is relevant. Jaws and VoiceOver both announce the control as ""Close Button"" regardless of how focus is navigated to the control.

Was just wondering if that sounds correct? If so, is there any documentation to inform others on how NVDA handles form controls, specifically buttons.

ThanksBut you are still getting all the information.  I haven't compared
    other screen-readers but I believe this is expected behavior in
    NVDA.  JAWS allows you to set whether you hear the kind of control
    before other information or other information first.  It is not
    determined by the web page.  

    

    IN NVDA, if I tab to a link that is visited, I hear the link spoken
    before visited.  If I up or down arrow to a visited link, I hear
    visited link before the link is spoken.

    

    In other words, these variations are screen-reader variations and
    aren't determined by the web page.

    

    GeneHi all,

Specifically, the answer lies with how NVDA treats text information (and formatting) as you navigate by character/word/line. While I can't go into details without risking finals study schedule, all I can say (at this time) is that NVDA will look at formatting information as you use arrow keys to navigate text in browse mode context. The reason why you hear ""close button"" when you press Tab key versus ""button close"" as you press arrow keys has to do with the fact that the former responds to possible system focus changes and the latter is a reaction to browse mode cursor location changes.

In answer to the big question posed: this is screen reader specific. You can in fact tell JAWS to announce control type (that's what it is called) before label, and NVDA does so differently based on context you are in. I can go into details upon request (either next week or in July).

Cheers,

JosephThis is strictly anecdotal from personal observation, but I've
      grown to associate focus vs brows mode based on the way controls
      are spoken. For example, brows mode usually prepends the control
      type before the name for most things like buttons and links. As
      far as I'm aware, the screen reader chooses how to present that
      data, not the web developer.
    

    
    It's been a while since I used JAWS, but I remember it behaving
      similarly when navigating using NVDA's equivalent of brows mode VS
      just tabbing around in it's focus mode equivalent.",998,28,0.028056112,0.028056112,1,1045,65,19.19,55.97,36.66,23.75,21.34,76.46,58.09,47.75,10.81,5.93,3.44,0,2.11,0,0.1,4.88,12.44,6.51,2.78,12.44,8.04,3.06,7.46,1.05,13.78,4.4,2.01,3.35,0.29,0.86,2.39,18.47,0.77,17.51,4.21,4.69,1.34,3.25,0.38,5.36,0.1,1.91,1.53,0.38,0.77,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,0,7.75,4.11,0.48,0.48,0,0,2.68,3.64,0,0,0,0,2.11,0,0,2.11,2.39,0,0,2.3,0.1,0,0.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,0.1,0.1,0.1,3.73,6.41,0.86,0.57,4.31,0.48,0.57,0,2.39,1.91,5.17,1.53,0.67,0.48,0.19,0,0,23.54,7.27,4.5,0.86,0,1.24,9.67

NVDA and windows 11 21 messages,"Hi, I still haven't updated to windows 11 because of fears of it not working well as windows 10 and was curious if everyone else have updated to windows 11?

Thank you for any feedback on this. Hope this question is OK to ask on here.I've read a little about changes and new features in Windows 11. 
    Some people may want this or that feature.  There is nothing I've

    Yes, I bought a new machine that has 11 already installed.  I'm
      in the process of migrating all my stuff onto it.  I find it at
      least as good and friendly as ten.  Setup has been going well with
      the help of some of the guys on these mailing lists.  Without them

      smoothe.

    
    

    
    HowardI haven’t updated to windows 11 yet. I don’t know if I’ll be able to because I bought this computer in 2016.   Sent from Mail for WindowsHi, No, I have not upgraded to win11 yet.I think I’ll do it in the fall, after the major 22h2 version is released.Hi Rosemarie,If your pc has an intel processor, it willnot run win 11.The oldest processor that win11 will work with with is the 8th generation I core cpu, which was released in 1017.That’s fine.Micro soft will support win10 until October of 2025.Of course, win10 will continue to work after this time,  it will just not be officially supported.Oh my, that should be 2017.hi all,actually, I have also not updated to windows 11 yet,I was looking for some good feedback.Also, I got to know that there are changes in the main navigation and GUI.there are no major changes by the view of  new features,so, right now I dont have a plan to update.
best,Krit KediaI needed a new PC so I'm now on Windows 11 (and for the same reason I can't give you a commentary on the upgrading experience or on how it runs on the same hardware).  Day to day, it works fine and isn't so different from Windows 10.  Many of the changes are ""under the hood"" with things like improved security.  There is a new (returned?) Widgets feature - basically a way of providing ""live"" information like news and weather without you needing to go into anything.  To be honest I've never really played with it too much.  The main day to day difference is the start menu.  I'm not sure why, but (personal opinion) Microsoft seem to be intent on making the start menu less useable with every version of Windows :)  You can still get to ""all apps"" for instance, but now it takes four keystrokes.  Basically either pin things you want to the taskbar, or use start menu search (press the Windows button, type what you want, eg ""word"" or ""security"" or ""resume"" (you can search for programs, settings, documents or just on the web, as you could in Windows 10).
If you're buying a new PC, then definitely get Windows 11.  If you're unsure about upgrading and don't need new hardware, then Windows 10 will continue to be supported until 2025, so you don't need to make a decision yet.  It does seem to work fine, although of course depending on exactly what programs you are using etc, your experience may differ.

While what you say is entirely true and correct, there are other factors to consider.  We're now past the 6 months after initial release and all indications, including yours, are that Windows 11 is quite stable and has not proven to be any more problematic than Windows 10 or 8.1.

One thing that constantly gets overlooked, and that I've had to deal with on these groups and in real life, is that there is a period where ""everyone who's updated is in information sharing mode, and active information sharing,"" and this tends to be in the first year after a major release.  Answers tend to come fast and furious, to everyone's benefit.  After that period most who've upgraded or gotten a new machine with Windows 11 will be in coast mode, often not remembering how they accomplished something or that they even did something to make changes at all.

Then you also get into the fact that information that was 100% accurate when written can and does go stale fairly quickly, and then you have to plow through lots of information with an eye on when it was written, and whether it's still accurate multiple months later.  Windows As A Service, even though Feature Updates have now been slowed to once a year, is still a relatively rapidly changing environment.

Take the above into consideration if you are thinking about upgrading to Windows 11 or buying a new computer with Windows 11 on it.  We're no longer at the ""bleeding edge"" period and there are some advantages to being in the same boat with a lot of others.  Later on, you're more in your own rowboat rather than on a ship with many, many others.

By the way, due to my ""hardware situation"" I can't upgrade, and as a support tech I'm already running into certain situations where my knowledge of Windows 11 is behind what's current as a result.  And given the price of new computers with the worldwide chip shortage, I'm in no hurry to purchase a new computer.

The difference between a top-flight creative man and the hack is his ability to express powerful meanings indirectly.
         ~ Vance PackardAll true Brian, I must admit I was mostly thinking of those who either find the process of updating intimidating or just don't want to spend the time doing it if they don't have to.  And I can appreciate that, it does take a good amount of time.  I haven't done the upgrade on an existing machine to know how smoothly it runs.  Actually what I can say is with so much stuff stored on the cloud - OneDrive, Google Drive, etc, and passwords stored on the cloud - getting setup on a new machine is actually less painful these days than it used to be.  It still took say half a day of doing little else, a couple of days of working, but regularly having to stop and install a program I'd forgotten about, or retrieve something from a backup or off the old machine I'd forgotten about,  and then every now and then now I have to chase something.  But otherwise, yes, everything is running smoothly.
I would also say, since Windows 11 has been out for awhile now and is quite stable and accessible, if I had a Windows 10 machine which could take it, I'd rather upgrade now than in three years time - as you say, everyone else has been doing it recently, so whatever problem you run into, someone has probably worked out how to get around it recently enough to remember and be able to recount it to you - and if you do it now, you'll just have what you have now to move - in three years time, you'll have all that AND everything from that three years :)  And you'll be three years older!

In the vast majority of cases, very smoothly.  It's pretty much like a typical Feature Update.  My general advice is to kick it off when you're about to retire for the night (or at least not planning to use your computer), make sure you get through the initial questions and answers, and there aren't many, and walk away when you're told the upgrade is in progress.

In way more than 9 times out of 10, the next morning you're at the login screen for Windows 11.

         ~ Vance PackardHi all,

And I can assure you that NVDA developers are constantly looking for ways to improve support for Windows 11 (including the upcoming feature update). Due to hard disk crash a few months ago, I have switched to a laptop running Windows 11 as my primary machine, but I keep Windows 10 virtual machines handy just in case I need to test changes on older operating systems.

To answer an earlier question: if Windows 11 is deemed compatible, you'll see a control named ""download and install now"" in Settings/Update and security/Windows update (on Windows 10).

As for feature updates: the next updates for both Windows 10 and 11 are being tested by Windows Insiders. Perhaps the biggest change in upcoming Windows 11 feature update is tweaks to Settings app. At the moment Microsoft and some Insiders are testing some exciting features coming in future updates.

Cheers,

JosephHi all,

I can confirm David's and Brian's observation.

A few more things to consider:


Feature update process in Windows 10 versus 11: while it wasn't the case until recently, Microsoft is using an enablement package approach for recent Windows 10 updates. This is why when updating from say, Windows 10 Version 21H1 to 21H2, it is done quickly as all the changes for the upcoming feature update become part of cumulative updates which will be turned on after installing the feature update. This is not the case when upgrading to Windows 11 as you are effectively telling Windows to do an in-place upgrade (replacing system files) provided that the hardwaer is compatible (this takes a while longer). While many people will get to do this once a year, there are folks who do this more frequently (daily for some Microsoft engineers, weekly for Windows Insiders subscribed to dev channel).
As David pointed out, you can start Narrator while the upgrade is in progress. Upgrading from Windows 10 to 11 (or for that matter, for Windows Insiders subscribed to dev channel) is roughly divided into five steps: checking and downloading a new update (for Windows Insiders, builds), unpacking the new system files (technically a new Windows image), restarting and replacing system files, restarting again and transferring apps and settings, and final sign-in process and setup. You can fire up Narrator through all five phases, whereas you can use NVDA in all phases except steps 3 and 4.


Personally, I feel both excitement and dread whenever a new dev channel Insider Preview build is released, but that's for another time.

Cheers,

JosephFor those with an iOS or Android device I forgot to mention another very important tool in my toolbox that I can have available for those times when even Narrator may not fire up with the standard keyboard shortcut. I’m referring to text
 recognition apps, such as Envision AI or Seeing AI. Having these apps on standby can really help when you want to read what’s on your screen when other screen readers just aren’t available.

NVDA chat Key echo 11 messages,"Hi,
How many people use key echo when typing in word? I was cruious how many used key echo, word echo, and no echo.
Thanks
ChrisI don’t use any echo.  I can’t stand listening to it, so the less it speaks, the better I like it, and that goes for any screenreader and any speech.  I just want it to talk when I want to know something.  Pam. Sent from Mail for WindowsWhy typing in Word specifically?  I'm typing this e-mail and that's
    just as much writing as if I were writing in Word.  I use key echo
    when writing because it informs me of errors that I can correct as
    they are made.  This isn't necessary, I check messages before I send
    them but I want to know if I make an error when I make it and
    correct it then.  Using letter echo doesn't always tell me when an
    error is made for one reason or another but it helps.

    

    If someone uses a synthesizer that is not responsive and the echo is
    too far behind the key press, using character echo becomes an
    impediment.  If I use Via Voice or Eloquence, the response is
    immediate.

    

    GeneI use no echo except in discord, I use word echo in that profile, only
because I've been having some odd ish issues in terms of words not typing
when I want them to be typed.Hi,
Thanks for all of your feedback.
I just wanted to know because I like to write and I've used word echo and no echo. I was just curious what others did.
The reason I wasn't concerned about emails is because most emails aren't very long.
ChrisI use character echo! I like to hear every letter spoken as I type it! I am just lost if I only hear every word, for example! I fix my mistakes as I type! That is why I never use no echo! I would have a lot of little typoes to correct if I used no echo!Hi.  I use ""Speak typed characters"" in all of my NVDA profiles for the same reasons already discussed in this thread.  I also have my symbol level set to ""Most"".

LouiseI use letter, but have in the past tried word echo, but my brain has a problem processing it that way.

NVDA doesn’t honor verbosities settings when selecting text 6 messages,"I find that when I hold down shift and use the cursor keys to select text, NVDA doesn’t use the same verbosity settings as when I am just navigating around. For example, I’ve got a snippet of code in front of me now. I have NVDA set only to beep for indents, not announce them. This works as expected when I move about using the arrow keys, but when I hold down shift and use the up and down arrow keys to select text one line at a time, NVDA announces the tab characters. For heavily indented lines of code, it gets tedious to listen to this when I just want to hear the actual content of that line When I’m selecting text. Is there any way to control this?Hi Luke,
Are you using an add-on for this functionality?  The regular functionality with NVDA, if you have it set to report paragraph indent in NVDA's document formatting settings, is to report ""Left indent zero point five centimetres"" (or whatever your measurement unit is set to). ""--

      that? Also, is the setting set to tones only? It may be worth
      trying another editor just to be sure that it's not an

    - CarlosHi Luke

With symbol level on '""some"", I do not hear the beeps, but do not hear ""tab"" to be reported.
I can totally reproduce the issue with ""tab"" reported only if I set the symbol level on ""all"".

You may check NVDA's GitHub if a similar issue has already been reported; and if not, you should describe it in a new issue.

@Quentin:
The option considered here is ""Line indentation reporting"", not ""◦ Paragraph indentation (e.g. hanging indent, first line indent)"".

Cheers,


CyrilleCyrille, I think you're right; this sounds like a bug to me. Mine
      is set to most; that's probably why I didn't catch it when I tried
      it. I just set punctuation level to all and observed it announce
      the tab characters. I guess the bigger question is if it's
      intended behavior for NVDA to announce other white space
      characters other than the regular one (ascii code 0x20) with all
      being the punctuation setting.
    

    
    Luke, you may be able to change the tab entry in the
      punctuation/symbols pronunciation dialogue accessible in the NVDA
      preferences menu from all to character to only announce it if you
      move the cursor to the tab character. The word tab should filter
      down the list to only the relevant entry.
    

    
    - CarlosThank you for the replies, folks. I should have specified that I was noticing this behavior in Microsoft SQL Server management studio specifically but have observed it in other places as well. Using the speech dictionary to alter how it reads tabs is a great idea! I will give that a shot. Just to clarify too, there’s a difference in behavior when using the arrow keys without holding down shift versus using them while holding down shift, and the expected behavior, I would think, would be the same verbosity behavior whether or not text was being selected.

NVDA failed to install 40 messages,"Starting to use a computer that has been out of service for two or three years.

Ideas anyone?  Thanks.
HowardHi, Howard,

What version of windows are you using? If it's a much older version, then you'd have to use a much older version of NVDA.

Hope this helps.

RosemarieTry answering yes when UAC comes up.  Escape only closes UAC and
    doesn't allow the action it is asking about.  Alt y when the UAC
    prompt comes up and you want to answer yes.  Escape or alt n when
    you want to answer no.

    

    I think it is a very bad idea to disable a security feature such as
    UAC when it isn't necessary.

    

    GeneEven if its Windows  servicePack1, NVDA supports it.  If you try to
    install aversion that your operating system is incompatible with,
    you will get a message telling you that.  

    

    GeneI didn't hear anything about UAC nor a yes or no question.  Maybe an alt y at the time of lockup will do it.  I'll give it a try.

Thanks.
HowardYou were using the talking installer at that time.  That is running
    as though it were a portable version of NVDA.  When UAC comes up,
    portable NVDA won't read the message.  It may say something like
    secure desktop.  Answer y because according to your description, the
    UAC prompt has come up.

    

    GeneI should have said use alt y for yes.

    

    GeneWhen I do  windows plus R and at the run prompt, type winver, the answer is version 1803 and build 17134 something.  I've tried to find how to update windows but can't find it.  It wants to update my office 2003; and I know there's no update for that; but that's all it shows.  There must be a way to do this?
HowardIf you are still all the way back on Windows 10 Version 1803 then Windows Update has been broken on your machine for a very, very long time indeed.

I suggest you immediately follow these instructions, which based on what downloads now will get you to Windows 10 Version 21H2, which is the latest:
Performing a Windows 10 or 11 Repair Install or Feature Update Using the Windows ISO file
or, if you prefer, go to the Windows 10 Download Page, and trigger the Update Assistant using the Update Now button.

Something needs to be done, pronto, to fix your instance of Windows 10 and get it back on track as far as feature updates go.  Version 1803 has been out of support for quite a while now.

        ~ Joshua LiebmanThank you, yes.  This was a computer in my wife's play room which she seldom used; not for two or three years.  I will look at your instructions and see which way is easiest.  And hopefully I can get it done.

HowardBut if it hasn't been used for years, maybe there is something wrong.  Have you checked updates to see if any are shown to be installed?

Open the start menu, type update and press enter.  Let the information read.  If you don't hear anything about updates, let us know.

GeneHi


If you do not want the UAC screen to come up when installing nvda and some other programs he will need to do the following.

Press the windows key and in the search box type uac it should come up with a suggestion press the enter key on it.

The next screen that comes up you will need to Tab until you hear the slider it is set to 65 percent or around there change it to zero with the arrow keys left or right then tab down to ok then press the enter key.


It will reboot the pc if I remember right and the uac screen will not come up again. It can be turned back on by doing the same process except in the slider change from zero back to 65 percent or what ever it is.

hope it helps.


Gene nzI really object to disabling UAC.  While it can be defeated by some
    malware, I don't know how much, I see no reason to disable a layer
    of protection when all you have to do is issue the command alt y
    when UAC comes up.  Why disable a security utility when it is so
    easy to allow programs to be installed?  You are decreasing security
    for no advantage that means anything.

    

    GeneOK Gene, when you say start menu, are you refering to what happens when I press the windows key and get a search box?  I think that's what folks are calling the start menu.

I've got a few things to try right now; so I'm fixed for a while. I'm using the media creation tool to make an thunb drive update media.  When it's done, I'll take it downstairs and see if it updates the computer.

HowardYes.  I'm talking about doing that and typing in the windows start
    search menu, which is where you will be

    

    I'm suggesting you do what I suggest first.  You don't know if the
    computer isn't downloading updates.  If you check, you will know. 
    I'm not saying you shouldn't do other things if there is a problem
    but you don't know yet.  

    

    You are showing the old version of Windows because the computer
    hasn't finished updating itself.  That doesn't mean there is
    anything wrong.  You said the computer hasn't been used for a number
    of years.

    

    GeneYes, that’s what I do. I turn it off. Then once I install the program I want. Then I turn it back on and put it to 65 or whatever it is I have it at.  Sent from Mail for WindowsYes, if it hasn’t been used for years.

Either press Alt+Y, or turn on Narrator with Control+Windows+Enter, read the secure screen window, and do what it says.

Since you don't seem to be aware of this: when Windows needs higher security permissions than your user has, it brings up a UAC (User Account Control) prompt. That prompt runs as the system administrative user. It's what NVDA calls a ""secure screen"".
Since that is a different user then the one you're running as, that other user isn't running NVDA. That's why it doesn't talk, and you think it's locking up. But it's not locking up, it just isn't talking.

You either need to be able to handle that screen on auto-pilot, by pressing Alt+Y, or you need to enter a password for an admin level account, which probably requires speech to be successful at this stage. To get speech, you either have to install NVDA and have it run on secure screens (a chicken and egg problem in this case), or you need to run Narrator in the admin user account as I described.

You should try to finish installing NVDA before updating Windows, in case that isn't obvious.

Luke,

The following is hair-splitting, but I think it's important for users to understand exactly what's going on.  The vast majority of us who have a single user on a given machine have one that has administrative privilege.  But even if you do, things that actually require that privilege to be active will trigger UAC, because even accounts that have admin privilege are expected to grant its use consciously in more recent versions of Windows.  At one time, that wasn't the case, and if you did something that required admin privilege and were using an account that had admin privilege, it would just run.

Much of the reason for UAC is the way malware of various forms work, particularly as far as trying to install something.  It is possible to accidentally kick off a malware install you had no intention of actually doing, and when UAC prompts and you don't even recognize the thing it's prompting for, you just refuse to allow the changes to be made to your machine.  I once, a long time ago, had UAC save my bacon in precisely that way, and am thankful for it, as the ""trouble"" of having to confirm I wish to allow changes to be made to my machine by an installer I kicked off is just minimal.

You are correct, though, that if you happen to be running as a standard user, once UAC gets involved you will have to present credentials for another account that has administrative privilege before you can have any installer proceed.  And I use standard user accounts specifically to make it well-nigh impossible for users who have them to install anything or change any settings that are not user associated.

It is so much more work than just selecting yes, or pressing Alt+Y, at the periodic UAC prompt while installing something.

If you have NVDA set to run on secure screens (NVDA General settings), the dialogs will speak normally, and you can interact with them just fine.

From what you describe, it sounds like the issue is occuring when the spreadsheet tries to update itself.  I have a large spreadsheet which does that and basically it does freeze Excel while it is calculating, so you can't do anything - and that happens even if NVDA is not running.  I appreciate you said your spreadsheet was not so large, so I'm not sure, although it does sound basically the same.

      I have closed Excel and reopened it. In a new file, I have writen

      Yes, there are only few calculations, but the spreadsheet uses
      validation very much.

      There are no less than a thousand cells with list validations.
      Dispite having few calculations, perhaps validations, used in a

      If NVDA doesn't lead well with validations, I have a big problem
      since this is the spreadsheet of my real world.

Às 11:32 de 02/06/2022, Luciano de Souza escreveu:Quentin and Luciano,

I frequently encounter this problem with excel It has been happening during the past year especially!

I found a hint after a Google search that having the whole worksheet active can cause this problem.

There  are about one million rows in a complete worksheet. If you have a formula that has to check cells in the same column ( counting, for instance, the number of occurrences of a particular value) Excel has to search all one million cells in that column before it can return the resultant count. That alone can take a few moments to complete. If you have a formula that addresses multiple columns horizontally and vertically, this will multiply the cells to be examined and delay enormously.

I found that I could stop this happening if I deliberately deleted all the empty rows below my active data area. This meant that Excel had only to explore 200 or 300 cells instead of millions.

It I am copying data down a column of 200 rows, for example, I found it necessary to go to the bottom of the active column and copy the data down using control + d. This made sure that the formula did not go down to the million  rows. If the formula once copies down to the millionth cell, the whole lower portion of the worksheet is activated. It remains activated even if I delete the data that was copied down too far.
Excel must then explore all the rows in case there is other data somewhere in the column being worked on.

The trick is to move to the last row of valid data. Then copy all the cells below that last cell but only in that column (this is important!), . Then open the delete dialog using the application key and select ""delete entire row"". This effectively closes the entire worksheet from the active area down and eliminates the problem.

As an alternative, I tried selecting control shift end and then pressing delete but this does not deactivate the lower half of the sheet. Only the Delete entire row"" described above does the job.

I hope this helps to relieve you of your problem.

Please let us know if it helps or not.

All the best,

Cearbhall

NVDA is not reading out buttons in Chrome browser 21 messages,"Hi
All,

 

I
am using NVDA on a Windows10 machine. I have observed the issue below.

 

NVDA
is not reading out Bookmarks, show side panel, Refresh, Forward and back
buttons in Google Chrome browser, when we mouse hover on them or even with
tab buttons.

Although
its reading out all options in Microsoft Edge browser correctly.

 

Environment:

Windows Version : Windows 10 21H2
(OS Build 19044.1706)

NVDA Version : NVDA 2022.1

Chrome Browser Version:  102.0.5005.115
(Official Build) (32-bit)

Microsoft Edge version: 102.0.1245.44 (Official build) (64-bit)

 

Steps to reproduce:

1.    
Open
chrome browser

2.    
 Mouse hover on bookmarks option, show side
panel button, Refresh button. and verify if NVDA reads out loud all these
options

3.    
Open
Microsoft edge browser and hover on the Favourites, bookmarks button. NVDA reads
out all options as we hover over each one of them.

 

Key Points:

·       
Behaviour is same with NVDA and Narrator. Both the screen readers are
not reading out chrome browser buttons.


Thanks

Nayana
LakhwaniThe first thing I'd try is uninstalling Chrome 32-bit and installing Chrome 64-bit.   All of my machines that have 64-bit hardware have 64-bit Chrome (and all Chromium-based browsers) on them.  I didn't even have to specify when I ran the Chrome installer online, it detected 64-bit hardware and installed the 64-bit version.

        ~ Dorothy NevillThe issue of downloading Chrome just arose in one of the JAWS groups.

The online installer is always at https://www.google.com/chrome 
and the offline installer for the current 64-bit version can be obtained from: https://dl.google.com/tag/s/appguid%3D%7B8A69D345-D564-463C-AFF1-A69D9E530F96%7D%26iid%3D%7B7963AE5A-0471-BF21-99EE-0ABC200D2042%7D%26lang%3Den%26browser%3D3%26usagestats%3D0%26appname%3DGoogle%2520Chrome%26needsadmin%3Dprefers%26ap%3Dx64-stable-statsdef_1%26installdataindex%3Dempty/chrome/install/ChromeStandaloneSetup64.exe

        ~ Dorothy NevillI believe the 64 bit version can also be found on chocolety as that’s how I update, every few weeks. Much easier for those who love package managers as I do.You don't need to update in that way.  Chrome-based browsers are
    supposed to automatically update.  But instead of installing the
    program to update it, if it isn't automatically updating, use the
    about dialog.  That dialog tells you if an update is available and
    there is an update button.  Once you open the about dialog, it may
    be in slightly different places depending on the Chrome-based
    browser you are using, have browse mode on.  If you can't move
    through the interface with the arrow keys, manually turn on Browse
    mode and it will be accessible and similar to a web page.  There is
    information at or near the top of the page about updating and
    whether you are up to date.

    

    In Chrome, about is in the help submenu.

    

    GeneHi Brian,
I have tried with 64 bit version of Chrome as well, behaviour is same on that also

True.

Just to be clear, though, the OP reported a 32-bit version in use.  Even with the subsequent report regarding the same behavior on 64-bit, it still makes sense to use the 64-bit version on 64-bit hardware when that's what has been installing by default for some time now.  It's a mystery to me how 32-bit Chrome landed on a 64-bit box.

I haven't manually updated any browser in ages now, unless you count my relaunching the browser when it tells me I need to relaunch to have the update apply.  They all are good about their own care and feeding.

        ~ Dorothy NevillI was responding to Sarah's comment about how she updates Chrome. 
    she gave a link from which she evidently manually installs Chrome
    over itself perhaps every  few weeks.

    

    GeneI’d rather update through chocolety, as it  updates in the background, and I have about 30 other windows apps I update in this way, all at once. I don’t trust the about dialogue, ever, not in chrome anyway.  Give me a package manager any day, or give me the installer so I can just update by hand and keep the follinstaller around in case I have to reinstall from scratch.not every few weeks. , I just run the process  and if there is an update it will update else skip the program to be updated.You may do things in ways that computer users generally don't do
    things.  That doesn't mean that the general user should do things in
    a different way.  Chrome-based browsers update in the background. 
    and on what do you base your distrust of about dialogs?  I haven't
    seen one computer advisor nor anyone else say they are unreliable.

    

    I have no objection to you doing things as you wish but you are
    making statements and implications that updating Chrome-based
    browsers as most computer users do is unreliable or in some way a
    disadvantage to what you do, with which I most emphatically
    disagree.

As, I believe I can say with assurance, would virtually any professional computer tech out there.  I haven't seen a web browser that's unreliable about self-updating in a very long time and, much like Windows, if you recognize that it's not updating that indicates that something is wrong.

I have no issue with anyone choosing whatever methods they see fit to maintain their machines.  But I agree that casting doubt upon what are generally recognized as rock solid self-updating functions is counterproductive and innacurate.

That being said, we need to redirect this conversation to an ""as it relates to NVDA and Chrome interacting"" topic.  I can't help because the issue the OP has reported is, as far as my experience goes, singular.

        ~ Dorothy NevillActually with chrome, edge, etc you just go to help about and it
      should update itself then restart or launch.
    Just remember to do 1 at a time because it will choak if 2 run.I’ve had that update fail. I know it updates by itself , or should, but the normal user is not going to go to chrome://about to find out they are out of date.  Only the advanced user will think of doing this. The last time chrome updated to 100x it took about 2 or so week before I got the update for what ever reason and I use chrome daily as my default. I checked with chocolety and chrome 100x  was there, and updated without needing to launch chrome.I never said you shouldn't check off and on to see if you are
    up-to-date and this is very easy to do in the about dialog.  When
    you open the about dialog, the program automatically checks to see
    if it is up to date and if you look through the dialog, you will see
    that information.  I can't comment on one instance you had.  I can
    say that it is reliable.  Indeed, it was just this way of checking
    that told me that one Chrome-based browser wasn't updating because
    of a router problem I solved by powering down and restarting the
    router.  The Brave about dialog would say checking for updates and
    never go further.  

    

    I agree that you should check the about dialog about once a month to
    be sure the program is current.  But I disagree that the about
    dialog doesn't do what it should reliably in Chrome browsers, that
    is, check for updates when you open the dialog and present accurate
    information.

    

    You took one instance where the dialog may not have worked properly
    and turned it into a generalization.  One instance is not a [proper
    basis from which to generalize.  

    

    GeneIt is also inaccurate, completely inaccurate, to say that one must go to the About page to get Chromium-based browsers to update.  I virtually never do that, and Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, and Chrome all download and apply updates then show an indicator on the main menu that the update will complete when you choose to relaunch the browser.

This has been the case for, literally, years now.  Firefox does this, too, though it's not a Chromium-based browser.

        ~ Dorothy NevillSome browsers need to be watched as occasionally, they regress at least from our point of view Waterfox did this and I held off updating for some months till the crashing with nvda randomly was resolved.
I sometimes feel that software writers are too fast at pumping out their updates before exhaustively testing them, particularly with access software.
On the 32 bit thing. I agree, never use the 32 bit ones. Firefox went through a period where the 32 bit at that time was inaccessible, some years back now but it can occur.

NVDA issue with visual studio 2022 parameter help 7 messages,"First, good news is that unlike prior versions of visual studio, NVDA now works properly when navigating suggestion lists in the code editor. Previously it would read the entire line of code every time you move from one selection to the next, but now it only reads the selected item.

There is another issue, however. I will be typing a line of code and eventually NVDA will start saying “parameter help, parameter help, parameter help” over and over every time I move the cursor left or right or type a key. The only way to get it to stop doing this is to press escape  and then arrow away from that line of code and back again. This is a problem because ironically, NVDA repeating “parameter help” is making it so I can’t hear the actual parameter help. Lol. 

Before I place a bug ticket I just thought I’d see if there’s some setting I can adjust to perhaps mitigate this issue. Let me know if my explanation didn’t make sense and I can add clarifying details. All the usual stuff… Latest versions of windows, NVDA, visual studio blah blah blah. Thank youHey Luke,

NVDA may Crash with inactivity on older Windows 10 computer 10 messages,"Hi Group,

Has anyone seen something like the following.  I use an older Windows 10 computer for storage and back up. After not touching it for several hours, NVDA does not work. That is to say, there is no sound output. I know the main sound card through which NVDA voices is working because other sounds I can play with hotkeys do indeed work.  I can't really say if it crashes, but if I press the hotkey used to launch it, it seems to reload as if it had crashed and needed to be restarted.

What could cause this and is there a remedy?

For a nation to claim it has always been great, needs no improvement  and to cling to its past achievements is no virtue!Hi Ron,

I'm not sure what yu mean by  ""older"".
I am using an hp desktop with a core i5 sixth gen processor with nvda.
I bought this pc used about 3 years ago.
So it could have been  first used in 2015-16.
On a daily basis, I leave  it running with nvda set to  speechoff;  in the morning I press insert plus s to turn the speech back on.
Never had this problem.
Yes, I have had problems trying to switch from nvda to narrator  or a jaws demo,  but not nvda.I have no such problem and I'm using an old computer.  

    

    You can find out if NVDA is still running or mostly running buy
    running another screen-reader while not issuing the run command for
    NVDA.  Then, when another screen-reader is running, issue the
    command to open the NVDA menu.  If the menu opens then something has
    crashed in NVDA but the program overall is still running.  

    

    Whatever the case, since issuing the run command either runs NVDA or
    closes it and runs it again, it is an interesting question what is
    occurring, but a very minor problem with a very easy work around.

    

    GeneHi, I too seen this with an older windows ten computer.  My windows ten computer is 3 years old and I’ve seen this crash with Jaws.  Not NVDA. I issued the hot key for NVDA to see if it ran. It did.   Sent from Mail for WindowsRon Canazzi wrote:

I use an older Windows 10 computer for storage and back up.What's older?  What does winver say when you run it?

What kind of sound device?
What version of NVDA?
What add-ons are you running?

After not touching it for several hours, NVDA does not work.Does the same happen with Narrator, if you leave that running for several hours instead?

I know the main sound card through which NVDA voices is working because other sounds I can play with hotkeys do indeed work.Can you give an example of that?

if I press the hotkey used to launch it, it seems to reload as if it had crashed and needed to be restarted.Please explain that.
NVDA will always restart when you press its shortcut key, regardless of whether it had been running, crashed, or stopped before.
What, in the way it acts when you press the shortcut key, makes you think it is recovering from a crash? How is it different than pressing the shortcut key while NVDA is working normally?

LukeI don't consider 2015 old myself, as they seem to work very well even if its still got windows 7 on it as well. I'm at a loss, unless you have something else running like a malware spotter  or something. It cannot even be the sound card driver tendency to go to sleep if you get other sounds without a pregnant pause. What do the individual audio controls show. You might need sighted help for that while its in the sulk mode. Could it have somehow rebooted and decided there was no sound device? A look at the previous log after a reboot might show something up.

OK, I should have mentioned this in my original post. The computer is an 8 year old AMD clone with 16 GB RAM and a 6 core processor. ""-- 
Signature:

I wonder if it would benefit from a completely clean install of windows and your other applications?
That, and replacing the spinning drive with a solid state one if it still has a conventional hard drive might get a couple more years out of it.I see no meaningful benefit to doing any of that.  If the computer
    still works well as it is, you might get more life from it by
    replacing the hard drive but then again, the hard drive might last
    for years longer.

NVDA on Patreon? 24 messages,"Hello, Has the NVDA team ever considered opening an account on Patrion? This might make it easier for people to donate to NVDA. I’d like to start donating monthly and, not being from Australia, would find this easier than using PayPal. Just a thought, JanetI didn’t know one had to be from Australia to use PayPal… Usually, Patrion is a two-way street. NVAccess would be expected by most people to offer lots of exclusive content only to Patrion supporters, if they were to open an account there. It’s usually a platform for supporting artists.Patrion is international. As far as I know there isn’t a specific requirement for members to upload extra content.Patrion is international. As far as I know there isn’t a specific requirement for members to upload extra content.I’m in Canada and I didn’t have trouble donating to NVAccess. As for Patrion, yes, there is no requirement. I’m just saying that’s how many people use it.I’m seeing a bank transfer option on their donations page as well. Perhaps you could set that up monthly with your bank?For what it's worth, donating through PayPal isn't that hard if
      you have it linked to a bank account.  I'm in Canada and have been
      donating monthly for several years that way.  PayPal just does the
      conversions and pulls the money out automatically, then sends a
      receipt.  I never have to touch anything unless I want to change
      my amount or cancel my recurring payment.
    SteveAnd, though this may not help in your case, you can donate with a
    credit card using the donate form.

That's because you don't (although I feel fairly certain you knew that and this was rhetorical).

PayPal is international and handles currency conversions automatically just like any large international payment system does.  I discussed this literally a week ago when someone was asking whether they could use the PayPal app, as opposed to the donation page, to donate to NVAccess (you can - see message  #97607 in the archive, or the whole topic).

Even so, getting NVDA on Patrion might provide an additional donation stream.I've retitled this topic to accurately reflect the spelling for the Patreon payment service.  This isn't an attempt at snark, but at making it easier for the curious to find it (the direct link should help, too).

         ~ Vance PackardPaypal on patreon is quite easy and so is doing it with your debit or credit card. Where I have the problem on there is navigating the site a little. I follow some people on there for fanfiction and it is hard getting to there works. There is not like a click here for my works or something like that.  Sent from Mail for WindowsThanks Brian.  I just went with what spellcheck said.Hi everyone,
Of course we are happy to consider all suggestions - although as others noted, I am concerned about the reasoning for this one - if people prefer going through Patreon that is one thing, although I don't think there are too many ways of paying for Patreon which aren't available using PayPal (as noted, you can link a bank account or credit card to PayPal, or if you prefer not to have a PayPal account, you can still pay with a credit card).
Actually looks like there are one or two other ways with Patreon - Credit card, PayPal, Sofort (in a handful of European countries) or Apple Pay. ""--

Twitter: @NVAccess""Quentin, all, I have backed an artist on patreon. The problem is one of providing exclusive content to backers. You launch campaigns, promote them and get people to back them. However, we can perhaps have a broader conversation to determine if it is worth nvaccess using a crowd funding platform. Remember, the platform takes a cut, so does the payment system therefore the lesser the players in the funding chain, the better it is.   We do have an example in the adaptive technology space of one person asking for donations to his work on Linux accessibility. He is not doing significant promotions therefore I cannot tell what he is earning.Linux Accessibility is creating Accessibility Support for Free Software | PatreonPranavI donate monthly on the NVDA web site via paypal, with no issues whatsoever and I'm in the UK, it even tells me the equivalent mount in Gbp, or at least it did when I set it up. More recently I used a similar portal from one of the world blind organisations to donate to the needs of blind people in Ukraine with no issues there either.
I think their home currency was Canadian Dollars, but I could have used Euros, its all about exchange rates and the costs of conversion around the world.

While ""pay for content"" is how they started, and how they still work for the most part, they do have options for non-profits.

That being said, I am another who thinks that PayPal, Credit Card direct, and bank transfer options are way more than enough payment options.  It would be nice if PayPal were not ""a necessary middleman"" but given its dominance of the online payment space it's the one I'd least likely do without.  But every step between the money source and you gets a cut, so the fewer the better.  And the fewer methods you have to deal with and still not compromise broad ability to donate the better as well.

That really would be better phrased as ""pay to support content creation.""  Even the name, Patreon, was a spin-off of the word ""patron.""   I suspect that 'e' was meant to evoke 'electronic' but can't prove that.

It was aimed for ""artistic types"" to seek support.

    That makes sense since if it announced space when it saw spaces in a

    during ordinary reading between every word.

    

    GeneAlso, if I move by character with the left and right arrows and
    there are spaces on a line, I hear space as I move and if there are
    words and spaces, I hear the words spelled as I move and space
    spoken between words.  When I up and down arrow among lines with
    spaces and nothing else, I hear blank.  All this makes sense.  You
    don't want to hear space spoken when you are reading lines.  You do
    want to hear space spoken when you are moving by character through a
    line.

    

    GeneIt could also be argued that sighted users don't see anything for whitespace (either spaces, tabs, newlines, etc) (ok Word with non-printable characters displayed is an exception).
To the OP, In any case, if you can think of a good workaround and use case, then feel free to create an issue.  As Gene noted, you don't generally want spaces between words read out when just reading regular text, and depending on how you navigate, they ARE reported now.  Whether that fits what you need, will depend on.... what you need, and what you are doing.

    I have experienced the following issue with Blank lines and symbols.

    'Audible an Amazon company. Then I press the down arrow key 5 times

    Sometimes, I am editing a file which
      was given by a sighted person, and I see that there are lines of
      spaces but it says blank, so at the first glance, I am confused.
      But I totally agree that it is like sighted people do not see
      spaces, so line with only spaces can be regarded as blank.

    clearly.  When do you hear space blank?  What, exactly, are you
    doing when you hear it?  You write as though you hear both space and
    blank spoken when you take the same action.  For example, when you
    move by character, you hear space blank spoken when you move.  I'm
    not saying that is what happens, but I don't know what you are
    describing.  Is that what you are saying and if so, what is the
    action that causes the behavior? 

    

    GeneSorry, I found out the reason.
Because I have set nvda to report indentation, so my nvda will report space blank if the line is containing one space.

    it is outside of my knowledge.

    

    geneGene,
    Sorry, locale is irrelevant to this issue, I have used different
      configuration profile after switching the nvda locale, so at first
      I wonder the problem is related to the locale.
    Sorry for causing confusion.

    GeneHi all,

      Sorry I thought my mind was stuck yesterday. Please ignore all the
      conversations yesterday.

      Let me restate my concern.

      -----

      First of all, lets type a few lines into something like notepad

      '''

      Hello, this is the new worl.

      Hi, this is the second line.

           

      '''

      While I am typing those lines, I mistakenly typed some spaces into
      the third line, which nvda says blank.

      Now, I move my edit cursor up two line to do proof reading by
      pressing up arrows.

      Oh I found that the word 'worl' is missing a 'd' so I move the
      cursor to the end, before the dot, add a 'd.'

      Then I keep proof reading and find that the second line is
      perfect.

      Then I press down arrow to move to the third line.

      As nvda default to not reading indentations, I assume that the
      line is a blank line, because I heard nvda says blank.

      Then I keep typing the third line.

      '''

      Hello, this is the new world.

      Hi, this is the second line.

           Oh this is the third line.

      '''

      So the problem comes, I have typed those words after those
      mistakenly typed spaces.

      I know that for blind people who use braille display will
      immediately pick up those spaces because they are not relying
      mainly on speech of nvda. Even though nvda says the line is blank,
      they can still determine that the line is a line containing spaces
      by touching braille display.

      But for people like me, who do not use braille display, I am
      mainly relying on the audio information provided by nvda. So if I
      hear blank, I assumed that it is really blank and has nothing, not
      even spaces.

      But refer to the above situation, I assumed that it is a blank
      line without anything, and start typing on the third line.

      But in fact, it is not really a blank line, so what I have typed
      is after those spaces.

      

      

      This is the problem that I have came across.

      

      Thanks,

      William

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

      

    
    Gene 於 27/5/2022 19:53 寫道:Unless NVDA has an add-on for the problem, I don't know of any way
    to hear that information.  JAWS has something you can turn on, I
    think its called the text analyzer, that will say something like two
    spaces or run on of spaces, but unless there is an add-on I don't
    know about, NVDA can't be made to do that.  We'll see if anyone
    knows of an add-on.

    

    Perhaps NVDA should have some function to do that.

    

    GeneHi, I would prefer NVDA or any screen reader say something like “Three Spaces” if they are present on a line. All the best SteveHi, You could try increasing your punctuation level. All the best
SteveYes that works, but it shouldn’t say blank at the end. All the best
SteveJAWS has a feature called Text Analyzer which reports things it
    thinks may be errors.  I don't know how many spaces it reports
    beyond one space between words but it does report spaces that it
    thinks are likely to be too many.

"NVDA shows ""right to left"" on Braille 3 messages","Hi,
 
I’ve updated to 2022.3 beta 1.
For unknown reason, NVDA showing on my Braille display: right to left.

 
Its Braille extender related? 
 
Thanks much,Hi Afik

Is it a regression, i.e. a problem appeared with NVDA 2022.3beta1 which did not occur with NVDA 2022.2?
You may want to restart with disabled add-ons to test if the issue is due to Braille Extender (or any other add-on).

Cheers,

CyrilleAre you sure there isn't any Hebrew characters on the screen?
      Even if they aren't on the line you're reading they may be having
      an effect on everything. If I'm writing in a google or Youtube
      search looking for music or something and I've got Arabic or
      Hebrew in the box with English, the cursor seems to make
      everything in there read right to left. I've never used Braille in
      that case, so don't know how it would behave.

It doesn't prevent me from installing a new version via manual update, but I was surprised because I had it set to provide the notifications.

I have both ""Automatically check for updates"" and ""Notify for pending updates"" checked in the General panel of the settings dialog.  I believe they are the defaults, and they worked before.

NVDA windows 7 17 messages,"HiWhat NVDA latest version can a person use on win 7And question 2 In outlook if I type a new meassage why is not showing the concates.ThanksTimothyThe newest version can be used with Windows 7.  It will be announced
    on the list when Windows 7 support will be dropped.

    

    As far as not seeing contacts, you appear to be referring to
    autocomplete.  You don't say what e-mail program you are using and
    that is essential information.  when asking about any problem, it is
    important to include the program you are using and the Windows
    version.

    

    GeneWell at home here I always use Windows 7, but I do not have the latest Outlook so I cannot help with that. Certainly, I had no issue updating nvda to the current version and other office stuff works, though  dropbox context menu is still broken, but then it is on a windows laptop running 10 as well.
Neither use Outlook so I'd suspect that might point you to where to be looking.

Please address personal E-mail to:-
briang1@..., putting 'Brian Gaff'
in the display name field.That’s a very old version at this point. Windows 7 came out in 2009. You’re probably experiencing some other difficulties including potential security holes and compatibility issues. I’m just wondering if you’ve ever considered upgrading to windows 10 or 11?Since I have only seen you complain about the Dropbox context menu
    and no one else on the list or on any list I follow has, I conclude
    that the problem is not a general one and that there appears to be a
    problem with your systems that causes it.  Perhaps an add-on
    somewhere or a program or utility is causing the problem.  

    

    GeneHiSorryOutlook 2010ThanksTimothyAre you saying that when you begin to type an address, autocomplete
    suggestions aren't seen?  I don't use Outlook and I don't know how
    you look at what is available in autocomplete information stored by
    Outlook.  Others may know.

    

    GeneI am requesting that we take specific discussion of Outlook 2010 (in fact, anything earlier than 2016 at this juncture), to the Chat Subgroup.  Office 2010 has been out of support for some time, and there have been enough changes both to Office and to screen readers since it was actively supported that ""certain issues"" could be creeping in.

I'm waiting with baited breath for NVAccess to finally drop NVDA support for Windows 7, as so long as it exists I have to allow at least limited discussion of Windows 7 in relation to NVDA here.

        ~ Dorothy NevillHiYes you got it rightThanksTimothyThe dropbox context menu is now gone. I use it on mac and windows. I can though easily get to it by clicking the system tray icon and tabbing to the system settings button, then clicking that button. The contact menu we now know, and love is buried there.  I am btw using the latest version of dropbox and have for a few weeks. I’m used to it.The actual Context menu is gone but Brian has discussed this in the
    past and he can't open the interface that is now available instead
    of the context menu.  I didn't think about that when I replied but
    that is what he is saying.

    GeneNo sorry I'm not indeed I just had an update, the anti virus still updates and a third party anti virus  has found no issues. I am not starting a war over this, but there are very specific reasons for not going to windows 10 or 11, to do with software that actually works against new versions of software that have been screwed up for accessibility. As these are niche, I shall say no more. I do have a machine running 10, but as I say, its not for the  tasks I  mainly need. I have never ever had issues with xp either on security, tests show that the machines were always clean, and always ran without  problems since most of the problems I get here, particularly 1with 10 are when windows updates things and breaks something else.
I am after all not a corporate user I am a small charity with back ups everywhere.

in the display name field.What on three different machines? 2 running 7one running 10? No its still the same with add ons disabled. Its to be Dropbox. After all none of the enabled notifications from dropbox are detected by windows to make that ting noise whereas others from other software are. I can live with both controlling a lot of the things from a mobile app , but not the notifications, which would work up until recently. Since I use Dropbox a lot, I'm not going to muck about with it.

No its one of life's great mysteries. Probably some odd drivers combination on the machines who knows the mysteries of Windows.

I'm only guessing here, but all three machines use classic shell or open shell to make navigation much easier, but that has always been the case so should not affect anything else.

Please address personal E-mail to:-
briang1@..., putting 'Brian Gaff'
in the display name field.In the past, you complained about two things, not getting
    notification announcements and the interface not coming up that is
    opened from the system tray.  

    

    Regarding the interface, I haven't seen this complaint from anyone
    else and I'm on three blind technology user lists and the chat list
    associated with this list.  If the problem were at all widespread, I
    should have seen something.

    

    Notifications don't make a sound but they do come up in Windows 10
    and I believe they are announced.  I very seldom get notifications
    but my recollection is that they are announced.  They aren't
    presented in a way that generates the notification tone in Windows
    and that should be changed.  They aren't announced in Windows 7. 
    Wile it would be nice if they were, that isn't an accessibility
    issue in terms of whether a program is defined as accessible because
    the version of Windows is no longer supported.  I'm not saying
    anything about whether notifications still should be announced, I'm
    talking about the definition of accessible used to determine what
    meets accessibility requirements.

    

    GeneAnd now, we may have the answer.  You are using a third ;party
    utility that may be the cause of the problem and you are using it on
    all three machines.  You are saying it should not affect anything
    else.  How do you know?  You are making an unsupported assumption. 
    The interface has changed and it may have changed, not just in how
    it is organized, but in how it works technically in Windows.  

    

    I am not assuming the utility is causing the problem but I have said
    that you are evidently running something that is since I haven't
    seen one other complaint about not seeing the material in the
    interface.  I don't know if you are running anything else that might
    cause the problem but this meets certain requirements.  You are
    running it on all three machines and you have the same problem on
    all three machines.

    

    I see no advantage in using utilities that change the Windows start
    menu.  You can easily move to that part of the start menu that shows
    apps or you can use the shell:apps.folder function to get a list of
    all apps.  

    

    There have been changes in the start menu over time but the Windows
    10 start menu is similar to the Windows 7 start menu and the XP 
    start menu isn't that different in terms of working with the list of
    apps.  

    

    Whenever people use these kinds of third party interfaces, my first
    question is, what are you losing access to.  Given the technical
    changes in Dropbox, that may be something you lose access to when
    using some of these utilities.  It may be the only thing now, but as
    applications change technically over time, you may lose access to
    one or more others that display information in the system tray.

NVDA with Android emulators. 15 messages,"Hi Experts!Greetings!How accessible are the Android emulators with NVDA?If I install BlueStacks in my windows 10 PC, will NVDA support accessing it easily as usual like the other programs?And is there anything to setup or consider before starting?Any Add-on available for this? Appreciate your ideas please.Thank you, have a pleasant day!Ravi.  V.S.Ravindran.Excuses leads to failure!””no you can't access the android emulators with NVDa. you need to install talkback to use the ambulator. you may use nvda ocr to go through the initial screen of bluestak but to use the android os you need to use talkback which is not possible to use until you get any sighted assistance to install it. note:Hi,Thank you for this info.So, is it possible to install Talkback in the Windows PC under BlueStacks?In that case temporarily disable NVDA and use Talkback to operate the Android app?Thanks,Ravi.  V.S.Ravindran.Excuses leads to failure!””And does NVDA behaves the same in Windows 11 under same conditions in Android Emulator?Because I heard that Win 11 has some support for Android apps.

Unless something has changed, radically, since the use of an Android emulator under Windows last came up, there's no NVDA involvement at all beyond triggering the emulator under Windows.

One should think of an Android Emulator (regardless of which one) as a virtual Android machine running on a Windows box.  When you have focus in that environment, it is entirely under the control of Android itself, so you would need to have Android Accessibility Suite installed and turned on when you ""slip into the Android world"" the emulator provides.  When focus gets thrown back out of that environment and into Windows, NVDA is right there on deck.

         ~ Vance Packardhi VI Techability ,you said: ""I have seen blind people using it with talkback.""but for your general information, I should tell you my friend its not talkback its subsystem screen readerhi Brian,ok I strongly agree with you. But tell me if it's possible to make nvda work till the installation of talkback. You will say why I am saying this. But sometimes some blind people find it odd to take sited assistance that's why when they use nvda or any other assistive technology they feel independent.so sorry if someone got her. my intention is not like that.On Wed, Jul 27, 2022 at 01:44 PM, udit pandey wrote:

To my knowledge, no, and that's not limited to NVDA.  None of the Windows screen readers do this.

Once you are in the emulated OS environment you have essentially left Windows, and all running Windows programs, until you exit it again.  I had Blue Stacks installed at one point but used it so seldom I removed it.  Someone else here is going to have to discuss how to enable the Android screen reader under an emulator via the keyboard and likely without any feedback as I have no idea how that's done.

Yes, you can use all Android apps in an Android emulator.  I can't imagine any reasonably new computer having any difficulty with any Android apps running under the emulator of choice.

The above being said, discussion of how to use Android emulation itself is off-topic for the NVDA group.  If any among the membership wish to discuss this in depth, please create a topic in the Chat Subgroup.

If anyone happens to know of an existing group (whether on Groups.io or elsewhere) for Android Emulator users who are blind, please share it, as that would be the ideal and appropriate venue for pursuing these sorts of questions in depth.

I can then hit enter . You can also, if it still works, hit alt plus q and type sort and find the options there.  I say if it works as, it has been broken now for at least 2-3 weeks.Hi,Thank you so much for that help.Both methods work fine.I used to  go with alt + V and then tab to sort by earlier.

It is.  I have no idea what version of Outlook you had been using before 2019, but the Arrangement/Arrange by group of the View ribbon is what handles what is used to sort the messages in a given mailbox.  ALT + V, AB then look at the options for arrangement.

This sort of question really belongs on the Microsoft Office Accessibility Discussion Group

NVDA with Team Viewer. 8 messages,"Hi Group,The latest NVDA Version 22.1 and Team Viewer latest versions does not provide any useful accessibility.I am not too sure which has caused this problem. Because I have both latest versions running.When I open Team Viewer NVDA does not speak anything.

Anything am I missing or doing wrong?Team Viewer was fairly accessible with NVDA rather than Any-Desk. But now giving problem. Kindly advice.Thanks,Ravi.This is in my Windows 10 with H2 version.I have had exactly the same experience.   Chris Tromborg, Ph.D.Mountain Lion FoundationFeline Conservation FoundationBehavioral Enrichment for Captive Animals Animal Communication, Behavior, & CognitionFeline Conservation & Biology1-530-753-2763 Home1-530-902-2763 Cellcattromborg@...www.christromborg.comI'm  pretty certain its team viewer. I say this as I had a remote session with a sighted friend and when we started I had an older team viewer and all was sweetness and light. However he decided to do the update on my machine while he was sorting out a problem, and ever since its been the electronic equivalent of a brick.
I think the quick  connect temp version will still work, but if you want to do the driving, then they have mucked something up, and I bet its something really stupid. I have not  contacted them, as I seldom need it, but it just goes to show that companies still do not do accessibility testing before they unleash new versions.

Is there a way that we could report about this to the Team Viewer support?
Regards,
Ravi.I can reproduce this.  It is a team viewer issue. I’m lucky though my aira agent can just snap a pic of the screen and  grab the codes that way.  I hope they do fix this, although I don’t think I’ll be needing TeamViewer much longer.I have no contact with them. I would hope somebody might have though and get them to fix it. This sort of regression is all too common in software.

NVDA with WhatsApp. 29 messages,"Hello Team,
Greetings!
NVDA accessibility with the What's App desktop application is very poor as at now.
As suggested by the NVDA Team earlier, I contacted the WA Support Team and they are very positive to improve on this area.
However, they requested me to send a video demo of the way it works in the desktop.
But, my several attempts to record the issues in short videos did not work. For some reason even videos of 7 minutes or 5 minutes could not be sent from my phone.
In the initial page, NVDA just says ""Button"" without the labels.""
Also, opening any attachments, video or audio is not simple with a click.
Scrolling through the chat list is also a concern as at now.
There may be more.
Therefore, would someone here with technical expertise be able to do a video recording and send to the WA Support Team as the accessibility issues please?
     Thank you, have a pleasant day!
Ravi.The following 30 minute YouTube tutorial, How to access whatsapp in laptop or desktop using NVDA screen reader by Saagar SK, may prove helpful to you.  It dates from the end of 2021, so isn't very old.

The tutorial narration is not in English.  I am not ""good enough"" with the languages of India to say which one it actually is.  NVDA itself is announcing in English throughout.

      Tips:

      • Instead of opening the emoji panel, you can search for emojis
      directly using the colon shortcut. When

      you type the colon : followed by the emoji name, WhatsApp will
      show related emojis. All you need to do is press the Enter key to
      insert it. You can navigate

      between the emojis using the arrow keys on your keyboard. For
      instance, if you want to add the mask emoji, type :mask. The
      results will start showing when you enter two characters at least.

      • You can change the font, make your text bold or italic using the
      shortcuts.

      1. Put text in asterisks to bold it. For instance, *hello*

      2. Place underscore on both sides to italicize the text. For
      instance, _Guidingtech_

      3. Use tilde on both ends to strikethrough your message. Example:
      ~GT~

      4. To change the font, place three backticks on both sides of the
      text. Example: ```Hey```Many thanks. This will be extremely
      helpful.
    

    
    Kind regards

Will paste it later in an email as I didn’t know there were that many key strokes.I redid the document and included all tables where they should have been. Here it is reproduced.   IntroHi, if you have the Whatsapp desktop add-on installed, you will be able to use the following hotkeys and shortcuts. Some of them are already found in Whatsapp desktop itself. I hope it help. Thanks.Whatsapp Desktop with NVDA

Once the menu is opened, move with down arrows to the option select messages, which must be activate with enter.
Press Alt + right arrow to bring focus on list of messages.

Selection mode shortcuts:

 mark and unmark the message with focus SPACEBAR. Verbalize the number of selected messages S. Forward the selected messages R. Delete the selected messages Delete Highlight the selected messages D. Cannot work Exit selection mode Q.  Depending on the selected function, the corresponding window will be activated. The contact selection in the case of forwarding, the confirmation window in the case of message deletion, etc.

Tips:
 Instead of opening the emoji panel, you can search for emojis directly using the colon shortcut. When
you type the colon : followed by the emoji name, WhatsApp will show related emojis. All you need to do is press the Enter key to insert it. You can navigate
between the emojis using the arrow keys on your keyboard. For instance, if you want to add the mask emoji, type :mask. The results will start showing when you enter two characters at least.
 You can change the font, make your text bold or italic using the shortcuts.
1. Put text in asterisks to bold it. For instance, *hello*
2. Place underscore on both sides to italicize the text. For instance, _Guidingtech_
3. Use tilde on both ends to strikethrough your message. Example: ~GT~
4. To change the font, place three backticks on both sides of the text. Example: ```Hey```I redid the document and corrected some spelling mistakes.

NVDA2022.1RC2 Silent Start Button? 5 messages,"I just installed RC2 of 2022.1.
Upon focusing the Start button, NVDA says nothing and goes silent.
In addition, if I shift+Tab back to the desktop listview of icons, it says nothing, but focus indeed moves between them.
Highlighting an icon and right-clicking it for a menu still has NVDA silent.
RC1 did not do this on my HP DQ1038WM with the Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-1005G1 CPU @ 1.20GHz, 1201 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s).
Strange indeed.
But when I then focus back onto the taskbar/notification area,
NvDA starts talking again, as if nothing was wrong.Hi Jason,
Have you rebooted the PC since updating to RC2?  We often see ""odd"" quirks like this just after updating NVDA and before restarting the PC..
Kind regards

Fast fingers...
I may need to write the developer of a piece of software called Explorer Patcher just to let him know about this
(that his Windows 10 taskbar code writing causes this hiccup in NVDA).
But switching the taskbar style to Windows 11 and NVDA behaves perfect.
I've just been so used to the Windows 10 taskbar for so long that the 11 one feels funky.
(I.E., the user-promoted notification area only lets you move through its items when you use left or up arrow keys.
To see the other notification items, you're forced to right arrow
(Whereas in Windows 10 you could actually use all 4 arrow keys to move equally among the notifications..

Even tried a System restore just to be sure I reboot.

Need help with Thunderbird and Mozilla Apps Enhancements 33 messages,"Hi, I just installed Thunderbird yesterday, got the afore-mentioned addon, and had no problems moving columns opening the dialogue with NVDA+H, though I got the no column headers found error once until I made sure I was in the message list. Today a friend decided to get Thunderbird as well, just installed the addon, and gets the message column headers not found. I remoted in and tried matching some of her view menu settings to mine, but still can't get the column headers dialogue on her machine. Being in the message list or even in a specific message doesn't help. Rebooting NVDA and Thunderbird didn't help. We're both using the latest Thunderbird and NVDA with Windows 10. Any settings she needs to change to get this to work? She wants to move correspondents to the top of the list just like I did. Thanks.

Shawn KleinSince I don't know what is causing the problem, there are two things
    I will suggest, though I don't know if either will help.  I am
    confident my second suggestion will and I don't know about the
    first, but I consider the first to be an inferior choice.  You might
    consider running the portable version for the reasons I give below,
    as well.

    

    Uninstalling and reinstalling the program is one and the other is
    trying Thunderbird portable.  

    

    There are one or two minor or very minor things you can't do with
    the portable version but in general, it does everything the
    installed version does.  In addition, if the program ever becomes
    corrupted, you can have a back up copy and just delete the one you
    are using, then copy the backup to the location where you keep the
    one you use.

    

    And you can use the program from an external drive or copy it to any
    computer you wish and use it.

    

    Here is a link to download an old version of the program with the
    add-on already installed and the from line already displaying at the
    top.  The program will automatically update after it has been placed
    on the machine but even if the add-on doesn't work, the program may
    need nothing changed.  I expect the add-on to work, however, since
    it did in this copy on my machine.

    Its a portable program so unzip the files wherever you want and,
    when in the folder, type t to get to Thunderbird.exe.  Press enter
    to run the program.  You can also send a shortcut to Thunderbird.exe
    to the desktop and create a short cut command to run it that way if
    you wish.

    GeneI don't know if the following will be of any help, but since it's in my stash of tutorials, it can't hurt:


 
Rearranging the Column Order in Thunderbird Using the NVDA Mozilla Apps Enhancement Add-On
The following presumes you have already installed the previously noted Mozilla Apps Enhancements add on, have restarted NVDA, and have Thunderbird up and running with focus on the Thunderbird window.

1. Hit NVDA+H.  A dialog entitled, Manage columns, appears.  That dialog is composed of a list of the columns in the order they are currently being displayed from left to right, with the leftmost column at the top of the list.

2.  The next thing I suggest you do, but this step is optional, is to hit ALT+O, which will cause the list of Thunderbird columns, in Thunderbird itself, to be displayed with a checkbox in front of those columns you wish to have displayed, and nothing (unchecked) for those you want to hide.  It's worth down arrowing through that column list and deciding if there are any currently checked (displayed) columns you'd like to hide, and uncheck those, and vice versa.  Hitting ESC closes the Thunderbird column selection process and throws you back to the Mozilla Apps Enhancements dialog.

3.  Back in the dialog column list, gain focus on the column that you would like to move.  If you want it to be to the left of where it is (and that means it would be announced first), then hit ALT+U to move it up by one position.  Repeat the ALT+U as many times as necessary to get it where you want it.  If you want this column to be announced later than it currently is (moving it to the right/down the list), hit ALT+D as many times as necessary to get it where you want it relative to other columns.

4.  Review your column order by going to the top of the list and down arrowing through it so you know what the ""First announced to last announced"" order is.  If you find a mistake, then repeat step 3, moving the column or columns to where you want them.

5. Navigate to the Close button for the dialog and activate it.  You're done.

    GeneThanks Gene. You mention an addon that's included with the
      portable Thunderbird, which app is that? Mozilla Apps enhancements
      is an NVDA addon, not a Thunderbird addon, so not sure if that's
      the one you're talking about. My friend is on the list and
      watching this thread, so we'll see if she has any luck with it.
    Shawn KleinThanks Brian. The problem is, despite being in the Thunderbird
      window with the keyboard cursor on the message list, the dialogue
      would not open, instead saying no columns available. One thing I
      forgot to do is make double sure she had the right version of
      Thunderbird and didn't accidentally get an old one. I have 91.10.0
      and the columns dialogue works fine for me on my system with
      NVDA+H.
    Shawn KleinThat's right.  I was thinking about the other add-on, which is a
    Mozilla add-on.  It allows first letter navigation in the folders
    tree view and it is included in the copy of the program I sent.

    

    You could try uninstalling and installing Thunderbird again and the
    NVDA add-on, but just using the portable version would, I think, be
    a better solution.

    

    GeneIt doesn't matter ifit is old.  The add-on works properly as far
    back as a 60.x version.

    

    GeneHello Gean and all.
    I got it fixed!
    Turns out I had the thread view unchecked.
    Now the add on can see the columns.Perhaps it is checked by default.  I never had to change the
    setting.

    

    GeneAh interesting.Is there a way to not make it say the email address when I sent out a test message to myself?Does it say both your name and e-mail address?  What about when you
    get mail from others?

    

    Gene

    GeneIt only said my email address, not my name.Since others see your name, whatever the cause, you don't need to
    worry.  I see this:

    Keao Wright nvda@nvda.groups.ioLets see, at the time when I replied back I was using outlook.
    Do you use reply to all when you send a message back to the list?No, just reply.  That is determined by how the list is set up.  Most
    lists don't require using reply to all.

    

    Geneah ok, thanks Gene!

    
    Does nvda work with HTML emails ok?Yes.  

    

    GeneOk, sounds good!

New NVDA Add-on: Speech Logger,"Good morning

Announcing a new(ish) add-on, which I don't believe has been announced here before.

Speech Logger. An NVDA add-on to log speech to a file or files. It can log speech generated on the local machine into a text file. It can also log speech from a remote machine received through the NVDA Remote add-on, either to the same or a different file.

This is probably an add-on that most people will never need, but for those who do need to work with what has been spoken, I don't believe anything has existed to do this before now.
The user who originally asked for this, was especially interested in being able to get a log of what was spoken on a remote machine via the NVDA remote add-on, which does not report its speech via the NVDA Speech Viewer.

More info and download: https://addons.nvda-project.org/./addons/speechLogger.en.html

This was originally released around May 5th, but I didn't mention it here because it wasn't available on the community add-ons site until more recently.

Enjoy!

New Thunderbird Version 102.0 Issues 23 messages,"Hi Group,

The new Thunderbird version 102.0 has some issues. the address book is configured and different. It is similar to but not exactly like a web page. for best results in navigating it, turn off virtual cursor and then use tab key to get to the list of your addresses.  first letter navigation does not work as it did in the past in the address book, so you will have to use the search field which now appears in the tab order of the items in the address book. Type the first few letters of an address you want to highlight and then tab to the list and you will land on or near the proper address. Use up and down arrow keys if you don't land exactly on the desired address. This isn't to dissimilar to the way preferences were changed to be more like a web page a few years ago in Thunderbird. it takes some getting used to but is quite usable once you understand what is happening.

In addition, the Mozilla apps enhancement feature for Thunderbird is broken.  I hope the developers will be able to fix this add-on so it works as it did in the previous versions.  We should all send them e-mails to make them aware of the issues and desirability for a fix.

For a nation to admit it has done grievous wrongs and will strive to correct them for the betterment of all is no vice;
For a nation to claim it has always been great, needs no improvement  and to cling to its past achievements is no virtue!Good reasons not to update.  I really don't see the need to keep the
    program current if you are just using e-mail and don't care about
    possible new features.

    

    I'll be curious to see the new setup.  I have a copy of Thunderbird
    Portable I keep current to keep up with any problems or changes I
    find in the program but for general use, I don't use the current
    version.

    

    I keep one copy current out of curiosity and so I might be of help
    if people ask about problems.

    

    GeneHere, below my signature, is the page that comes up in Thunderbird the first time it runs after the update.  As you will see, the header layout has been changed, which assumedly, accounts for the NVDA Mozilla enhancements no longer working.

If people aren't aware of this, you can set Thunderbird not to update automatically and to inform you when updates are available.

New in Thunderbird 102
This article describes some of the major changes visible to users in Thunderbird version 102. Full details of all the changes can be found in the Thunderbird release notes from 102.0 and up.
Thunderbird is both free and freedom respecting, but we’re also completely funded by donations! Help us sustain the project and continue to improve.
Screenshot of Thunderbird's new system dark mode.
Screenshot of Thunderbird's new message header.
MESSAGE HEADER REDESIGN
Thunderbird 102 helps you be more productive with less effort. When reading your email, the redesigned message header allows you to focus on what matters as it highlights important information. It’s also more responsive and easier to navigate. Plus, you can star important messages from the message header itself, and easily convert them into a calendar event or a task.
NEW ADDRESS BOOK
Thunderbird 102 gives your contacts a serious upgrade! The refreshed design makes it easier to navigate and interact with your contacts, and helps you better understand who you’re communicating with. The new Address Book has compatibility with vCard specs, meaning if your app can export your existing contacts into vCard format, Thunderbird can import them. Each contact card also acts as a launchpad for messaging, email, and event creation.
Screenshot of Thunderbird's new addressbook.
Screenshot of the new import and export wizards in Thunderbird.
NEW IMPORT/EXPORT WIZARD
Thunderbird 102 makes it quick and simple to move your accounts and data around. The new step-by-step wizard provides a guided experience for importing all that data that’s important to you. We’ve also taken extra precautions to ensure that no data is accidentally duplicated in your profile after an import. Moving from Outlook, SeaMonkey, or another Thunderbird installation is easier than ever. No add-ons required!
NEW SPACES TOOLBAR
Thunderbird 102 makes navigating the application more intuitive thanks to the the new Spaces Toolbar. Move between all of your activities with ease, whether it’s managing email, working with contacts through the awesome new address book, using the calendar and tasks functionality, chat, and even add-ons! If you want to save screen real estate, the Spaces Toolbar can be dismissed, and you can instead navigate the different activities Thunderbird offers with the new Pinned Spaces tab.

NEW MATRIX CHAT SUPPORT
Thunderbird 102 offers a new way to chat privately and securely with your colleagues, friends, and family. We’ve added support for the open-source, decentralized chat protocol Matrix, and it’s usable right out of the box! (As always, we welcome your feedback since it’s an evolving service.)

Contribute to this siteIf you want to look down the list of addresses, if you turn browse mode off in the address book and tab to the list, you can up and down arrow in it and it will appear as a standard list.  There is no first letter navigation.

Autocomplete works as before in e-mail messages.  I haven't played with the search address book feature to any extent and I'm not sure I understand it yet.

GeneHere is an odd thing.  The NVDA Mozilla apps enhancements didn't work when I first tried it in the new version.  I tried it again a little later and now it does.  I was playing with the address book search, and I have no idea if that changed anything regarding the layout but it works for now, at least for now, I don't know if it will continue to work.

GeneHi Gene,

I still can't get it to work. I even restarted the system and still no go.

What did you change in the settings in address book or program that seemed to get it to work? ""-- 
Signature:
For a nation to admit it has done grievous wrongs and will strive to correct them for the betterment of all is no vice;
For a nation to claim it has always been great, needs no improvement  and to cling to its past achievements is no virtue!""I just wrote different things in the search dialog, tabbed to the
    list, and down arrowed through the results.  I don't see why playing
    with the address book would cause any change and I don't know if it
    did.

    

    You could try maximizing the window or normalizing it, whatever is
    the opposite of what it is now, but I didn't do that.

    

    GeneHere is more information:
It appears what I did working with the address book had no bearing on the add-on working.

I'm running Thunderbird Portable so I updated an old version and tried working with the add-on in the newly updated version.  The add-on worked, even though I hadn't done what I did in the address book in the version I updated earlier.

I hope others discuss whether the add-on works if they update.  I don't know if the add-on generally works or not and if people are going to ask that it be modified to work with the new version, we need to know if the modification is necessary.

GeneGene  and all,

I am using nvda 2022.1, thunderbird 102, Mozilla Apps Enhancements 1.16


If I open the addressbook, say pressing ctrl shift b,

nvda immediately focus onto the search field.

If I type something like nvda, then I press two taps I can browse all the match search results by moving up or down arrow.

If there is a link to an old copy of the known to work portable version it needs to be on a web site somewhere. I will have to abandon OE soon, but Outlook does not do Newsgroups, but Tbird still does.

Please address personal E-mail to:-
briang1@..., putting 'Brian Gaff'
in the display name field.I don't have NVDA set to automatically go into focus mode but if you
    do, from what you say, it automatically does when you open the
    address book and are on the search all address book field.  Your
    description is correct if you have NVDA set to work that way.  

    

    If you tab around, you will find a search button and pressing it
    evidently only searches one address book.  I was originally playing
    with that option but the search you are discussing is faster to use.

    

    If someone wants to move through the actual list of addresses,
    however, you may have to go into focus mode because NVDA may go into
    browse mode when you tab out of the search field you are
    discussing.  

    

    I think it is faster and easier to use autocomplete and not take
    time to go into the address book at all and to move from a search
    field to a list of results.  

    

    GeneOn considering this further, from what you say, NVDA doesn't go into
    browse mode automatically when you tab away from the search field. 
    But if anyone is either on the main list or in a list of search
    results and you can't move properly through the list, turn off
    browse mode and you will be able to do so.

    

    GeneI temporarily restored NVDA to use factory defaults.  I didn't think
    about that until now.  I found that NVDA does automatically leave
    forms mode when you tab out of the search field, but it goes back
    into forms mode automatically when you tab to the list.  Whether you
    have done a search and you are in the list of results, or you just
    tab to the list without doing a search, in which case you see all
    entries in the address book, you automatically go into forms mode in
    the list so you need do nothing.

    

    In the old days, you could just use first letter navigation in the
    list so this is a little less convenient but its only a minor
    drawback.  Even before the change, I used autocomplete because it
    was faster and easier.  

    

    Genehi gene.
what is the best and most accessible version of thunderbird with nvda?
also, how about new versions of firefox with nvda? ""-- 
By God,
were I given all the seven heavens
with all they contain
in order that
I may disobey God
by depriving an ant
from the husk of a grain of barley,
I would not do it.
imam ali""It isn't a question of accessibility.  You should use the current
    version of Firefox for security reasons.  It is as accessible as
    previous versions.

    

    In Thunderbird, my experience is that on slower machines, version
    68x is faster at opening messages than later versions.  I don't know
    how fast your machine is but a number of people have said, when I
    raised the question on a list that messages open quickly in the
    later version they are using.  If you are dissatisfied with the
    speed messages open, you may want to try 68.x.  I'd have to upload a
    version of 68X to a file sharing site if you want to try it.  I made
    minor modifications to the program such as including the Mozilla
    add-on that allows for first letter navigation in the folders' list.

    

    GeneI  should have said that I would upload a version of  68.x Portable,
    on which I made minor modifications.The current maintainer of the Mozilla Apps Enhancements is aware of the issue(s) that have arisen with the 102.0 release of Thunderbird and is working on on a fix.

See this topic in the NVDA Add-Ons Developers group:  
Mozilla Apps Enhancements Urgent and Interim Update for Thunderbird 102.0 Users

There still remain issues as the interim update did not fix everything, and the developer knows that, too.

        ~ Dorothy NevillI've just updated to Thunderbird 102.0.  It's working just fine here.  Only issue I have here is that progress bar showing download status is no longer read.  Hope this will be fixed in the next version of NVDA.

RogerAAh yeah same here.

Its the only thing thats not showing up.

Its fine for sending progress but not download.Hi Brian,

    

    Great news!  i had sent the developers a private e-mail based on the
    info in the help/about add-on.  It's nice to know that they are that
    diligent.  Thunderbird is mostly accessible as is now--except for
    the add-on.  As mentioned in my previous post, the address book
    functions a bit differently and this tool bar business is a bit
    different, but once you get used to it, if they can fix the add-on,
    it will be fully accessible again.

New version of Dictionaries add-on 3 messages,"Hello friends!


It is now available the version 22.06 of this add-on!


Here is the readme:


## Introduction
This add-on provides a quick way to access, so far, 68 dictionaries.
In order not to overload the add-on , only the dictionaries for Portuguese, English and between these two languages are provided.
The remaining can be downloaded through the add-on itself, using the new interface for managing dictionaries.
We are available to add other dictionaries. So if you want to add a dictionary, please contact one of the authors.


## Usage

To start using this add-on , press Control+Shift+F6.
A window will open where we find a list of the dictionaries present on our computer, from which we can choose the one we want to use, and open it with Enter.
We also have a button to access the window where we can manage dictionaries, a button to set the default dictionary, and finally a button to close the add-on , which is also achieved with Escape.

In the Manage Dictionaries window, we have two tabs: Manage and Download.
On the first tab, we can set the order in which the dictionaries appear in the list or delete the selected dictionary.
On the Download tab we can choose the dictionaries we want to download to use.


## Commands
The command to invoke the extra is Control+Shift+F6.
You can also use the command Control+Windows+F6 to access the default dictionary search directly.
Note: If you do not define a default dictionary, the first dictionary in the list will be used.

You can change these commands in the Input gestures  dialog, in the Dictionaries section.


## Auto update

This add-on includes an auto update feature.

Checking for a new version will be performed each time NVDA is loaded.

If you want this to happen, go to the NVDA menu, Preferences, Settings and in the category of the extra check the checkbox.


Direct download:
https://github.com/ruifontes/Dictionaries/releases/download/22.06/dictionaries-22.06.nvda-addonSorry but I think I'm missing something here:

When you speak of dictionaries, do you mean something like word replacement dictionaries for your screen reader or synthesizer or a real dictionary where you can look up spellings and meanings?  The lookup type of dictionary would be a very handy tool.

By Sean Budd


NV Access is pleased to announce that version 2022.1 of NVDA, the free screen reader for Microsoft Windows, is now available for download.
We encourage all users to upgrade to this version.
Highlights
This release includes major improvements to UIA support with MS Office.
For Microsoft Office 16.0.15000 and higher on Windows 11, NVDA will use UI Automation to access Microsoft Word documents by default.
This provides a significant performance improvement over the old Object model access.
There are improvements to braille display drivers including Seika Notetaker, Papenmeier and HID Braille.
There are also various Windows 11 bug fixes, for apps such as Calculator, Console, Terminal, Mail and Emoji Panel.
eSpeak-NG and LibLouis have been updated, adding new Japanese, German and Catalan tables.
Important Note:

This release breaks compatibility with add-ons made for NVDA 2021.3.5 and earlier.

Please note, after updating any software, it is a good idea to restart the computer.
Restart by going to the Shutdown dialog, selecting “restart” and pressing ENTER.
Updating software can change files which are in use.
This can lead to instability and strange behaviour which is resolved by rebooting.
This is the first thing to try if you do notice anything odd after updating.

    in File Explorer.  I don't know why.  Perhaps there is a setting
    about showing the progress bar or where it is shown.

    

    GeneActually one other thought occurs to me - when you say ""a lot of small files"", do you mean one at a time?  If they finish copying within say a second, Windows won't display a progress bar and NVDA won't beep, it's just done. ""--

Twitter: @NVAccess""Hi,

See if ""more details"" is checked when looking at copy dialog.

Cheers,

JosephJoseph,

No, More Details was definitely not checked. Also, the folder in question contained over ten thousand files and was about two gigs in size. I should have gotten something. Seems to work fine everywhere else but File Explorer. I'll try it with More Details checked and report.Since it's already been reported that this issue with File Explorer and NVDA is not global, that directly points to an issue specific to a given machine.

The first thing, always, is The Most Basic Troubleshooting Steps for Suspected NVDA Issues.
That helps eliminate ""the simple things"" that could be at play with NVDA.  In this case, I'm really not suspecting NVDA, but they still need to have been done.

Since this is more likely to be something Windows related than NVDA related, I'd try Windows-focused repairs first.  Whenever any inexplicable issue presents itself in Windows “out of the blue” and with seemingly no reason, these are the two things I try first, in order:
1. Using DISM (Deployment Imaging Servicing and Management) and SFC (System File Checker) to Repair Windows 8.1, 10 & 11
2. Performing a Windows 10 or 11 Repair Install or Feature Update Using the Windows ISO file
If #1 fixes the issue, #2 is unnecessary.

         ~ Vance PackardBeeps returned when I changed Explorer to More Details.I also don’t get a progress bar sound in file explorer, I thought that was normal actually. Come  to think of it, I  have never gotten a progress sound in explorer even with progress beeps on.I have my view set to details, is that the same thing? Just curious here.  TY.I wonder at times why people are so concerned to hear progress
    announcements or beeps.  In general, I want things to be done in the
    background, not announcing things that distract me or that tell me
    information I'm not interested in.  

    

    If I'm copying something that takes awhile, if I read the title bar,
    I get a percent that has been copied if I am in the window.  I don't
    hear all sorts of progress reports I don't want to hear.  

    

    Its not that I never use progress announcements.  Occasionally, I
    use a program where progress announcements aren't conveniently
    available in a way such as reading the title bar.  But I wonder if a
    lot of the interest in progress announcements is because people
    don't realize how easy information is to get in some or many cases.

    

    A lot can be learned by trying things.  I learned about the title
    bar progress method by just seeing what happened if I read the title
    bar while copying files.

    

    GeneThere is no connection.  Details shows more about files shown in the
    list but it has nothing to do with this.  I haven't looked at this
    setting much but my understanding of it is that it is a check box
    that is available when you are copying something and you can see it
    when you tab around.  It provides more information about the copy
    process.

And I wonder at times why you wonder at times about the why's and wherefores of how others work. Are you one of these minimalist blind people that pride themselves on getting by with the least amount of information so they can look like they're so efficient and productive alongside their non-blind counterparts? LOL! I didn't think so. So give it a rest and listen to what other users are saying--that they had the same problem I did but thought it was normal, and they're glad someone asked about it and got a solution that helps their productivity.


And please don't respond to this message. I'm not into flame wars. I'm just trying to point out that if a tool or feature exists, no one should feel they should avoid using it because someone thinks that person's way is inferior or inefficient. The way you work is best for you; the way I work is best for me. The two ways are different. And that should be where this thread ends.On Thu, Aug 4, 2022 at 12:33 PM, Steve Matzura wrote:

-
Take your own advice.  All of us have the right to wonder about how other people handle things, and to express our opinions about same.  It's no skin off your nose.

In addition, and this is not a case like this, very often ""how someone works"" reveals an ignorance about other options.  I can't count the number of times someone's said that they do something one way, which is without question a more difficult way, and were advised by others that a number of other options exist.

I have tired of people who seem to thing that being challenged or questioned on a group like this one is inappropriate.  It isn't.  You, and anyone else, is free to take or reject any advice offered.

         ~ Vance PackardPlease stop looking for bad motives.  It should be obvious if you
    aren't looking to be insulted, that if I were as you describe, that
    I wouldn't help or be able to help people as I do because I wouldn't
    know as much as I do and I wouldn't bother to explain it.

    

    I'm simply asking if this is an example of blind people not being as
    aware of different ways of doing things in Windows because they
    don't look around.  You can learn a lot by being curious and looking
    around.  For example, by looking around just because you are
    curious, you will see lots of information in the footers of list
    mail such as how to change your delivery status, unsubscribe etc. 
    By looking at web pages just because you are curious, you may find
    things that help you work with web pages in general or that one in
    particular.  For example, by looking around, I found certain
    patterns, such as that web pages that expect people to contact the
    company or whatever has put up the page, you will find a pattern. 
    Most such pages use the phrase contact us or use the word contact in
    the contact link regardless of whatever words they may use.  I can
    go to an unfamiliar page and find that link if that is what I'm
    looking for far faster than if I hadn't looked around and seen that
    pattern.

    

    Get the chip off of your shoulder.  

    

    GeneI should add that I might not have raised the question but I thought
    the message was on the chat list.  Nonetheless, the discussion may
    encourage people to look around and try things just because they are
    curious.

    

    Sighted people are aware of all sorts of things related to using
    programs or other computer-related things just because they see
    them.  Not looking around needlessly limits your knowledge and
    information.

    

    GeneI’m very aware of the title bar,; sometimes however I get a ghost progress while copying, I.E, it says 100 percent and it appears to be done, the dialogue does not go away.  This has been an issue off and on since Iv’e been using windows 10, for the past 5 or so years now, hence I want that extra sound, plus I think in 3d space, so having that sound helps me picture where in 3d space the progress bar is.Right, I should have realized this. I have that box checked; no beeps as well. I can live with that, just curious as to why they are not happening.I believe it is because in more details view the progress bar is replaced with a graph that is filled along the horizontal axis to indicate copy progress, and along the vertical axis to indicate transfer rate over time.You missed my point, which was to say that it's not our business
      to openly wonder why people do the things they do the way they do
      them. In my opinion, that's just unnecessary and, quite frankly,
      harsh criticism folks don't need. Ask all you like about why
      others do things differently than you do; using phrases like ""I
      wonder why"" can be easily misinterpreted to mean ""How silly you
      are to do things that way, when my way is so superior--I don't
      need all that other nonsense."" Suggesting better methods is always
      good; putting someone down for failing to acknowledge the
      superiority of your methods or for using others that you yourself
      might not like or use, that's not cool.",1753,15,0.00855676,0.00855676,1,1791,28.33,11,80.39,26.04,21.07,19.77,88.22,68.23,55.39,14.96,7.71,4.24,0.28,1.9,0.11,1.12,7.26,13.4,5.3,3.29,11.73,9.77,6.25,7.43,2.74,18.26,4.91,4.19,4.47,0.73,3.07,0.67,19.6,1.23,18.37,5.19,2.96,1.79,4.63,0.39,6.03,0.06,2.57,1.45,1.01,0.95,0.22,0.61,0,0.06,0,0,7.93,3.52,0.78,0.28,0.17,0.06,2.07,4.36,0.06,0,0,0.22,1.06,0,0,1.06,3.85,0.06,0.78,2.68,0.28,0.11,0.5,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0.17,0.17,0.89,0,0.11,0.06,0,0.06,1.84,4.86,9.44,1.23,1.12,4.52,1.84,1.12,0.11,3.63,3.35,5.92,0.61,0.56,0.56,0,0,0,19.71,6.37,4.36,0.28,0.06,2.62,6.03

OBS Or Alternative Software? 4 messages,"Hello everyone,

I am playing around with OBS Studio, and it is very confusing to me. Does anyone know how to use OBS? I am trying to connect to stream my radio station. If OBS is not the right solution, what is the right software? I am trying to stream to MixCloud. I got the 30-day free trial of MixCloud Pro.

If you have any questions, please let me know. I am using Windows 10 with NVDA.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Armando VIasYou cannot stream your radio station using obs. Look into station playlist
studio instead.  Obs is for video and audio. And I use it all the time, not
easy to use but fun.Yes Mushroom FM uses playstation radio, and most of the presenters are blind, so it must work, though I'm told that many use the shark with scripts.

Old versions of add-ons 6 messages,"All the talk about add-ons recently has prompted me to think of the

    Is anyone keeping a publicly accessible library of unsupported

    GeneTo my knowledge, the NVDA Add-Ons Directory (hosted by the Spanish-Speaking NVDA Community Association) does not remove add-ons that are no longer compatible with the latest version of NVDA.  When you search they tell you the range of NVDA releases, e.g., From NVDA 2014.1 up to 2022.1, that the add-on(s) returned are each compatible with.

there, which I used briefly several years ago.Yes one case in point is that for reasons I'll not go into here,  I like to retain Goldwave 32 bit, but all the latest add ons are for the 64 bit, so I keep an older copy and install it on an older version of nvda portable for this reason. The one add on I'd like to see made 2022.1 ready is the sound schemes/3D sound one which I find aids me in knowing a bit more about physical screen layout, but the author has either moved his address, died or is not interested.

Older videos do not load while brousing through channel in video on firefox 21 messages,"Hello everyone,
I have been having a problem for a while using NVDA on firefox. I've
asked the firefox forums because I thought it was a firefox problem,
but no help there.
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1380217#answer-1513242
Also, when I tested with JAWS and asked my mother to use without
screen reader no problem.

The problem basicly is that when I'm brousing through a channel,
videos after several months do not load. This is not the case on
chrome, using JAWS on firefox or without a screen reader, where I can
go right back to the earliest video available on that channel. But on
firefox, using NVDA the videos stop loading after a while.
Any suggestions? I'm not even precisely sure where the problem lies,
as NVDA with chrome doesn't have the same problem, and firefox with
JAWS doesn't have the same problem, but NVDA with firefox does.when you try to open the video does it throw an error or just do nothing?

Try going to the bottom of what you can see on the page, and hitting tab or something. This should cause the list to scroll a bit more. You may have to keep doing this repeatedly. Its'a  pain in the butt for sure and we can thank mobile devices, I think, for bringing about this web trend.I will say this, again:  These kinds of issues cannot be successfully discussed or solved in the abstract.

A single URL, two for good measure, of pages where this behavior exhibits itself would go a very long way in helping potential assistants to try to figure out what may be occurring.

        ~ Dorothy NevillNot sure if I just inferred this and maybe it’s not the case, but I thought they were talking about the youtube display page, either for one’s personal recommendations ora  channel one clicks on to see their uploads.I too have experienced this sort of thing (though it doesn’t matter what screen-reader or browser it is in my case), and yes, it’s usuallyb ecause the page is not scrolling as you navigate with the screen-reader. You have to actually do something actively witht eh page in order to make it scroll – such as moving the mouse pointer.On Sat, Jun 18, 2022 at 06:51 PM, JM Casey wrote:

I don't care what is being talked about.  Specific examples are NOT optional when you want others to troubleshoot.  This is not news, or rocket science.

Those doing diagnostics all need to be on in this case literally the same page.  I've seen people load mobile pages, by intent, on computers and the behavior is very different for these.  No matter what it is, a single example, and preferably several, should be provided when asking this kind of question.  That's anywhere, not just on this group.

        ~ Dorothy NevillI suspect the explanation in the below message is the answer. 
    However, on pages like this, where content is added as you scroll,
    just going to the bottom of the page doesn't necessarily cause the
    desired action to happen.  You may have to scroll to the place or to
    near the place where the additional information should appear.

    For example, on Youtube video pages, if I just move to the bottom of
    a page, that won't cause the comments to appear.  If I move down the
    page and get to the place in the page where the comments should
    appear, the page will scroll and comments will appear.  So you may
    have to move down a page, by using page down and then down arrowing
    a bit and then using page down again, etc.  If that doesn't work,
    you may have to quickly down arrow through a page until you see what
    you want.  This is inexcusably bad page design and it means that
    find won't work reliably when searching a page.  

    

    Geneon the pages I've used that scroll, I don't have to move the mouse
    pointer.  Simply moving down the page to the point where it should
    scroll will result in it scrolling.  If you move beyond that point
    such as by moving to the bottom of the page, the page won't scroll.

    

    GeneIt’s inconsistent behaviour. The script on the page has to interpret that youv’e done something “active” to make it scroll; sometimes just using browse mode/virtual buffer as you normally would does not do it. I tend to find that youtube works better with chrome than Firefox (and probably with other chromium-based browsers as well) in the sense that it’s not very responsive with firefox, so that is probablyw hy the OP thinks this problem only exists with firefox, at a guess.Specific examples, in this case, are completely useless, regardless of
weather they are mandatory or optional. The behavior is consistant
over youtube pages. I will post a couple below however.
I also wanted to send the log in debug mode, but though I looked in
temp I couldn't find it there, as I had done before. If anyone can
tellme where to find it, or if clipping pasting the log after opening
log viewer in debug mode will due, I can send that as well.

https://www.youtube.com/c/TarihObas%C4%B1/videos

https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/videosIn addition, I am using the latest updates of windows, firefox and
NVDA, though this problem has been going on for a while.Even if the behavior is the same, it is still important to furnish
    at least one link.  You talked about a page with a lot of videos
    going back for years.  People aren't going to search for channels to
    find one that meets those requirements.  At least one relevant link
    is important to give.  

    

    GeneI use this trick 
go to end of page which you found end of load video
then press NVDA+space to focus mode
and press down 
the more video will load
then press NVDA+space to browse mode normally
repeat these step  when you want load more video or playlist in Youtube on FirefoxThere is nothing wrong with how Firefox or any other browser is
    working with the page.

    To see all the uploads, do the following:

    Find the button that says uploads.  

    Turn browse mode off.

    \Tab and shift tab to be sure you are on the button.

    Press the space bar.

    Down arrow to all videos and press enter.

    

    Return to browse mode.

    Move to the bottom of the page and below the last item, there is a
    next button.  Activate it with the space bar.

    You will see more videos if there are more.  As far as I can tell,
    you will be able to see everything uploaded in that way by following
    the next button until you have moved to the earliest videos.

    

    GeneI had tried tabbing before but didn't work, the focus mode and down
arrow however, did the trick. ThanksYes if the list is really long it goes very like a search engine, and after the selected number of results, you get next, or more or some other link or button to go through the next page, often it will tell you haw many pages there are but not always.  I have also had some strange things like the mute button on the audio track mysteriously being enabled, but that is a whole other issue and may well be google trying to be helpful to screenreader users!

No, they're not.  As Gene pointed out, there are lots of ""short"" YouTube pages.  Forcing others to look around when you can (and did now) give an example or two is both rude and silly.

Also, the posting of logs is not permitted on the group.  If someone requests a log file, it should be sent privately.

The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.
        ~ Dorothy NevillThe simplest solution I've found to this problem is making sure you're in focus mode then hitting the End key.  On every YouTube video page I've tried (and those are the ones offered) each successive press of the End key causes the next ""chunk"" of videos that occur after what's currently already on display to load.  You have to be in Focus mode, as the use of End in this context is a browser keyboard command.

I constantly use both Home and End to shoot to the beginning/end (respectively) of fixed size web pages and will now probably start using End a lot more to trigger ""next batch"" loading at the current end of a page that loads contents in ""chunks.""

OneCore Voices Uninstalling themselves 11 messages,"A couple weeks ago, I installed the OneCore voices for Japanese and a few others, so I could use them in future. I had a bit of trouble getting them to stick around initially, but they seemed to cooperate, not disappearing after restarts. I just went and checked, though, and I'm back to only the voices for US English and Australian English.


Is there a way to stop Windows from removing these voices whenever I look away for too long?Just checked, and all the voices are visible within Narrator when I go to install more, but NVDA doesn't see them when I switch to 1Core voices in the Speech Settings. What's going on?Checked again, and although the voices are listed in the dropdown where you can choose which voice narrator will use, the only installed packages were English—United States and English—Australia. I reiterate, how do I stop Windows from uninstalling these packages when my back is turned?Just a thought, as obviously I do not have a need for Japanese, but could there have been a windows update which has caused them to disappear?

I do have it on a laptop, but regularly find settings have changed after an update like the views of files and folders and the security settings.

in the display name field.Did you try exiting NVDA and running it again?  I don't know if that
    would help, of course, but that is the first thing to try when odd
    problems develop regarding NVDA.

    

    The second, if that doesn't help, is to reboot.  Then, its time to
    do other things, if necessary.

    

    GeneThey have disappeared in the past.  I think there is some sort of
    minor problem on the system but I have no idea what it is.  I
    suspect they are gone but rebooting before doing other things is a
    good idea.

    

    GeneYou have a lot of unexpected minor behavior problems on your
    computers.  As I recall, you use a utility that changes the view
    used by Windows in places.  I'm not sure where.  But perhaps the
    settings changes may be caused by that utility.  Its better just to
    learn the small changes in the format, such as those in the start
    menu and use the new system as it is.  

    

    On switching from Windows 7 to Windows 10, I looked at the start
    menu, and very quickly found how to get to the list of
    applications.  If I open the start menu and tab twice, I am in the
    list.

    

    I don't like introducing utilities that change the intended display
    of items.  I don't know if or how such utilities may have unexpected
    results and the changes to the view are minor in general.

Then something is wrong on that machine.

In the early days of Windows 10, it was routine, and insanity-making, how updates, and particularly Feature Updates, would change user settings without any sort of warning, not even a message during the install process that some settings might change.  That has not been the case literally for years now.  I cannot recall the last time I've witnessed a change in user settings with a Windows 10 update.  If you're having stuff like this happen ""regularly"" then something is wrong, and it is not by any means characteristic of how Windows 10 usually works.

         ~ Vance PackardThis topic will be locked after this post.  The issue that started it, while related to synth voices, is clearly NOT an NVDA-related issue.  NVDA does not ever remove OneCore voices.  These are controlled at the level of Windows, as is the whole process of acquiring and installing them.  If in-depth discussion about this particular issue is desired, the Windows Access with Screen Readers Group is the appropriate venue:

Pauses in MS-Word 12 messages,"Dear Friends, I do not usually keep up with this list, so please forgive me if this matter has been dealt with recently. When I work with Word documents NVDA frequently pauses before reading something to me. The pause frequency and the length of the pauses increase as the documents get longer. I have had this problem for years and with different versions of Word and of NVDA. Currently I am using Microsoft 365 and my NVDA is up to date. Is there some configuration I need to change, either in Word or in NVDA? Warmly,RalphI've seen this sort of thing as well, and its nothing apparently to do with the version of word. Its as if there is a spike in resource grabbing somewhere every so often then it returns to normal again. I always put this down to something else other than nvda, as it also seems to upset the typing according to sighted people where you can go on typing then all the missing ones arrive on screen at once. Is this what the other person gets?

in the display name field.Yes, it seems to have nothing to do with NVDA. The web tells me a number of things to do that I can't understand. I'll have to get a sighted tech to help me out on this.

RalphThere used to be a problem of responsiveness in Word when using
    NVDA, by that I mean NVDA responsiveness.  I haven't seen it
    discussed for awhile and I almost never use Word, but I'd like to
    see more discussion about this by developers.  I'd also like to see
    more discussion from those who test with other screen-readers such
    as JAWS, it could be a demo or a full installation, it doesn't
    matter, or perhaps Narrator, if Narrator supports Word enough to
    test with.

    

    My recollection is that the way the problem used to be, the larger
    the document, and perhaps the farther in you are in the document,
    the slower the responsiveness is.  I'm not saying either side, that
    it is or isn't an NVDA problem, is correct, I'm saying that I don't
    think we have heard nearly enough to form any conclusion.

    

    The response of the original questioner is that he sees many
    possible solutions suggested.  I think that before significant time
    and effort is spent looking for and trying such solutions, more
    discussion is needed.

    

    And how large are the documents where such problems occur?  It may
    be that beyond a certain size, any word processor or text editor
    will slow down.  I've opened enormous documents in Notepad and had
    responsiveness problems, but that is when opening documents that are
    enormous, perha;ps the size of two or three novels or more.  I think
    we need more definition of what we are talking about, more testing
    and discussion.

    

    GeneAlso, the original message specifies very specific problems.  It
    says in part, ""... When I work with Word documents NVDA frequently
    pauses before reading something to me. The pause frequency and the
    length of the pauses increase as the documents get longer..."" 

    It isn't at all clear, at least to me, that problems others have
    discussed are the same in origin or relevant to the very specific
    ones discussed in the original message.  The original message is
    quoted at the bottom of the quoted messages in this message.  

    

    GeneWhat are those things the web is ""telling you to do""?
Perhaps we can help you do them without having to enlist a light-slave.https://expediencesoftware.com/what-is-causing-microsoft-word-to-slow-down/

RalphI don't see anything in that article that isn't accessible to us.My problem is that I am not that computer literate. I can call on a son-in-law. 

As I progressed on proofreading my 22 page file, I have come to think that there could be an NVDA problem, after all. This is because pauses became failures to read at all. There were times when it was silent for paragraph reading, word reading, sentence reading and even letter reading. I could only get it to read again by selecting words.

Ralphthe article makes suggestions but doesn't explain how to do the
    various things suggested.  This has nothing to do with accessibility
    but rather of knowledge of how to do what is suggested.  So, blind
    or sighted, these things are probably all accessible, they all sound
    accessible to me.  

    

    We'll see if people explain how to do these things but before doing
    them, and we don't know if they will help or not, try seeing if this
    is an NVDA problem.  Are you using Windows 10?  If so, it is easy to
    see how responsive Word is using Narrator.

    

    Unload NVDA. 

    Run Narrator with the command control Windows key enter.  That is,
    hold both control and the Windows key and Press enter.

    When you want to unload Narrator, use the same command.

    Narrator uses the same read to end commands as NVDA, at least in the
    desktop keyboard settings, which are those it uses by default.  I
    don't know what commands it uses in the laptop keyboard settings. 
    It also uses caps lock as a Narrator key, or insert, probably either
    insert.

    If you are using NVDA key down arrow for read to end, try the same
    in Narrator.

    Movement commands should be the same, such as read by paragraph,
    down and up arrow to move by line, etc.  

    The read current line command is NVDA key numpad 8, that is, hold
    the NVDA key and press NVD 8 while doing so.  

    If you get sluggishness moving through documents with Narrator, then
    the problem is either not an NVDA problem or it is not all an NVDA
    problem.  Before doing various tasks such As are discussed in the
    article, it should be determined if this is an NVDA problem or not
    to the extent testing can determine that.

    

    Also, what do you use Word to do?  Another way around the problem,
    which hasn't been discussed at all, is to use another program to
    work with the documents you are working with.  But we need to know
    what you do with the documents.  Are you using Word features where
    you need word or are you just going through documents and manually
    changing or revising the document?

    

    GeneDear Gene,  I tried using Narrator and there were no pauses. Then I tried NVDA again and there were also no more significant pauses—only a bit when I selected many of the document formatting options. I tried over some time to reproduce the delays I had struggled with before, but without success. Is it possible that Narrator reset something in the Word document or in Windows 10?Warmly,Ralph .No, but perhaps this is an instance of a problem being solved by
    closing and opening the screen-reader again or by rebooting.  Was
    that the first time you closed and ran the screen-reader since the
    problem began?  

    

    At times, shutting down and running a screen-reader solves problems
    and sometimes problems that you wouldn't expect to have anything to
    do with the screen-reader.  At times, if I can't copy or paste,
    closing and running the screen-reader solves the problem.  Then
    there is rebooting, which also solves many odd [problems.

It's tested to work with NVDA 2022 regardless of the dot release.  That's pretty much been the pattern in general, if something's compatible with a dot one major release it does not revert to incompatible with dot two and higher.  Now, when the next major NVDA release comes out (2023, which is a while away yet) some things will likely become incompatible until the necessary tweaks are made.  With any luck, more of that will be happening during the early betas.

This is one of the problems that can't be solved as far as add-ons go, at least not entirely.  Those who create them are sometimes going to walk away from them, and if they aren't picked up by another developer, well, . . .

    and, in a case like this, continue to use the add-on without
    disruption.

    

    GeneHi,

All I can say at this time is that this game changing feature will be part of a future NVDA stable version (some of you should know what I'm talking about; spoiler alert: take a look at recent alpha changelog).

        ~ Dorothy NevillPerhaps the update function should present a screen explaining why
    this is important to do and giving users the opportunity to answer
    yes or no to having it done.  I don't think most users would think
    about this themselves.  My objection to updates of this kind is that
    they remove the previous version.  That is why, if I used JAWS to
    any extent, I'd probably install a completely new version and not
    use the update function, thus leaving the old version on the machine
    in case I want to use it.

    

    GeneHi,

This is quite an interesting suggestion, but I doubt it can be implemented quite easily. This is more so now as tools exist to update NVDA without relying on its own update mechanism - some people are using a tool called Winget (Windows Package Manager) to update NVDA, in which case you won't be prompted to save current version as a portable copy somewhere. Same goes with the Windows Store version of NVDA where Microsoft Store takes care of updates.

As for the game changer I'm talking about, well, looks like the cat is out of the bag, so:

Later this year NVDA will include its own delayed character description functionality provided that this feature (introduced to a recent alpha build) stays in NVDA 2022.3. This continues the recent trend of add-on ideas or features becoming part of NVDA screen reader.

Cheers,

Joseph, I have the highest respect for you because of your knowledge, your willingness to share it in abundance as well as for your many contributions to the community. I am grateful for all of these things. However, I don’t find this particular
 message helpful. Since the alpha builds and their changelogs are available publicly it’s frankly silly to say, “I know something big but I can’t talk about it but check the alpha builds.” This is not elementary school and we’re all adults. Please either say
 nothing or just state what it is that you’re talking about. There’s nothing wrong with stating that you can’t comment on it beyond what’s in the alpha builds.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgHi,

The criticism and rebuke are warranted - I apologize for making things messier, especially to Janet for not showing professionalism in my answer earlier.

While the add-on was updated on Spanish community add-ons catalog (sometimes called nvda-addons.org), a few weeks ago I did ask community add-ons people to review the latest version of Enhanced Phonetic Reading compatible with NVDA 2022.1. I did update this request, noting that this feature is now part of NVDA, but the add-on author reminded me that there are internal differences between how the add-on does things and the method employed in NVDA. Whereas the add-on uses a timer to measure how long it should delay before announcing character descriptions, NVDA uses a synthesizer command to achieve this. The biggest concern from the add-on author (not me) is speech synthesizer add-on differences - not all speech synthesizers are compatible with recent NVDA releases, or if they are compatible, they do not implement a key piece that NVDA wants to use. As part of delayed character description work, SAPI4 synthesizer code was edited to support the key piece needed to support delayed character descriptions. As NVDA uses synthesizer (more towards speech) commands, one thing you will notice is that some speech synthesizers (notably Microsoft SAPI5) will have a slightly more delay when reading characters phonetically than other speech synthesizers (tested with eSpeak NG, SAPI5, Windows OneCore, Nuance Vocalizer, all of them supporting this feature).

If things went as planned, Enhanced Phonetic Reading compatible with NVDA 2022.1 would have been in your hands by now, but the request I posted about it are awaiting review and approval from community add-ons folks at the moment. The add-on author (again not I) and NVDA folks had a lengthy debate about implementation issues surrounding this feature. I concur with the add-on author on the point about speech synthesizer add-on updates and maintenance, and these add-ons are more sensitive to compatibility breaking changes as some deal with speech internals.

Again my apologies for making things difficult.

Cheers,

JosephThere is though in the latest alpha an incompatibility with the dev version of sound schemes. The problem for me is that all the current alphas exhibit the issue and the ones that worked have dropped off' the bottom of the list. I rather took my eye off the alphas recently due to personal commitments.

Portable copy 20 messages,"Is it possible to run a portable copy of NVDA from a folder on a hard drive?  When it wants to update, will it update the portable copy; wherever it might be located?  Thanks

<HT>You can run a copy of NVDA portable from anything, a removable
    external drive, a thumb drive, on your internal hard drive, anywhere
    from which your computer can see and run the program.  Of course,
    you shouldn't run it from a cdrom because you wouldn't be able to
    update it, but I suppose it could even run from one, if you never
    make any changes, which would all be immediately lost when the
    program closed.

    

    the program will update just as it does wherever it is located.

    

    GeneIt's possible to make and run a portable copy of NVDA (or any other program that has a portable variant) from any media of your choosing.

Although portable variants are intended to be, well, portable the two things that determine that they truly are:
1. They're placed on media that can be carried with you, e.g., a thumb drive, SD card, external HDD.
2. They do not install, and by that I mean in the literal sense.  Installed programs make entries in the Windows Registry and also often either add libraries of their own into the existing collection or rely on libraries from it.  Portable variants do neither of those things and everything they need is self-contained in the folder structure created.

The NVDA installer (whether a fresh one downloaded from NVAccess, or the built-in auto update function) does not update portable copies.  If you want updated portable copies you need to have NVDA make new ones for you.

So, yes, you can create a folder such as C:\Portable_Programs\NVDA and create a portable copy of NVDA there, and it will remain there, and can be run from there, and it will never be updated unless you update it.  You can also, at the same time, have an active installed version of NVDA on the same machine.  Some people create portable copies of whatever version of NVDA it is that they currently have running, and do so in a dedicated folder on their hard drives, immediately prior to updating to a new version as an ""insurance policy"" against possible issues.

By the way, once you have a portable copy on anything, the root folder can be copied over to as many other places as you might wish, and you have additional portable copies since all pieces needed to run a portable copy are contained in the folder structure.

You need to explain yourself further on this one.

When I (and most computer people) use the term update it refers to the program itself, not user settings that may be associated with it, whether it's a portable copy or installed.

Portable copies do not update.  Fresh copies are created.  You can ask NVDA to create a new portable copy of another version in the same place, but you have to ask it to do that, whether through the NVDA installer or from the Create Portable Copy function in NVDA Tools.  This is in contrast to how the installed copy will auto-update where all you do is confirm that this is what you want to allow.

The above is not hair splitting, it's a fundamental difference.

         ~ Vance PackardPortable programs can and generally do update just as nonportable
    programs do.

    

    If a portable version of NVDA updates, it follows the same procedure
    as the installed version except that you will be told that a
    portable version is being created and it will be installed where the
    old portable version is.

    

    GeneI should add that I'm not sure what you are saying about the
    portable version and updates.  You can set it not to look for
    updates, just as you can the installed version.  Whether it updates
    is determined by you, just the same as you determine whether an
    installed version updates.  

    

    As I said, I'm not sure what you are saying.  I'm saying that the
    update procedure is the same.

         ~ Vance PackardI'm saying that from the user's point of view, updating is the
    same.  I haven't seen anything about what you are saying, if I
    understand it correctly.  You appear to be saying that when you
    update a portable version of a program, an entirely new version of
    the program is placed on the machine and when you update an
    installed version, new files are added so technically, the procedure
    is the same.  But from the standpoint of the user, you follow the
    same procedure to update.

    

    GeneI had thought the procedure is the same but I haven't carefully
    compared.  I tend not to update portable versions, though I have.  I
    keep an installed version current so I can test problems users
    discuss and I may want to play with a new feature.  But I generally
    leave portable versions as they are.  They do what I want so I leave
    them alone.

    

    GeneHi all,

To clarify a few points:


The nature of portable copy of NVDA: it is identical in shape and form to the installed copy of NVDA except for two things: it does not have special privileges (no audio ducking, for instance), and user configuration folder is stored in the same location as the portable copy directory. As installed and portable copies are identical, portable copies DO support updating to a newer version of themselves.
Creating versus updating portable copies: you can create a portable copy of NVDA in three ways: when launching NVDA installer, NVDA menu/Tools/Create portable copy option from installed NVDA, or via command-line. These options do provide an option to start the just-created portable NVDA after creating it. This is the method Brian is talking about, whereas Gene and I are talking about updating portable NVDA once created.
Answering Howard: yes, you can create a portable NVDA anywhere (removable media and internal storage included) except locations where you must be granted admin privileges and on optical media.


While I have an alpha build of NVDA installed on my computer (for development and testing reasons), I have portable versions of beta and stable builds, as well as an alpha build containing add-ons registered on community add-ons website to test add-on compatibility. I do run and update portable copies from time to time, more so for beta builds whenever new betas or release candidates are released. I keep a stable version handy to replicate stable version experiences and to test various add-ons.

Cheers,

This being the case, is there a way to create a .bat file with a command line invocation of NVDA that would tell it not to check for updates.  I haven't needed to create archival portables for some time, but when I do I don't even want them to ask me about updating them.  The main reason, besides needing NVDA briefly on a machine where I choose not to install it, that I create portable copies is to ""freeze that version in time.""

         ~ Vance PackardHi Group,

    

    Well since I am receiving conflicting information (from other lists)
    concerning Thunderbird accessibility, I installed a portable version
    of 102.1.1 and told it to check for updates.  When the updates are
    downloaded and installed, I can see what if any accessibility issues
    remain or have been addressed.  When I am sure that they all if they
    ever are, then I will install the permanent version to my system.

    As of now 102.1.1 still has issues with the status bar. We shall
    see.

    GeneYes I do this all the time in fact.  Yes it does run from CD but is s l o w and you cannot change anything of course.

If however you manually download a new version you have to tell it where you actually want it.

I've seen no change to this at all. Both copies attempt to overwrite everything that has been altered, but leave other stuff untouched, including in the portable version all the add ons and settings.
The only differences in working are as stated that it  can only do stuff the user its installed for is allowed to do, since its not usually the admin and has security protocols to uphold given as Brian says, it can be copied off to anywhere.

This is why it can even run on a CD as you just move the whole folder to the writing area for the cd, but it is  very slow, I know I tried it!


I guess the next question will be if we can run it on a remote drive over the web. I'll pass on that one.

in the display name field.OK and this is my last word. MOST portable programs do, but I have not managed to get Libra Office to do it, and just recently, Ccleaner keeps pushing installed copies to me even though I'm running it in a folder as a portable.
I had to take the machine back to stop this as it decided to obliterate my list of things to look at on registry cleaning and in the end I downloaded a new portable copy and had to manually make the changes to the settings to stop it clobbering the default browser, and email client.
Be careful.

"Preview announcement: what's coming in Add-on Updater 22.06 and Windows App Essentials 22.06, short-term add-on release plan","Hello all,Although I’ll provide details soon, I figured it would be best to provide a sneak peak at what’s coming in Add-on Updater 22.06 and Windows App Essentials 22.06 (scheduled for next week at the earliest):Add-on Updater 22.06: no change in functionality between current (22.03.1) version and 22.06 apart from an internal change to a routine used when checking for updates.Windows App Essentials 22.06: this release packs a lot of goodies, including initial support for upcoming Windows 11 features and bug fixes.IMPORTANT: Add-on Updater 22.06 may turn out to be the last version compatible with NVDA 2021.3.x. This add-on usually requires latest stable version of NVDA, but about once a year, I extend support for old stable release for a little longer so you can install add-ons compatible with future NVDA releases. I expect to release a version of Add-on Updater requiring upcoming NVDA 2022.1 in a couple of months from now. Of course I will provide a notice about this once that happens.Also, it might be possible that Windows App Essentials itself will skip NVDA 2022.1 altogether (called “version jump”). Recent NVDA alpha builds (which may become 2022.2 at some point in the future) includes major features from this add-on, the most notable being letting NVDA announce Windows 11 Notepad status bar content. Typically I provide support for current and immediate past stable NVDA releases, but if NVDA 2022.2 turns out to be a feature-packed release, then I’ll go ahead and ask you to upgrade to 2022.2 when it is released in the future (to reduce maintenance burden for the add-on). I’ll provide more details soon (perhaps shortly after NVDA 2022.2 beta 1 is released).Lastly, I hereby announce that there will be no add-on releases (stable and development builds) in June 2022. As I hinted before, I need a break from everything NVDA, and June is the perfect opportunity to do so. Therefore, version 22.06 releases of my add-ons will be the final task before going on vacation. This necessarily means I won’t be able to respond to latest happenings with NVDA and Windows in a timely manner, but rest is what I need more than another countless nights spent on communicating back and forth with Microsoft engineers. I hope to be able to recover most of my energy from the past so I can at least keep add-ons going (I have ended contributing code to NVDA screen reader directly).Thanks for all your support, and I look forward to presenting version 22.06 of my add-ons soon.Cheers,Joseph",417,14,0.033573142,0.033573142,1,429,73.21,7.93,93.2,67.94,39,24.01,80.89,60.61,46.39,9.32,5.36,4.66,0,0.7,0,0,3.96,10.96,4.9,5.36,15.15,6.99,5.13,6.29,0.7,13.99,6.29,5.13,0.93,0,0.93,0,11.66,1.17,10.26,0.93,0.93,1.4,2.1,0.93,3.73,0,3.96,3.5,0.47,0.7,0.47,0.23,0,0,0.23,0,4.43,3.73,1.4,0.47,0,0,1.17,0.7,0,0,0,0,0.93,0,0,0.93,2.8,0.23,1.4,0.93,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.63,0.23,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,4.2,6.29,0.47,1.63,4.43,0.47,0,0,12.35,1.63,4.43,5.59,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,20.51,7.93,3.73,0,0,1.17,7.69
Problem of NVDA while working with python language 8 messages,"Hello all,For many days, I have been learning python and working on some python projects.

Best,Krit Kediadiving into the world of technology!You may get more traction on a question like this on a programming-focused group.  Not that the question is inappropriate here, but this group is focused on end users and NVDA and very few of them have direct programming experience, regardless of the language involved

Problems with Thunderbird using NVDA 33 messages,"Setting up my win11 machine using current NVDA and thunderbird portable.  When I move from thunderbird to another program window (alt plus tab) and then come back to thunderbird (alt plus tab), the list of messages is ""not available"".  Only after I tab and shift tab does it become available.  I am new to this thunderbird portable; so I'm wondering if it's just a thing with the portable version and maybe should I go back to an installed version which I've used for years with only a different set of problems.


Thank you.

HowardI don't use Windows 11  but I have never had this problem with the
    portable version and I haven't seen anyone else complain of such a
    problem.  

    

    Windows 11 is technically similar to Windows 10 and using that
    version of Windows shouldn't cause the problem.  I use it on Windows
    10 without the problem.  

    

    You may try the installed version of Thunderbird if you like.  I
    suspect there is some sort of minor problem with your installation
    of Windows 11 that is causing this behavior.  The problem is a minor
    one and drastic action such as placing a new copy of Windows 11 on
    the computer and reinstalling everything to see if that solves the
    problem is, in my opinion, an enormous amount of work that I don't
    think is justified to solve such a small problem.  I would simply
    work around it by closing the program and running it when you want
    to use it again.

    

    If you want to try to eliminate the problem, I have no objection to
    trying an installed copy of Thunderbird.  

    

    GeneAlso, I see that you said that if you tab and shift tab, the message
    list becomes available again.  That is such a small thing to do that
    it is by far the fastest and easiest way to deal with the problem. 
    it is faster and easier than closing and opening the program again. 
    There are some very small problems that aren't worth worrying
    about.  Not every problem has to be solved.  

    

    I don't know what problems you have with the installed version but
    of all the problems you might have, I can't think of any problem
    that is more minor and that requires so little to work around than
    the problem you are discussing.

    

    GeneThank you Gene, it's certainly a problem I can live with.  Just
      thought someone else might have experienced the same.
    

    
    HowardWe'll see.  I don't know how many people on the list are using
    Windows 11 and Thunderbird but I doubt this is a general problem.  

    

    GeneHi Howard,

I have never seen this issue with the installed version.  Maybe try it again on Windows 11.  I think NVDA performs much better with Thunderbird than does JAWS. ""--

    I am using Windows 11 with Thunderbird. I do see a minor focus issue
    with Thunderbird.  In particular, when I first launch Thunderbird,
    sometimes, if you wish to use the numpad keys to read the
    name/subject of an unopened message, NVDA says 'blank.'  At times
    just after launch, the status line does not read with the insert +
    end keystroke.  A simple F6 key press and then tab key press
    restores functionality.

For a nation to claim it has always been great, needs no improvement  and to cling to its past achievements is no virtue!I'm not sure what you are describing.  Thunderbird doesn't open in
    the message list.  After I open Thunderbird, I use f6 twice, to move
    to the message list.  You may be doing the same thing in a slightly
    different way.  Pressing f6 once moves you to the folders tree
    view.  Tabbing once moves you from there to the message list.  I use
    f6 twice because it is the same key pressed twice consecutively and
    that is more convenient than using two different keys where one key
    used twice will do the same thing.

    

    This has nothing to do with the version of Windows being used and I
    am very doubtful that it matters if you use the portable or
    installed version of Thunderbird.  it is just how the program opens.

    

    GeneThanks Ron,


Speaking of thunderbird and jaws, I have an interesting situation.


With NVDA and into reading a message, press delete and it goes to the next message; but then interrupts it to tell me about moving the old one to trash.  It also interrupts to tell me it's downloading and how many.  Quite a nuiscence.  The interruption problem does not occur when using jaws.  There must be a setting that I can make in NVDA.


HowardI just closed TB 4 times, and found it opens where ever you left
      off. 

    
    So if you close in the list you will be there when you open it.
    Now the thing here is focus, because NVDA has nothing in focus
      until you tab. Then you get focus.
    Want to try? Just close it in the list and reopen.
    Then do a shift + tab and you will find yourself in the folder.I don't know how you stop those announcements in JAWS.  If you
    aren't doing this, close the message you are reading with escape,
    then delete the message you have read, and you will automatically be
    on the next message.  Press enter to open it and you may hear none
    of those announcements.  If you want to leave the message you are in
    opened and move to the next message, if you use NVDA, you can stop
    hearing the information you are describing by turning off report
    dynamic content changes.  The command is NVDA key f5.  Its a
    toggle.  You can leave it off or turn it on again after you finish
    using Thunderbird if you wish.  

    

    If what I wrote wasn't clear above, what I mean is that if you want
    to leave the message you are reading opened and press delete while
    it is o;pened, you will move to the next message and it will be
    opened.  If you close the message and press delete, you will move to
    the next message in the message list and press enter to open it.

    

    GeneHi Howard!

Are you sure you are using the last portable version of Thunderbird?

That behaviour was found on old versions and it is already corrected lots of versions prior to the most updated version...

Às 14:49 de 02/08/2022, Howard Traxler escreveu:that may be but I don't know if that is true unless you tell NVDA
    not to display certain things in settings.  The reason I discussed
    using f6 is because it always works the same way regardless of how
    many tool bars or whatever else is being displayed in different
    parts of the window.  Pressing it twice always moves you to the
    message list.

    

    GeneI don't think that problem was corrected if you do what I am
    describing, delete an opened message, then the program moves
    automatically to the next message and automatically places you in
    the opened message.  I'd have to experiment and see.

    

    GeneI just tested this using NVDA.  If I have a message opened and press
    delete, if report dynamic content changes is on, I hear
    announcements such as deleted one message, opening message.  If I
    have dynamic content changes off, I hear no such announcements
    either way.

    

    GeneThank you.  I didn't know about dynamic content changes.  I'll havve to try to find that and change it.

-
That can be found by hitting ALT + T, P [Tools Menu, preferences].  In the General Tab, which is the one that opens by default, there is a checkbox for Close message window/tab on move or delete which is unchecked by default.  So if it remains in the default state, when you delete a message you're currently reading it will be replaced by the next message in the same window.

         ~ Vance PackardI have seen it intermittently on Firefox, its as if the info about focus does not get to nvda. Is there anything that may be using too many resources on at this time. so a processors used to create similar issues as a lot of stuff was changed on screen if the processor was doing a lot of the graphics work. Normally, these days with machines with ssd drives fast multi core processors and dedicated graphics chips you seldom see it unless something very hungry is running as well, maybe a back up or something.

Problems with a VPN 2 messages,"At work I use VPN to login to, when I first load up my computer the VPN screen will pop up automatically and I can put my password in.
However, sometimes I need to access the settings, sighted people can click on a yellow padlock in the corner of the screen but if I type the name of the VPN into the search box and press enter, NVDA will tell me that the program is already running and won’t let me get at it again.
it’s called checkpoint endpoint security.
Does anyone  have any ideas how I can get to the settings of the VPN.Hi,
I have the same VPN at work. I go to the notification chevron, expand it, and go through the programs on the tray until I get the Checkpoint Endpoint, what the sighted folks would call a yellow icon. Right click on it, and you got everything you needed.

Problems with both the SentenceNav add-on and the Sound Splitter add-on.,"Hi, everyone,


I haven't posted to this list in forever, but I'm having a couple of problems, and am wondering if anyone else is experiencing them, as well.

Firstly, the SentenceNav add-on is causing problems with NVDA's Sound Splitter add-on. This add-on causes the keyboard shortcut for the Sound Splitter addon--Alt+NVDA+S--to stop functioning. Once you disable the SentenceNav add-on, the Sound Splitter add-on's keyboard command starts working again.

Secondly, the Sound Splitter add-on is causing NVDA's volume in the volume mixer to shoot up to 100%, and you can't adjust that slider at all; every time you try, the slider just goes back to 100% again. Disabling the add-on causes this behavior to stop.

Is anyone else having either of these issues? I'm running the latest regular build of Windows 11 on a Surface Pro 7.


Thanks,

Public service announcement before going off the air: please install Add-on Updater 22.06 BEFORE checking for add-on updates,"Hello all,
This is the (final) public service announcement before going off the air:
In the midst of messages about NVDA 2022.1 and add-ons, someone reported that they are not getting recent add-on updates. After some discussion, it was determined that Ad-on Updater was not updated to the latest version available (22.06), with the person reporting that add-on updates were offered after installing Add-on Updater 22.06.
For folks wondering why you are not receiving add-on update notices after installing NVDA 2022.1, part of it may have to do with the version of Add-on Updater you have. As I explained countless times (sometimes with joy, sometimes with tears, most of the time with calm), Add-on Updater is one of the first add-ons made compatible with upcoming NVDA releases; in fact, Add-on Updater declares compatibility with a year.1 release as soon as beta 1 is released. This is so that by the time the stable version is released, Add-on Updater can start offering compatible add-on releases to you.
Short of making Add-on Updater a mandatory add-on, as I sign out for the time being, I seriously and sincerely recommend everyone to install Add-on Updater 22.06 (compatible with NVDA 2021.3 and 2022.1). Restart NVDA, and you may get add-on update notices. Plus, Add-on Updater will check for updated versions of itself. I leave you the direct download link for Add-on Updater 22.06 on your screens:
https://github.com/josephsl/addonUpdater/releases/download/22.06/addonUpdater-22.06.nvda-addon
 
See you in July. Thank you for all your encouragements and support (beep, beep, beep, static).

I'm of the same mind.  I've never done anything much to Windows 10 or 11 that I didn't do with earlier versions of Windows.  One of those things was going into Control Panel, File Explorer Options,  View Tab and unchecking the checkbox for Hide extensions for known file types.  I also choose to activate the radio button for Show hidden files, folders, and drives because in my line of work I often need to reference things that are generally ""under the hood.""

NVDA does not seem to have the slightest issue with either Windows 10 or 11 in the ""straight out of the box"" state for either one.

     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedAnother setting that I prefer to have enabled is found under File Explorer options in the View tab. In the tree view is an option titled “show popup descriptions for folder and desktop items.” If this is enabled and if NVDA is configured
 to report tool tips you’ll hear file size information when you are pointing to a drive or folder.

Not quite.  As I reported just the other day when a question came up about the availability of Japanese OneCore Voices, I had NVDA switch from English to Japanese in MS-Word where all I had done was type the first sentence in English and then pasted in the second someone else had written in Japanese.

I don't know what it was that triggered the automatic language change, possibly the recognition of the character set change, but I did not use any language attributes when constructing the document.

If someone wants to ensure language switching then they should make certain to set the language attribute appropriately, though.  Leaving it up to chance is not the way to go.

         ~ Vance PackardBy now, the only method almost 100% sure is based in the
      character set used...
    But, even this method have serious problems...
    How to differenciate between portuguese and english if both use
      the same character set?
    And the same for japanese and chinese, russian and polish and so
      on?
    Linguistic analysis can be usefull, but it is needed, at least, 4
      or 5 words to determine, with some degree of confidence, which
      language is used...
    Remember that in almost two languages of the same character set
      is easy to find equal words, not always with the same meaning, but
      wroten exactly the same way...
    One example in english and portuguese is the word ""use""...
    

    
    I have already tried to set a system to determine the language
      used, but it is impossible without, at least, 4 or 5 words...

If you enable automatic language switching the language information stored in the document will be passed to the synthesizer. And if the synthesizer supports language switching, it will use this new language.

But in any case, NVDA does not perform any language detection natively, e.g. according to character set. It just uses the language provided by the document. In the case of a webpage, the language is coded in the HTML file and thus it is the responsibility of the webpage's author to tag the content correctly. In the case of a Word document, Word has an option, enabled by default, which performs automatic detection of the language when you type a sentence. You can test it by typing sentences of various languages, and then turn back with the caret in each sentence. You can know the language recognized by Word where the caret stands by reading the status bar. If Word does not recognize correctly the language for a sentence or if you want a specific word to be spoken in another language, you can also select the sentence or word and tell Word the language of the selection.

Cheers,

Cyrille


Maybe some extensions canAdditional information:
Probably some extension can provide a language information to NVDA based on the used character set, e.g. provide Russian for cyrillic characters, Japanese for CJK ideographic characters, Persian for Arabic characters, etc.

I think Tony's enhancements does, but you need to configure yourself the association between the character set and the associated language.

Reading Japanese with NVDA 2022.2 61 messages,"The New Releases page said that Japanese was added to Espeak as well as the packaged Braille Tables. I want to learn Japanese (I started learning in school, then left school, and that was a good fifteen years ago now), and just found out the browser version of Duolingo is accessible with NVDA.


However, I've checked with a couple things (I'm a part of a number of anime fandoms), and NVDA doesn't switch to Japanese when reading passages, instead continuing to say ""Japanese-letter"" several times, or if I'm scrolling over it, ""Japanese-letter"" plus several numbers that I suppose are it's unicode designation? But anyways, it is not reflecting the addition of the language bank in Espeak NG. And I know the ProTalker addon has not been compatible for years, though even if it were, there were some weird pronunciation issues with even that.


Is there something I am missing here?Do you have automatic language switching turned on in Speech settings?

Also, and this is not meant as snarky, are you certain you are using Espeak as your synth?  I'd also suggest, once you're certain that automatic language switching is turned on in NVDA, that you give the Microsoft OneCore Japanese a try, if for no other reason than testing.  It does support text to speech.

         ~ Vance PackardAlso, if we’re talking about a Web page the developer(s) of the page need to be using the language attribute correctly. Just having the page being written or displayed in the Japanese language won’t switch the synth language to Japanese
 if English is still being used as the default or primary language.
Of course, if the synth has been set to Japanese and if it’s still not speaking correctly then this is a bit outside of my wheelhouse.

I'll just say that this completely accurate observation can be extended to any document where multiple languages are used.  It is up to the author(s) of said material to correctly specify when a language is switching away from, and back to, the primary language and to specify correctly what language is being switched to.

If none of that's in place there is currently no AI involved as far as knowing that a language has switched.  Switching is directly dependent on the necessary markers being present in the source material.

         ~ Vance PackardThe question is did you switch ESpeak's language to Japanese. With some synths, they just won't work with Japanese or some other foreign alphabets at all unless you add language packs in Windows. I just opened a Japanese Wikipedia page with the following results. Japanese Eloquence read it in Japanese. ESpeak Japanese read Japanese letter this, Chinese letter that. You may want to check out this page about installing language packs in Windows, or find a synth that will work without them.

Shawn KleinEspeak NG, yes. It's the only one now so I just call it Espeak
      out of habit. And yes, I know I'm using it, as I am very familiar
      with the voices and what they're capable of. :)
    

    
    I do have automatic language switching turned on, but not
      automatic dialect switching. Is this important?
    

    
    I don't have any non-English 1Core voices installed and truth be
      told, don't know how I might get more. There was this lovely
      British guy called George who got installed one update and
      disappeared in another, and I miss him. :(I need it to read the English text as normal and the Japanese
      text as Japanese, be it a single line or a passage in the midst of
      English instructions. It does not currently do this and this could
      pose problems when learning. The ProTalker addon used to do it but
      alas...This makes me sad. I just wanna learn the language I had to drop
      in school because I couldn't afford to take the course then, and
      Duolingo is free... But also there is the problem of Kanji
      symbols, which are interpreted as Chinese characters (which to be
      fair, they were first, but not in the context I need them in).
      Getting NVDA to do two languages simultaneously seems to be beyond
      us and I am saddened.Since Eloquence is paid and I don't like it anyways, that's not an option for me. I dunno how, if at all, those packs would help, and I don't want to change synths. Anything without inflection settings (including most paid synths) sounds woeful to my discerning ears.Sharni-Lee wrote:
> I need it to read the English text as normal and the Japanese text as Japanese,
 
As I wrote this can only happen if the Web site uses a specific language attribute in their code when switching to a new language. The code is normally hidden but it tells the Web site, “Hey, this next block of text that I’m about to write
 is actually Japanese.” When writing English text a similar code needs to be entered which tells the Web site, “the following text is in English.” Of course, NVDA needs to have language switching enabled in the Voices dialog, as well.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgI was responding to each message as I read it, so I didn't see
      yours until after I wrote that.
    

    
    I don't think the Duolingo site does this, sadly. I started in on
      Spanish this morning, and NVDA didn't change language for the
      Spanish words, meaning the pronunciation was botched 80% of the
      time by the screen-reader. They have little voice clips whenever
      you press a button corresponding with a non-English word though,
      so at least I won't be botching pronunciations.
    

    
    This will not help me with Japanese if I can't hear the symbols
      being properly identified, of course.Sharni-Lee,
No problem. I would encourage you to contact support and ask them to use the language attribute. For reference, here’s a page which discusses the relevant WCAG criterion.

Settings, Time & Language, Language Pane.  In the Language Pane, activate the Add A Language button.  Enter the language you're looking for in the search box then review the search results (sometimes there are multiple dialects and sometimes multiple voices in a given dialect).  If the intention is for a screen reader to use that language for reading, make sure that the text-to-speech attribute is one of those shown for the specific language item you are reviewing.  There are a number of language items that do not support text-to-speech, though a great many do.

         ~ Vance PackardI've done a bit of Googling about this, and it seems that it's actually whoever created the ESpeak voice's fault. As best as I can figure, they left out loads of kanji and made a real mess of it, so you're out of luck unless someone gets around to fixing it. A lot of ESpeak voices are broken in some way.

This guy outlines a lot of them from a linguist's point of view here.

Shawn KleinI hate to tell you this, but most websites don't even bother with
      that stuff, and when they do it's usually to use the wrong
      language attribute altogether. I turn language switching off and
      never use it lest I end up on a website in English where the site
      builder put in a German attribute. One would think there would be
      an automated way to include them where needed, but I don't think
      there is, and I don't think you're going to convince a website
      owner to comb through his site setting the right language
      attributes for each phrase in a given language on pages where more
      than 1 languages are present. It's been useless from the beginning
      IMHO. People are impressed by the idea, but it's just not
      practical.

As often happens with ""raw URLs that contain odd characters,"" the one you posted broke even though there are no gaps in the text itself.

After the fact on a general purpose website, you're almost certainly correct.

But any website that's supposed to be about language learning, if they care about accessibility (and that, sadly, is an ""if""), should certainly be using language marking attributes correctly.  I'd expect the same for professionally published materials where there is frequent switching between languages, at least for recently created materials.

I once worked with a client who was using materials that were written in English with a lot of Swedish mixed in.  Nothing could automatically read (or OCR) this correctly as there were no language markers and, in the case of OCR, it used either English, or Swedish, but not both for any given pass of the document.

         ~ Vance PackardA lot of synths will read English and Japanese both because they
      don't share an alphabet. The one-core voices mentioned by someone
      in this thread may do this without worrying about website owners
      compliance. RHVoice doesn't support Japanese, but it's free and
      open source, so if nothing else works for you you might want to
      just check on it from time to time and see if they've added
      Japanese. https://rhvoice.org/

Reading document structure information in PowerPoint with NVDA,"Hello all,
I am trying to read a PowerPoint presentation that has bee made accessible:

Each slide is structured with a heading level 1, headings level 2, lists, images with alternatives.
This information is correctly rendered by another screen reader, but NVDA does not indicate any heading level, and on the contrary to HTML document it does not indicate list with X elements.

I had a look at the user guide, but there is only a shortcut for reading presenter’s note.
I tried to disable my extensions, but nothing changes.

In the document presentation, I checked the checkbox to announce styles, but nothing changes.
I use NVDA 2022.2 with Windows 11 21h02 (build 22000.795) and Office 365.

Is this problem a known issue?

Reading long tables in PDF files 3 messages,"Hello everybody

I am using the latest version of NVDA and adobe DC pro 2020

recently I have encountered a strange behavior with reading long tables
onPDF files 

For example table  with 62 rows and 6 columns

The problem is that after the first page of that table, when keep
reading the table in the next pages, NVDA starts to read the column header
twice for each column header. and then after a few pages NVDA read three times
the name of the column header for each cell on the table.

I tried to read this table with several voices and synthesizers and it
seems that this problem keeps occurring with every synthesizer such as windows
1 core voices and vocalizer expressive. Also I have tested this with two accessible
PDF files.

Does nv-access or anybody knows about this issue and what can be done to
fix that?Do we know if the pdf table is actually reading what is there or not, ie, is it intelligently adding the header names, then the maker of the document repeats them, so over time you build up multiples of the text?

Is there any way in Adobe Reader these days to view the entire document without moving between pages. I know there used to be, but since PDFs cause all manner of odd effects, I try to get hold of alternative formats when I can, so I don't use it a lot.

There are just too many, covering an awful lot of territory, to be able to make broad general recommendations.

That being said, the following add-ons are ""must haves"" because of how they enhance NVDA's core code or applications you may be using:
1.  Add-On Updater.
2.  Add-Ons Documentation
3. Mozilla Apps Enhancements  (if you use Thunderbird and/or Firefox)
4.  Windows App Essentials

The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.
        ~ Dorothy NevillIt all depends on what you're using NVDA for. Personally, I only run
three addons, and am probably going to remove one. They are Numpad Nav
Mode, Addon Updater, and NV  Speech Player, though that's the one I'm
thinking of removing as I don't like its voice. Addon Updater is the
essential one if you're running any addons, otherwise it really
depends on how you use the program.I find Toolbar Explorer very useful for unknown software. I also like the sound theme manager formally 3D sound etc, as it adds audio to a stereo sound to help understand some screen layouts.

Most of the others are more specialised and  not used much, but the various addons that announce cut paste, copy etc, can be handy if you are used to that. None of those I've tried is perfect, since there are so many pieces of software that expose the info in an ambiguous way.

SSH issues with NVDA 3 messages,"Hey all,

So I'm facing some issues while using SSH in conjunction with NVDA, it is happening since more than 2 years but I didn't got the time to report it.

I'm using windows terminal and NVDA works really well with it.

Editting the text, navigating, deleting everything is completely fine.

However, when we SSH into a server and try to navigate the text which we have typed, NVDA gives some lag and also I've observed that it reports the characters incorrectly.

Same happens with deleting the text with backspace too.

For example, let's say I've typed: ""sudo""

I'll press left arrow and my focus is on ""u"" however, NVDA may report ""d"" or ""s"" incorrectly.

Why is so?

Has anyone observed these issues?

Am I missing something?
I've used both NVDA Stable as well as NVDA snapshot builds and Windows terminal stable and preview builds, but same issue persists.When you mention the name windows terminal, are you referring to the actual windows terminal software, or just cmd.exe, which is the normal command line application?


Ask since I use SSH on a regular basis via cmd.exe, and, it generally works fine for me in the context of text editing/review?


Otherwise, just in case, would the console toolkit add-on help at all:

Saving An Image From A Webpage In Edge,"Dear all,

I am currently trying to save an image from a webpage in Microsoft
Edge. I tried the more obvious strategies already:
•	Select the image, Applications key, click Copy, and try pasting in a
Word document
•	* Pressing Space, Enter, NVDA+Enter, NVDA+Shift+M followed by
NVDA+[, and other such keystrokes to see if I could open up the image
in a new page
•	* Saved the page in a bunch of different formats (HTML only, .mhtml,
and the usual full page) in the hope that I could edit the document
and get rid of the rest of the webpage contents leaving only the image
(this did not work due to some oddities like HTML only not preserving
any of the webpage contents, .mhtml being an awkward format to work in
and it not being supported by Firefox, etc. but I still think there
might be potential down this route)

A sighted person might simply zoom the image sufficiently, press Print
Screen, and crop the image. I do not know how to achieve that
independently using nVDA and the keyboard. My sense is that there most
likely is a straightforward route to simply save an image from a page
in Microsoft Edge, and I would be very grateful for any suggestions
and advice as to what that may be.

P.P.S. This may seem like a general tech question rather than one
uniquely about NVDA. While the ultimate solution may not leverage any
particular NVDA facility, I think some of the strategies that I tried
not working may reveal shortcomings in NVDA, there might be NVDA
add-ons that may be of use, and my task may be an instance of a
broader category of them for which NVDA users should readily know of a
relatively user-friendly approach.",338,12,0.035502959,0.035502959,1,344,77.29,3.41,69.5,36.9,31.27,19.19,81.4,64.53,53.2,7.85,4.07,3.78,0,0,0,0.29,3.78,16.28,9.3,0.87,12.79,8.72,5.23,4.94,2.03,15.41,6.4,2.62,4.36,0.58,3.49,0.29,17.73,0.29,17.44,3.49,0.87,2.03,5.23,0.87,5.23,0,2.91,2.03,0.87,0.87,0.58,0.29,0,0,0,0,3.49,2.62,0.87,0.58,0,0,1.16,0.58,0,0,0,0,2.91,0,0,2.91,2.62,0,0,2.62,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,0.58,0,0,0.29,0.29,3.49,11.05,0,1.16,6.98,2.62,0,0.29,2.33,1.45,2.03,3.2,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,18.31,5.81,5.52,0,0,0.29,6.69

Silencing NVDA for Layout Tables 3 messages,"A question about how to do this just arose in the Microsoft Office Accessibility Discussion Group.  I knew this was possible because at one point I needed to get rid of it myself.  In searching for that information today, I also noticed several posts saying the ability to do so had been removed from NVDA settings, but it hasn't.  I don't know if it moved or not.

Credit Luke Davis in message  #62176, in topic, Removing items from a table with NVDA, on the NVDA Group dating from May 2019:

It is probably what NVDA calls a ""layout table"". To test, the next time you are in one of these, do this:

Press NVDA+ctrl+b (Opens NVDA browse mode settings).
Tab four times (You should be on ""include layout tables"").
Press space (Should uncheck ""include layout tables"").
Press enter.
----
I did not test the ""Tab 4 times"" part, and there's a chance the settings have been rearranged since 2019, but that checkbox is still there.  If 4 tabs don't get you to it, you will eventually hit it.

It does help.

This is precisely the reason I stopped, at least a couple years back, writing instructions that relied on number of TAB hits.  Things get changed and rearranged too often.

Now, if I were writing something like this myself today, I'd just say, ""Navigate to (or TAB until you arrive at) the checkbox for 'Include layout tables.'""  I got tired of hearing things like, ""I tabbed 4 times and it's not there.""  The idea that one might want to keep exploring in the event of a typographical error or change in layout just doesn't seem to occur to some.

Skipping the advertisements in web browsers. 25 messages,"Hi,Is there a simple way to skip the advertisements in a webpage?Instead of pressing the down arrow key several times till the end of the advertisement, any simple way to reach the next required text or data?Also, a same way to skip the form fields in a page?Any help would be much appreciated.Thanks,Ravi.One way to remove advertising is to use an ad blocker.  uBlock
    Origin is a well thought of ad blocker.  It appears to be better
    than another popular one, Ad Block Plus (spelling.)

    

    Another way to block ads is to use the Brave browser.  

    

    GeneRavi,
Regarding ads you can do more than skip them. Why not block them with an ad blocker such as
UBlock Origin.
Because ad blockers are not relevant to NVDA itself it would be better to talk about this type of software on the chat subgroup.

The Window-Eyes screen reader had this capability and I can see why it would be useful but I don’t believe there’s a way to do it with NVDA. If the capability
 exists in a third party addon I’m not aware of it but I certainly haven’t looked through all features in all existing addons..

www.DavidGoldfield.orgWhile in browse mode, you could try using the letter b to move by
    button.  Most forms have a submit button at the end and most fields
    in forms aren't buttons.  I haven't tried this, but that may be the
    fastest way to get to the end of forms in general.

    

    GeneThanks David. Because some times when form fields are repeated, even the advertisements repeats in a page, it is annoying to keep moving till we find the next text.As you both suggested I have added the UBlocker now.     Thank you,Ravi.Gene,
I think you’re right in that searching for buttons may be the fastest way to move to the end of a form. It’s not 100% guaranteed that it will work in all cases since some forms might have more than one button but I think it’s the best that
 we can do for now.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgThank you Jene.Let me try this way.Have not noticed that they end with a button. Will focus on that  too.Regards,Ravi.However, be aware that this is a bit like a war. The sites rely on advertising to pay for them being free to the public. When you block adverts, often this can be seen by the site who might decide to deny access until you allow adverts again. Its all part of the commercial reality of life, sadly.
What to my mind is needed here is some kind of add on that displays adverts separately from the pages, rather like a split screen system, so the badly formed inaccessible ads we often encounter do not make the actual site almost impossible to navigate for us, but still allows us to see or hear the adverts if we want them.

    GeneOne website that I know won't show content if adverts are disabled, is ITV online catch-up. I like to watch The Chase quiz show online, but it won't play the episodes if the browser has an ad blocker active. ITV are even more strict than this, because if you are watching a show and skip to a different webpage (or web browser) while an ITV advert is playing, the advert will pause until the ITV window has focus again!

Same here, virtually never.

I am not doubting those who say they've encountered them, but they are, overall, the rare exception.  These days I do get some sites that ask me to turn off my ad blocker, which I don't do.  For that very rare website that has refused entry or otherwise misbehaved badly when an adblocker is in use, I find an alternative.

I haven't browsed the web without either an ad blocker add-on/extension or using a browser like Brave or Vivaldi that has ad blocking built-in for many years now.

The rise of the link-button or button-link has mystified me as well.  The only reason I can think of to favor this device is because it is a lot more visually distinct than hyperlinks are, and buttons draw visual attention in a very different way than hyperlinks do.

I hate the things because unless I do a hover over with the mouse I can't honestly tell someone whether what they're dealing with is a real button or a hyperlink dressed as a button.

Just the word ""Submit"" that's marked up to be clickable.
I've seen that on countless forms.
Bad practice in my book.

Jason BratcherIf so, when you are at a form, searching for the word submit should
    place you on it and thus at the end of the form.  Screen-reader
    search on web sites is one of the most valuable and underused

    GeneWell I don't mind adds but its been known that adds can potentially lead to malware.

I was on a site I used to frequently use.

It displayed adds and I worked round them.

But one day I was asked to install programs and other activex in internet explorer.

I also had sites trying to download trials and other junk onto my system.

Anyway I contacted the owner to find out yes they did use an outsourced add system.

And this is where the danger is.

They had no control of what was on that server or who could use it.

They immediately stopped using that system and switched to another but adds while a potential accessible issue are also potentially dangerous.

Solution for NVDA Remote on the IPhone with Bluetooth keyboard lacking NVDA key.,"Hi, I accidentally paired my Matias keyboard with my phone as if it was a Windows or Android device, and low and behold all those Windows keys that the IPhone doesn't care about and don't work in apple mode like NVDA and applications actually go through to the phone and can control your NVDA on your Windows machine. Now I need to see if I can trick the IPhone into letting me pair the keyboard twice, once in Windows mode on key 4 and once in Apple mode on key 2. Probably not, and I'm not going to try it now, but one of these days. My Bluetooth on the PC bit the dust, and in trying to fix that connection I accidentally unpaired the keyboard with the phone, and then accidentally paired it again using the wrong key so that the keyboard thought the phone was a Windows or Android device.

I just got a new logitech H870e headset and was getting an echo or reverb like sound when using it with NVDA. Initially I thought it was just with NVDA but the same thing happened with narrator, and then I pulled up a YouTube video and lo and behold, actually all the audio coming through the headset exhibited this echo. 

Long story short, you go to Control panel, hardware and sound, click sound, right click on the audio device exhibiting the issue, go to the advanced tab of the dialogue that pops up and uncheck the option “enable audio enhancements,”hit apply then OK. For me, this immediately removed the echo. Hope this helps somebodySorry. I missed one step. When you right click on the audio device exhibiting the echo, choose properties from the context menu. Then you get the dialogue I mentioned in the next stepI had the exact same issue with my first laptop, and the solution was
similar. Unfortunately, that also decreased the speaker volume by
about 20%, but outside of certain circumstances, that was fine for me.Yes one persons enhancement is another persons pain in the neck. They all seem to have such gadgets applied on particularly laptops recently. Maybe its to make the sound appear better than it really is.

If you mean game tunes, masterboot record has most of that covered.

If you mean playing with floppy drives mrsolidsnake770 has that covered.

This should be on chat though but you are a mod here so.

What about playing with midi files with your collection of soundfonts.

I have a collection of fonts from musinkite and arachno which are custom made general midi fonts to things like yamaha, nokia synth and creative cards even a gravis ultrasound and sega, and nentendo units so there is that I guess.

Fiddling withh chip composition softwaree, there is plenty of chip music about.

Recording sounds in particular with em pickup coils.

I have one though not used it for ages.

They are easy to pickup and easy to aparently make.

Doing things like sticking something into something else or using a old hard drive magnet as a wind chime or sticking a stainless steel bowl into a drier, recording those and making those into instruments.

I think andrelouis recorded an old broken hard drive and made bits of it sound like a chime, and got an instrument out of it.Shaun Everiss wrote:

The member who originated this message has been warned that spamming the group absolutely will not be tolerated.  But since it is possible that spoofing could have been involved, he has not been banned.

But any repetition of spamming, whether the member themselves originated it or it was done because an email account was compromised, will result in a banning for the email address from which those messages originate.  If an account cannot be resecured by changing password then we cannot keep membership active under an address that remains compromised.

While this may be true, it's not up to me, or any reader, to ferret that out.

Note how my own signature is clearly designated in the way that's been a convention for decades now:  it is preceded by the ""two hyphens and a space"" deliniator.  And if you happen to be using the Groups.io signature feature, that gets put in by the software for you.

But if you are using other software that isn't, then you need to make sure that's included yourself.  Again, it's been common netiquette for decades now, so it shouldn't need to be pointed out.

Speech History Add-On 9 messages,"I know that James Scholes  was the one who coded the add on, but it does not appear to be compatible with the latest NVDA. Can someone please tell me I’m wrong here? Here is the link to the add on on the nvda page. https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/speech_history.en.html I didn’t see it under legacy which is making me curious now.  Thanks. I also didn’t see it update in the add on updater which is odd as it I think has before but don’t quote me on that.I tried installing it in the current NVDA version and it was blocked
    because it isn't compatible.

    

    GeneWhat's available at this very moment for the Speech History add-on is not compatible with NVDA 2022.1.  Even the add-on file includes 2021.1 in its name, which is a big hint.

I believe that Mr. Scholes may have been just the tiniest bit ""late to the party"" in issuing his official update.  See the GitHub Page for Speech History, where, as of the moment I'm typing this, there are entries for making it compatible with NVDA 2022.1 logged 21 hours ago.  An update is clearly in the pipeline.  I can't say precisely when it will exit said pipeline.

     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedAnd, based on this post by the author in the NVDA Add-Ons group, https://nvda-addons.groups.io/g/nvda-addons/message/18933, it would appear that the only update that was required was to the manifest, in this case, and that a pull request is pending so that Add-On Updater will recognize the latest version.

A direct link to the latest version is also in that post for those who want to manually update.

Spelling / grammar checkers - I found one! 17 messages,"Hi everyone,
Turning on my PC this morning, I got a suggestion from Microsoft to install their ""Editor"" plug-in.  These suggestions come up now and then and I usually ignore them, but since it looked to be the kind of thing we've been talking about recently, I was intrigued.
I can confirm it does work!  Essentially, it's a bit like grammarly - when you are typing in an edit field on the web (I used the Edge plugin but there is a Chrome one as well which I assume should work too, since both browsers are based on Chromium), it puts a red underline for spelling errors and a blue one for grammar - not dissimilar to Word.  NVDA doesn't buzz at you for an error, but when navigating it tells you that you have an error on that line, and reads it when you get to it.
You can find it at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/microsoft-editor

Twitter: @NVAccessYep. I’m using it now and love it sans it quirks. But over all, it works quite well. Give it a try.Hmmm well chrome does have one checking via google spelling
      dictionaries so I don't need it but good find quentin.
    And its a microsoft app to so well we know it works.Is there something similar for Firefox? I know Firefox has a built-in spellchecker but it does not offer correction suggestions unlike in things like Microsoft Word.Are you talking about the flag words as you type?  That feature says
    misspelled when you come to a misspelled word you have written. 
    This works the same way as the feature does in every program I've
    used that has it.  When you are on the word, open the context menu. 
    You will see suggestions by down arrowing.  Press enter on the
    suggestion you want to replace what is in the document.  The menu
    closes and the word is replaced.

    

    GeneHi Quentin On a lighter note. That plugin you talk about sounds fantastic, but can you imagine the trouble I’ll have when writing in Afrikaans. Regards Christo Vorster (Worcester South Africa)I think so yes. Is this already part of Firefox somehow? Cause when I pressed the application key with the misspelled word highlighted I don't see any menu items that lists suggestions.Chrome has a spelling checker, however no grammar checker. Plus you have to hit alt down arrow for the word checker to give you only 1 correction which sucks. It is usable, yes, a bit of a PITA when you hear “3 errors on this line” and you cannot  see what they are until you pass over them and have to hit alt down arrow.Don't use alt down arrow. When you are on the word, open the context menu and down arrow.  You will see many suggestions if the misspelled word is one where the spell checker believes they are useful.  

GeneNo, in the grammar checker for word,  you must use alt down arrow to see the suggestions per the hint that is given.  But per the regular spell checker yews contextual menu is correct.You were talking about Chrome.  And I'm not talking about running an
    f7 spell checker.  I'm talking about the flag words in the text
    function of Chrome. 

    

    GeneTher is a grammar checker for chrome that is an extension. It si written by microsoft. It is the same one used by word, that is the one of which we are speaking. This is not the native google spelling checker that ships with the chromium browser.

    add-on, which I haven't used, I can't discuss that.

    

    GeneI should say that someone was asking about Firefox and I discussed
    the spell checker in Firefox, which is the same or very similar to
    the spell checker used in other browsers.  I hadn't realized you
    were talking about the add-on.  I may play with it.  Is it the one
    Quentin wrote about yesterday?  It is a Microsoft add-on and he
    began the thread and gave a link to download it.

    

    If you don't recall his message, I can send it to you.

    

    GeneSure is. I use it. Give it a play in FF and see if NVDA reads out the stuff it needs to read out. It should, assuming it works in FF. I’m still learning btw.Thanks for the sharing.

    screen-reader command.  So is up or down arrow to move from item to
    item in a list.

    

    GeneWell, why I use move to next or previous paragraph hotkey in a
      list, is that when an item contain more than one line,

    
    moving by ctrl up or down arrow, nvda
      will read the whole list item.

      check the checkbox informing you know what you are doing, and

Suddenly realized that NVDA+SHIFTC or +R cannot set column or row header 2 messages,"Hi all,

A few weeks before I was still able to set the column header or row header using the hotkey NVDA+Shift+c or NVDA+Shift+r.

Today when I try to do the same thing in excel, it just typed the character c or r into the cell, but has not triggered the set header function of nvda.

I try doing the same thing with a portable version of nvda and it words, so I am wondering there is something wrong with my current installed version of NVDA. The installed NVDA is 2021.3.5.

I have tried the following things but nothing has resolved the problem:

1. reset input gesture to factory default

2. restart with addon disabled


Would you please instruct me on any other possible solution that I can resolve this problem? many thanks.


WilliamAfter my initial post I found that the problem was initiated by enabling UIA support for Excel.

Switching to a paper login at a website 9 messages,"Hi all,

See the page at the below link.
https://www.interactivebrokers.co.in/sso/Login?RL=1

The above link is the login page for my stock broker. I have a live trading
facility and a paper trading facility.    The default login is live. There
are 2 items above the user name box live and paper. I want to activate the
paper option. 
How do I do this? I have tried object navigation and hitting enter and also
switching to forms mode on that item and hitting enter without success.

If this is the case for a physical mouse, I do have a USB mouse connected to
this machine. Brian, can your mouse pad advice work with a USB mouse or
should I switch to an  optical mouse?
PranavPranav, focus on clickable item, reroute mouse cursor to it, and, activate mouse click?


Can't test it, but, would think it might work?

""Resistance is futile...but, acceptance is versatile...""Open the dev console with ctrl+shift+i. In the edit box, type:

document.querySelector('span.switchery').setAttribute(""role"", ""button"")

Hit enter, close the console with the same key and hit the button that should've appeared.Hi Tyler,

A very clever solution. However, my hitting the resulting  button did not do anything. I tried with both google chrome and firefox. 
I however explored some more and found an unlabeled clickable item after the user name edit field. I hit enter on that and was able to switch to paper trading mode.

PranavPranav,

In general, mouse advice is mouse type agnostic.  It applies to old style mechanical mice with the rolling ball, optical mice, and mouse pads on laptops.

If you look at the source code for this page that paper versus live toggle (and it does appear visually as a toggle) is implemented as a checkbox.  Yet, for some reason, it is entirely inaccessible via screen reader.

Not knowing why you're trying to activate the paper option, I do want to let you know that doing so makes the entire background on the login screen go red and a red frame with the word SIMULATED (all caps) appears as a frame around where you enter your login credentials.

TesseractOCR add-on 16 messages,"Hello!

Released version 2022.05 of TesseractOCR, as first public version...


• Authors: Rui Fontes rui.fontes@... and Angelo Abrantes ampa4374@...
• Updated in 28/05/2022

• Download stable version:

https://github.com/ruifontes/tesseractOCR/releases/download/2022.05/tesseractOCR-2022.05.nvda-addon

• Compatibility: NVDA version 2019.3 and beyond


*** Informations

This add-on uses the free and open source Tesseract OCR engine, to perform optical character recognition on an image file, PDF, JPG, TIF or other, without the need to open it.

It also can scan and recognize a paper document through a WIA compatible scanner.

In the Preferences of NVDA, it is created a cathegory, TesseractOCR, where you can set the language to be used on the recognition and the type of documents to be recognized.


*** Shortcuts

The default commands are:

Windows+Control+r - to recognize the selected document;

Windows+Control+Shift+r - to scan and recognize a document through the scanner.

Then just wait that ocr.txt opens with the recognized text.

If you want to preserve the recognized text, don't forget to save the document under another name and in another location, as all files in the temporary directory are deleted at the start of the next OCR process!

This commands can be modified in the ""Input gestures"" dialog in the ""TesseractOCR"" section.


*** Automatic update

This add-on includes an automatic update feature. The check for a new version will be executed everytime NVDA is loaded. If you want this, go to NVDA, Preferences, Options and in the add-on category check the check box.


*** Known problems

• This version only works in 64-bit Windows.
• When selecting the ""Various"" option in the ""Documents type"" combobox, the recognized text probably appear with many blank lines This is a known problem with Tesseract, and, without consumming lots of processing time, I haven't yet found any solution. But, I still haven't given up!


*** Languages supported

The supported languages in this version are: Afrikans Amharik Arabic Bulgarian Burnese Catalan/Valencian Chinese simplified Chinese traditional Croatian Czech Dannish Deutch Dutch English Finnish French Galician Georgian Greek Hebrew Hindi Hungarian Icelandic Indonesian Irish Italian Japanese Kannada Kirghiz Korean Lativia Lituanian Macedonian Nepali Norwegian Panjabi Persian Polish Portuguese Romanian/Moldave Russian Serbian (Latin) Slovak) Slovenian) Spanis Swedish Tamil Thai Turkish Ukrainian Urdu Vietnamese


*** Image types supported

This add-on supports the following types of files: PDF jpg tif png bmp pnm pbm pgm jp2 gif jfif jpeg tiff spix webp


Best regards,

NVDA portuguese teamHi Rui,

1. Does tesseract have any advantages over the windows built-in OCR?
2. How is this add-on different from the now add-on?

PranavHello!

Comparing with NAO, it have the following differences:

1 - Use of Tesseract OCR instead of Windows OCR, and for me it is better...;
2 - Different exibition of results, TXT instead of a specific interface;
3 - TesseractOCR do not make OCR to the screen;
4 - TesseractOCR can make OCR from a paper document through a WIA compatible scanner.

It is a large add-on due to the need of the files needed to recognize all the languages supported...

I have try your add-on. found that it can work well. But there are some suggestions + some bugs I'd like to inform you about.

1. buck it's cann't remember the Config value
when restart NVDA your add-on config value always reset to default

2. I find that you use folder images as cache for add-on functionality.
This would be nice if the folder was cleaned regularly. for the privacy of user data

3. If possible, I find that tessdata makes the add-on large. and for most users They may only need to use a few languages. This means that not all language options are required.
So is it possible? If the add-on has a language option for the user to choose and then download and install it. Without including all language tessdata files in the add-on's installer.

Thank you for your development It is of great benefit to the community.Hello!
    

    
    Thanks by your words!
    1 - I am going to check, but I think if you make changes and save
      them or have NVDA to save changes on exit they are preservved...
    

    
    2 - The images folder is cleaned each time you start an OCR
      process...
    

    
    

    
    Or if the files are stored anywhere in GitHub...3 - I have to

Thanks for this add-on. I have been trying to get it working, but can't seem to get my scanner to scan. Does it have support for twain scanners? or does it just support WIA devices? Also, I can't find anywhere to specify which scanner to use as my system has more than one. I would like to use a twain scanner if possible. Do you know of an add-on which allows use of a twain scanner for OCR?

Very best wishes,

Mo.Hello!


You can try this one:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/n78xf7022gdbsqr/NAPS2TesseractOCR_2022.06.nvda-addon?dl=1


It contains only a few OCR languages, but you can import the ones you need through the configuration panel included in the NVDA settings.

If it do not detect automatically your scanner, try to do the following:

1 - Go to %appdata%\nvda\addons,

2 - Go to NAPS2TesseractOCR, globalPlugins, NAPS2TesseractOCR, naps2-6.1.2-portable;

3 - Execute the app NAPS2.Portable.exe,

4 - Tab until Main Menu;

5 - Arrow right to Profiles and press Enter;

6 - Tab until Edit and press Enter;

7 - Shift tab untill Driver WIA;

8 - Arrow down to Driver TWAIN;

9 - Tab untill Select device, press Enter and select your device;

The Gmail website with NVDA 13 messages,"Hi all,
Well, I've been meaning to get off this list for a couple weeks now,
but new questions just keep popping up. This one has to do with the
GMail website and NVFDA. Since last September, whenever I log into my
GMail account, it loads standard view, despite me having had it set to
load basic HTML by default before then, and it changing on its own. I
was telling a friend about how I was considering moving to using Gmail
with Outlook, and she was telling me that she was able to switch back
to having basic HTML as her default view. This is the same friend who
I was mentioning last week with Zoom, so her primary screen reader is
JAWS. I think she said she uses Chrome as her default browser, and I
use Firefox. We were talking about this on Zoom just now, and she told
me that there was a button at the top of the page that says ""basic
HTML."" As my laptop is a touchscreen, I was able to swipe to the left
and find that button, but when I double tap on it, NVDA simply says
""activate,"" but does nothing, and I can't seem to get to it using the
normal keyboard commands. How do I access this?

You need first to get off the web navigation mode.
This is done by pressing nvda+spacebar.
You then may tab or shift-tab to the button labelled html basic and
press the spacebar to activate it.
Remember to get back to the navigation mode so that you are able to
use navigation keys again.

Hope you find this in order.

Absolutely, regardless of whether it's a short or longer term break from receiving individual messages.  You also have the option to get a daily digest or a summary instead of individual messages.

Of all the preposterous assumptions of humanity over humanity, nothing exceeds most of the criticisms made on the habits of the poor by the well-housed, well-warmed, and well-fed.
    ~ Herman Melville (1819 - 1891), US novelist & sailorBrian,
I actually meant to post this a couple weeks ago when you last posted
this message but was looking at the list on my phone and then forgot
when I got back to my computer. Do I need to resume mail before
posting a topic to ensure I get all messages about that topic, or is
it like some discussion boards where you can subscribe to individual
topics?This did work, though it seems odd that NVDA won't see that button in
browse mode. Gene, your link showed as visited in my browser, which
means that when I open my history to access the basic HTML view,
that's where it goes. My friend seemed to imply that if I used the
button on the top of the standard view page it would ask if I wanted
to set Basic HTML as my default view, which it did not. I will have to
ask her if she has one of those links bookmarked or if she just goes
to gmail.com and logs in that way.It doesn't.  It may have at one time, I don't recall, but that can't
    be done now.  Even when the offer existed toward the end of its
    presence, it didn't work.  

    

    However you do it, make it a bookmark or use history to open the
    simple HTML page, if you want to go directly there, that is how it
    is done.

    ~ Herman Melville (1819 - 1891), US novelist & sailorWhat is lost using simple html? I guess what I'm asking here, is why did they change it if the two do the same jobs and the only difference is one is more accessible than the other. I'm all for simplicity, and the whole Google experience seems a bit peculiar to me. I have now got it back working in Imap and pop3, which at least means I can see the spam folder, but I guess I'll never be able to create a white list of people any more.

The Japanese 1Core voices have failed my first test of them 16 messages,"I saw a post on one of my friends' Tumblr blogs with two short
      passages of Japanese in it. I took the opportunity presented to me
      to test out the Japanese 1Core voices I had installed.
    

    
    I tested with all three of them (they probably use the same
      logic, so I didn't necessarily have to do that I suppose), and was
      soundly disappointed by the results. Espeak identified the strings
      of characters as Japanese-Letters. When I read the same text with
      the 1Core voices meant to read Japanese, I got silence.
      It read the Latin characters in the distorted way I had expected,
      although NVDA switched to Microsoft David when reading actual
      English words and sentences. The Japanese passages, however, were
      simply treated like lines of unidentifyable/unassigned characters,
      with complete silence. I could not even scroll over them character
      by character with the left and right arrows and get a response
      from them!
    

    
    For reference, this is the post I discovered this problem with:
    

    
    https://kintatsujo.tumblr.com/post/690881533161144321
    

    
    I do not need or want a translation, I just want this behaviour
      verified by someone else.All I can say is that page is just so horribly formatted that what one will get from it is unpredictable.  When I was using Microsoft David and have the two Japanese voices (and Ayumi was the one that was being used) what I would get was so random that I don't know what's going on.  At points I would get really long passages in Japanese and I have no idea what was being read.

When I copied a short caption under a cat picture, and pasted it into MS-Word, then prefixed it with a sentence in English, here's what was read that I've placed on my Google Drive in MP3 format.  It's an MP3 file of about 11 seconds duration.

In NVDA settings my voice is Microsoft David, I have automatic language switching turned on, and have none of the add-ons referenced earlier in terms of language switching installed.

The minute you (any you) are thinking, ""I know that site's a mess,"" then having any expectation of consistent or expected behavior by a screen reader goes out the window.

There are a lot of sites where the visuals for those who can see are quite nice, but the underlying HTML used to generate them, upon which a screen reader is far more dependent than eyes are, is an unqualified mess.

In my last pass at the site you linked to I was getting the same behavior you described, where it was as though the text in Japanese did not even exist.  I can't explain the exact reason for that, but just the kinds of inconsistency I got when attempting to have NVDA deal with this page over several separate attempts tells me it is not a valid test case.

Since I don't speak Japanese I have absolutely no idea whether what was read in Japanese was read correctly or made any sense at all.  But I'd have to presume a native speaker of Japanese is not putting nonsense captions under her posted images, either.

         ~ Vance PackardHi,

for the record, using one core japanese voices, it seems it doesn't read the lines if automatic language switching is on, but it does read them properly if it is off.

-- PatrickOh, okay, interesting!


I've also noticed that it will switch from an English voice to Ayumi when reading Japanese if a file containing it is opened in Word, but not in Jarte. I kinda knew Jarte couldn't handle Japanese before—The last time I tried to open my very old Memrise-based practice files in Jarte, the characters showed up as strings of question marks. This time they showed as characters, but weren't processed in Jarte when using the 1Core voices. They were in Word so that's okay I guess.


I suppose I ought to test and see if I can read Japanese on Duolingo with the 1Core voices. Here's hoping it works and I won't need the IME for the first lesson...Hello,

As far as I can tell Jarte is a very old app and does not support unicode which is very important in a situation like yours. Even build in Windows Wordpad is more preferable since it supports unicode.

The last update (6.2) dates back to April, 2018, and the previous one to that was in May, 2017.

This is not a product I would be relying on in 2022 as it appears to be out of support or woefully neglected.

         ~ Vance PackardIt doesn't matter any more because I have had MS word since last
      year, so I can use that, but I'll need to find/install the IME
      again, as I've not done it on this computer since I didn't know
      when I'd have the opportunity to learn.
    

    
    The first lesson in Duolingo didn't seem to have any visible
      characters, just buttons that played sounds. I'd have to keep
      going with it to see what shows up, though I have been able to
      read a couple things with Ayumi and she doesn't mess up
      pronunciations in her native tongue, which I suppose isn't
      especially hard to program with a language that has more firmly
      established pronunciation rules than the ever-mutating,
      grammar-stealing monstrocity we call English.It's fine for what it is/what I use it for, which is a writing
      program for when I want to keep things simple. I still use it for
      writing my stories out of habit.
    

    
    It's more of a framework built over Word Pad, or in a similar
      vain to it, and it works just fine for what I use it for.It's built on an old version of Wordpad.  I don't know which one,
    but it is a preribbon version.  

    

    Its fine for working with formats such as rich text.

    

    GeneI can't, and won't, tell people what they can and cannot use.  But I will tell them that relying on out-of-support software (and I do mean relying, rather than occasional or frequent casual use) always eventually leads to heartache when it suddenly breaks and will never be fixed.  Then you have to scramble to find a replacement under pressure rather than being able to do leisurely evaluation of alternatives.

I thought I had remembered Jarte as being officially unsupported, and they don't say that anywhere but on their support page:  ""Support is no longer provided for Jarte. No further development of the Jarte program is expected.""

         ~ Vance PackardIt isn't supported but just expecting it to suddenly break is very
    unlikely.  Wordpad, either in the current version or older versions,
    is a simple program.  I really doubt that something in Windows is
    going to change so it no longer works.  I'd bet that if you still
    have the old Wordpad files from the Windows 95 version, that it
    would still work.

    

    In talking about programs breaking over time, I think you have to
    consider the context.

    

    GeneGene,

I do consider context.  What I have stated has long been considered best practice.  I'm never going to say otherwise.

The new Microsoft Store version of Quick Assist - Access with NVDA 10 messages,"For those of you that use Quick Assist and have done so with the original version in recent days, you will get a notice that a new version is now available from the Microsoft Store and that encourages you to download it.  If you do then ""the fun begins,"" in several respects:
1. You still have the old version as well as the new version on your machine, and the keyboard shortcut to invoke Quick Assist still invokes the old version.
2.  If you invoke the old version after the new is installed, the initial dialog will ask you if you wish to open the new version, and that's presented as a link near the bottom of the initial dialog.
3.  For me, anyway, the initial dialog of the new Quick Assist is inaccessible, but in a weird way, about which more, below.

When the initial dialog is opened, NVDA has focus on the entire dialog and NVDA is in focus mode.  I cannot seem to force a change to browse mode, and other than the announcement that I am in the Quick Assist window/dialog, I get absolutlely no other information.  I cannot figure out, for the life of me how to get out of browse mode and into the ""guts of the dialog.""

I can do this ""the sighted way"" and click on the text at the very start and, after doing so, everything is accessible in exactly the way I'd expect.  But I'm having no success either with conventional commands or object navigation in making this transition to the actual dialog content occur.

I don't need any assistance with Quick Assist itself, but am wondering if anyone has had any success with getting into the initial dialog where you either request assistance by entering a code your assistant gives you or set yourself as the assistant and get that code to provide to the person you're assisting.

        ~ Joshua LiebmanHello,
    Here is how I solved the problem. While the focus was on the whole
    QuickAssist window, I've used NVDA's command to move the mouse
    cursor to the currently focused object (which in this case should be
    the whole QuickAssist window) and them simulated a single left mouse
    click. That moved the focus inside the QuickAssist window/document.
    This has to be done each time the QuickAssist program is launched,
    but it is still better than nothing.

        ~ Joshua LiebmanThanks for the heads up on this one!
Is there some way to get this input to MS for ease of use improvement?
RussHas feedback already been sent to ms about this? This seems like a gross oversite on their part. I don’t use QA, so can’t really be of much help.Yes. Simply hit windows plus f and choose the relevant category for which the feedback should be sent.  You can then record what happens and send it to them, or send a screen cap of the window all from within the app.The two primary methods of providing feedback to Microsoft, about anything, are the Feedback Hub and, for users of Assistive Technology, and the US Microsoft & Windows Accessibility Support Webpage or UK Microsoft & Windows Accessibility Support Webpage.

Talking to Accessibility Support representatives, regardless of how you decide to reach out to them, is the most direct way to ensure a human has heard about the issue and, if you're lucky, will note this in the call notes and forward same to someone who may be able to take action on these.

I haven't tried Narrator with this.  But the same thing happens with JAWS, too.  It was this issue being brought up on one of the JAWS groups that launched my noodling around with NVDA and new Quick Assist.

Just the JAWS and NVDA data points make me think that Microsoft has to fix something.  But it's also good to know that until they do, a workaround exists.

Trouble with Groups.io 27 messages,"Hi:  I know this should be on the chat group, but I have had a problem with my email.  I didn't receive messages for about 24 hours.  I had my son's help to get messages back for the nvda email, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this message.  I am questioning if I have been blocked out of my email address for that reason from groups.  I can't even get a link sent to me to get on the groups.io.  I don't use the groups.io web site enough to have a password for them.  Can anyone help here, as far as a hint to get to where I can resubscribe to the group emails that I have been on from groups.io for several years?

DaveWe got your post, so presumably, things are working fine.

If something happens and emails from groups.io bounce, you will get a message from them with a link to follow to unbounce your account.As a side note, although this is not in the group rules, I have often mentioned that the occasional question about Groups.io itself, and how to use the service or problems with it, are OK.  If you can't get a mailing list service to work (regardless of which one) there's no point in having it.

The above having been said, if you have suddenly stopped receiving Groups.io messages, whether individual messages, digests, etc., that you have been receiving for years and have not received any notices from Groups.io either immediately prior to or after this happening, I'd be getting in touch with your email service provider to see if they can figure out if there is an issue on their end.

If you check with friends/acquaintances that you know from Groups.io groups, and confirm that they're still getting messages, then you can be quite certain that Groups.io itself has not suffered an outage.  And if there's no Groups.io outage, and your message spigot seems to have been turned off, it's not likely to have occurred other than on the receiving end, that of your email service provider, rather than the sending end.

easiest way. ""--

Dave,

I have documented how to get yourself (the generic you) setup to be able to log in to the Groups.io website in:  Establishing a Groups.io Website Account Password If You’ve Been an E-Mail Only User (docx)  as well as how to change your email address for all groups.io groups you're already subscribed to, in one fell swoop, using the web interface to do so:  Changing the Email Address for Your Groups.io Account (docx)
 

So there are both tutorials posted again.

You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.
     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedI'm not writing this to give you a hard time, but you do need to
    finish setting up your account.  It isn't a question of how often
    you use the site.  You regularly use the groups and without a
    password, you cannot efficiently ddeal with problems even if they
    occur rarely.  

    

    It is no more difficult finishing signing up than it is for any
    other typical site.  You evidently were bouncing.  I haven't had
    enough bouncing problems to recall just what needs to be done.  I
    think that if you have been bouncing, there is one unbounce link you
    work with to unbounce your account, not every list separately.  If
    you were bouncing, you should have gotten an unbounce link.  If you
    don't see one either in your regular mail or in your spam filter, I
    believe you can unbounce yourself in the your account which you need
    to be signed in to access.

    

    I think even using the unbounce link requires you to sign into your
    account to be unbounced  once you follow it.

    

    GeneI saw your message stating that you aren't receiving a logon link
    that you sent to another list.  That is why I said you need to
    finish setting up your account.  You need to be able to log into
    your account if problems like this exist and you say you can't now.

    

    GeneThey don't have a link for forgot your password.  There is a place to enter your email address, and they are suppose to send a link to login, but I have tried twice today, and no link yet. It's about 3 hours from the first time it should have been sent. I had to use the subscribe address to get 3 of the list, but no luck, as far as the rest of my list.  No bounce message when server was reloaded on our part.

DaveActually I don’t use a password for groups.io, never have. I just sign in using SSO from google.  It works a lot better IMHO.He is right. You don't reset your password, you just click log in, one site I use that has this as well is odysee where you enter your email, you get sent a link and you click it to log in, no need for a pwd.I am not familiar with SSO.  Usually, when I login somewhere that
    allows you to sign in using Google, that is presented as an option
    on the login page itself.  No such option is present on the
    Groups.io login page.

    

    I don't know if Dave can create an account.  I believe a
    verification e-mail is sent to your mail address.  If the login
    messages are going to spam, which Dave for some reason isn't seeing,
    perhaps the verification message will, too.  If your method will
    allow him to sign in and avoid that possible problem, that may be
    important to try.

    

    GeneSarah,


That is incorrect with regard to groups.io unless something has changed radically.  You are required to establish a password for website access on activation of the link sent.

Now, you can remain logged in under any given browser for a long time after having logged in.  I use the web interface almost exclusively and can't remember the last time I actually had to log in.  My session cookie lasts for months, that's for certain if I don't intentionally log out.

     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedHi:  I see my spam bright and clear.  A lot of my messages are
      still going into spam or what is called junk after the break of
      the system this last weekend.  I'm clicking on the send a link 3
      times as of now, which the first time was around 10 o'clock this
      morning.  That is why I ask the question on the list's.  The link
      is good for 24 hours after it comes, of which is suppose to come
      within seconds according to the site of groups.io.  In which case
      it is not nice to claim something for assumption when you don't. 
      That is one of the worst things you can do in the computer world.
    DaveWhat can be done if groups.io won't send a link?

To be clear, if you have subscribed successfully using a given email address to any groups.io group an account is already established with that email address being the login ID for the account.

Trying to help a friend with Code Factory voices 10 messages,"I'm trying to help here in Mexico, who bought the Code Factory NVDA voices directly from Code Factory, and he's having the problem that he's sure he's installed the voices on 2 computers: home and work. They gave him a 3rd computer at work (a Laptop), and here's where the problem lies: He wants to install the 3rd license on his new Laptop, but upon typing in the key, the system talks about a 7-Day trial pmiod.
So where can he EMail Code Factory directly to see what's going on? And do you have how many activations with Cf 2 or 3?
Thanks for any help you guys can provide.

Gera
Enviado desde mi iPhone SE (2nd Generation) de TelcelIt's probably the trial demo. Since it's a 3rd computer. I believe three computers is your limit. However, do make sure that you deactivate the licence on say that work computer when not in use anymore. Because if it gets taken away from you, then you only have two license keys left.they need a better system to manage licenses. I don't like what they have. what if you forget you had a license on a computer?Normally these companies are pretty relaxed if, for example a computer dies and you need to get a new install, I find.

So are you saying, that in the situation where one can't retrieve there license, Code Factory could give you an extra key back to your account?


Obviously, one shouldn't abuse this and know before hand the limitations of the licensing system but if Code Factory can give you a key back in situations like a computer suddenly dieing on you then that's reassuring to know.My friend was asking me if maybe when he updated NVDA and had to update the voices, he neglected to put the activation back on the server before updating, thus lost one of his keys upon updating?

Gera
Enviado desde mi iPhone SE (2nd Generation) de TelcelI didn't do that, and I was fine.  As long as your computer ID doesn't change, you will still have 2 keys, or is it 3? I hate the online system they have, it's antiquated.I wish we could just go to a website and reset our own keys, like you can reset your jaws license keys.As I understand the authorization system, it relies on the
    synthesizer contacting the server run by the company to verify that
    the product is registered once a month.  That means that if the
    server is down, if the user is not on the Internet for some reason,
    or if the company goes out of business, the synthesizer won't
    function until some provision is made.  I haven't looked into the
    keys question but I consider the need for monthly verification to be
    a very serious defect.  Once a product is authorized, it should stay
    authorized.

Good day gentle people

I trust you are all well.

I am trying to cope.

I would like to ask you for an assistance.

I am working with big files and folders and have to share them with my
assistants.

I know that google drive can help me to do this.

However, due to my little knowledge of drive, I need you to assist me
in finding a step-by-step tutorial on google drive using NVDA.

Your assistance is appreciated in advance.
Marisane: SAGoogle has quite a few tutorials on this, and all of them are returned in the top ten search results:  DuckDuckGo search on Google Drive Screen Reader

I could have sworn that one of our semi-regular contributors of YouTube tutorial content, TheeQuinn, had done a tutorial on Google Drive, but a quick check of her YouTube Videos Page indicates I was mistaken.  Still a resource for using NVDA with a huge number of programs and web apps that's worth mentioning.

      about Thunderbird Version 102 in one of the JAWS groups and here
      as well.  From the JAWS Group:

      ----

      What I can't figure out is why anyone who is not a typical beta
      user is upgrading to Thunderbird
        102.  From the noted page: Thunderbird version 102.0
        is only offered as direct download from thunderbird.net and not
        as an upgrade from Thunderbird version 91 or earlier. A future
        release will provide updates from earlier versions.

        

      There could be quite a few changes before it hits the
      release channel.  Those choosing to use beta software need to
      understand what that entails.  I still have 91.11.0 and a check
      for updates from the help menu clearly indicates that's the latest
      version on the release channel.

      ----

      And in this group, in message #97152, I
      noted that the developer of Mozilla Apps Enhancements reported
      that there were known issues between that add-on and Thunderbird
      102.  I have not kept up on this, since 102 is not on the release
      channel yet, and I expect that beta software will sometimes have
      issues and that they often get fixed provided beta testers report
      them in the months leading up to a release candidate.

      

      And while the above may have absolutely nothing to do with the
      exact issue raised here, it is essential to remember when using
      any piece of software that is not a part of the official release
      channel at the time it's being used.

    I downloaded the 102.0 from within Thunderbird a few weeks ago. Just
    yesterday, the program auto updated from 102.1.0 to 102.1.1.  This
    is when I first noticed the status bar issue.

    

    So explain that Gene! It's liked the twilight zone.

      Whatever the case, in a later message, you said that the version

      I see links to download Thunderbird.

      Here is the first download link and you will see that it gives the

      I used the copy  link feature of Firefox when I was on the

      I don't know where you are looking but the page I just gave the

      In short, you are using the latest nonbeta version.

        I can tell you this.  When I use the NVDA keystroke to read the
        whole screen for desktops insert + B, (useful in dialogues and
        other things that sometimes don't automatically read) if you
        listen to all the verbiage, finally at the very end, the status

    update directly to 102.x.  The program may  first update you to an
    earlier version and from that earlier version the next update may be
    to 102.exe.  But if you have a recent enough version, you will get
    an update to 102.exe.

    

    I updated last night.  The version I got last night is 102.1.1.

    Closed the about dialog with control f4, not alt f4.

    GeneHere is a correction.  Close the about dialog with either escape or
    alt f4.  I thought the dialog opened in a new tab but it is somehow
    a dialog even though it presents itself as a web page.  It closes in
    the usual way about dialogs close.

    

    GeneHi Gene,

    

    Of course I have been doing this for years now.  BTW, with Mozilla
    products, to close windows of any kind, control + W also works. It
    never fails.

    

    I do have an old Thunderbird 102.0 executable version on my old
    computer. I always download the current release version a few days
    after I am updated within a program of any kind including
    Thunderbird.  I am going to save all my mail and then do a total
    uninstall and reinstall of 102.0 and immediately block any further
    updates under settings. I will keep things that way until further
    notice. Maybe, I'll even take your advice and run any future full
    releases as a portable version first before doing a full install--a
    kind of shake down cruise.

    program, then uninstall the version you are running and install the
    one you want.  If you delete the profile folder in the new copy, and
    paste the profile you saved to the same location, you will have all
    your messages, the address book, and I would imagine anything else,
    such as add-ons, though I don't know about add-ons and other items.

    

    Those who know more about this may comment further.  I'm not sure
    where the profile is in the installed version.

    

    But if you are talking about saving all your messages and
    transferring them using a different method, and manually exporting
    and importing the address book, placing the profile in a new copy of
    the program eliminates the need for all that work.

    

    I'll add that those were my results, playing with the portable
    version.  I expect them to be the same if you are copying the
    profile in an installed version or from an installed version to a
    portable version.  I haven't verified that.  

    

    You may want to manually save what you want to save, then try the
    copy profile method so that in case it doesn't work as I expect, you
    won't have lost anything.

    

    GeneThis method of finding and copying the profile folder to a new
    installation should work:

    It is a long description.  New main steps start on new lines.

    Open help in Thunderbird, alt h.

    Down arrow to trouble shooting information and press enter.

    Tab until you get to a button that says open folder and press the
    space bar.

    You are now in the profile folder.

    Back space once.

    You should now be on the profile folder.

    Copy it to the clipboard.

    Close where you are with control f4.

    You are now in the main program window.

    Close it.

    Paste the profile folder wherever you want.  You are copying it in
    that way just as you copy any other folder.

    Uninstall Thunderbird.

    Install the version you want.

    Follow the same instructions to get to the profile folder and be at
    it not in it.

    Then alt tab and close the program window.

    

    You will be back in the folders and files list.  Delete the profile
    folder.  Copy the old profile folder folder to gthat location.

    

    Now close the files and folders list with alt f4.

    Open thunderbird again.

    You will be back in troubleshooting information.

    Use control f4 to close it and you will now be in the main program
    window.

    

    See if everything has been transferred.

    

    If so, there is no more to do.

    

    GeneHello all,
    
      Just to let you know, that I'm experiencing the same issue in
      Thunderbird 102.1.1. The problem was only partially present in
      Thunderbird 102.1.0 and older, but not in version 91 - there the
      status bar was readable with NVDA with no problems.
    When I noticed it occurring in v102.0.0, I filed a report against
      it here: 1777805
        - Status bar reading with NVDA fails if ""Spaces Toolbar"" is
        shown (mozilla.org).
    I also noticed and reported another bug, related to the ""Spaces""
      toolbar and navigation with F6, which may be related to the status
      bar reading, but I'm not sure. Here is that other bug report: 1777804
        - Keyboard navigation with F6 and Shift+F6 gets stuck with pref
        `mail.tabs.autoHide=true` and `Spaces Toolbar` hidden
        (mozilla.org).
    In v102.0.0, I also noticed a bug with activation of the link in
      the headers panel for an RSS news. This was fixed in v102.1.1, but
      then the status bar reading with NVDA got broken. Coincidence (?)
      - I don't know. Here is that bug report: 1777802
        - RSS feed URL link in the headers panel cannot be activated via
        the keyboard (mozilla.org).
    I'll report the issue with the status bar reading with NVDA from
      v102.1.1 in this report: 1777805
        - Status bar reading with NVDA fails if ""Spaces Toolbar"" is
        shown (mozilla.org). Feel free to do the same, to attract
      the attention of the Mozilla developers to this regression.
      Hopefully it will get fixed soon.

No, Gene, the page is not worded incorrectly.

The most recent RELEASE UPDATE CHANNEL VERSION is 91.12.0. 

There is no direct update to 102.X on the RELEASE UPDATE CHANNEL because that version is not yet on that channel, which is the one where production releases reside and automatic updates occur.

If you have manually updated, at any point, to a release such as 102.X it will continue automatically updating along the release channel it's in, but that is not the usual production release channel.

The 102 series is a beta.  A rose by any other name . . .

         A personal thanks from me for being a living, breathing, and excellent example of what a beta user (regardless of the software involved) should be doing when using such.  This is how kinks get worked out before software is formally released to the general public via the ""usual release channel"" for that software.

         ~ Vance PackardHi Group,

Has anyone upgraded Thunderbird to the latest version 102.1.1?  If so, can you read the status bar?  I cannot on my system: Windows 11, 64 bit with latest NVDA 2022.2.

    and it still isn't.

    

    I'm going to check to see if there is even supposed to be a status
    bar any longer.  We don't know if it has been removed.

    

    GeneI just did a Google search and didn't find anything in the first
    five results about it being removed.  I looked in the view menu and
    it is still there and checked.  I tried unchecking it, then checking
    it again with no results.

    

    It may be there but not accessible to NVDA and perhaps other
    screen-readers.

    

    I used NVDA key b to read the entire window and the status bar
    wasn't read.

    

    GeneThis may be something NVDA will have to update.  The status bar is
    still read when using JAWS.  Whether Thunderbird or NVDA should
    correct the situation is something I'll leave to the two sets of
    developers.

    

    GeneI have made posts about Thunderbird Version 102 in one of the JAWS groups and here as well.  From the JAWS Group:
----
What I can't figure out is why anyone who is not a typical beta user is upgrading to Thunderbird 102.  From the noted page: Thunderbird version 102.0 is only offered as direct download from thunderbird.net and not as an upgrade from Thunderbird version 91 or earlier. A future release will provide updates from earlier versions.

There could be quite a few changes before it hits the release channel.  Those choosing to use beta software need to understand what that entails.  I still have 91.11.0 and a check for updates from the help menu clearly indicates that's the latest version on the release channel.
----
And in this group, in message #97152, I noted that the developer of Mozilla Apps Enhancements reported that there were known issues between that add-on and Thunderbird 102.  I have not kept up on this, since 102 is not on the release channel yet, and I expect that beta software will sometimes have issues and that they often get fixed provided beta testers report them in the months leading up to a release candidate.

And while the above may have absolutely nothing to do with the exact issue raised here, it is essential to remember when using any piece of software that is not a part of the official release channel at the time it's being used.

Update On My Incompatible Add-Ons 3 messages,"Hi Group,

I took the radical step of simply changing the manifest.ini for some of my add-ons that are listed as incompatible with NVDA 2022.1.  I know this is somewhat dangerous, but for simple, non essential type things like Extended Winamp and phonetic reading, I gave it a go. The following add-ons work when using this inefficient method.

extended Winamp
enhanced phonetic reading
clock
day of the week.

Again, this is a radical step and over time, if these add-ons are not rewritten, there will probably be problems. But as a stop gap until people update, this might be something to consider. I advise doing this one at a time, exiting and restarting NVDA and seeing if there is any deleterious effect--not only for the add on itself, but for NVDA in general. Who knows what this kind of Gerry rigging might cause.

Updating NVDA 10 messages,"Good morning all,


Trying to update my NVDA onto my new Win 11 machine; from 22.1 to 22.2.  Something dreadful happened that now did not allow me to get into the NVDA setup menus past the second level.  I got to preferences, settings and to the multi-page box.  Tried to tab into any of the choices (general, speech, Braille, vision, etc.) the menu crashed and went back out to the main screen.  Going to tools, manage addons, it would not show any of my addons.  So I downloaded 22.2 and tried an install that did the same thing.  So I thought the thing to do was to remove NVDA and start over. That's quite a job; but I think I did get it done, between the uninstall app that's in the NVDA folder and the windows add/remove programs app.  Now NVDA won't install; it gets so far and crashes.  So I'm forced to use a portable earlier version of NVDA running from a thumb drive.


Anyone know of a fix for this?  It's become quite a stumbling block.  The machine was starting to look just the way I wanted it.


Thanks.

HowardFetch a fresh copy of the 2022.2 installer from the NVAccess download page, uninstall your current 2022.X, and reinstall.  At least try that first.

         ~ Vance PackardI have removed old version of NVDA in two ways; don't remember
      which order:  1. Using the executable that's in the NVDA folder,
      and 2. Using the windows add/remove.  As far as I can tall, it's
      gone; unless there's stuff left in the registry or in some other
      folders.  I do have a copy of 22.2 that I downloaded yesterday. 
      I'll give it another try.
    

    
    <HT>There; tried it again.  Looked like it was gonna work; Ended with
      two error sounds and spoke ""secure desktop"" twice and
      insttallation failed; then dropped out to listing my downloads
      folder.  Could it be that I have a corrupted download of NVDA?
    <HT>At times, a download may be corrupted.  If you tried again, it is
    very unlikely that the second download will be.

    

    You may recall that when you reported all sorts of problems trying
    to use Thunderbird Portable, I said there might be something wrong
    with your system.  This next unexpected problem makes me continue to
    wonder that.  There may be something wrong with your system that is
    corrupting information on the hard drive, perhaps a memory problem,
    perhaps something else.

    

    If the computer is still within the exchange period, I would
    seriously consider exchanging it.  You shouldn't be having these
    sorts of unusual and unexpected problems.

    

    GeneAlso, have you had other unusual and unexpected problems you haven't
    discussed such as having to reinstall something that stopped working
    correctly for no known reason or had data disappear or become
    corrupted?

    

    GeneI agree with Gene that if you have been having ""peculiar errors"" with this machine, and it is new and within the return/exchange period, that's precisely what I would do.  If it's beyond the return window, and still within warranty, I would not send it in until you have tried the following, and either one or both have not fixed the issue, I'd send it for warranty service.


Whenever any inexplicable issue presents itself in Windows “out of the blue” and with seemingly no reason, these are the two things I try first, in order:
1. Using DISM (Deployment Imaging Servicing and Management) and SFC (System File Checker) to Repair Windows 8.1, 10 & 11
2. Performing a Windows 10 or 11 Repair Install or Feature Update Using the Windows ISO file
If #1 fixes the issue, #2 is unnecessary.

Upgrading Windows with NVDA 16 messages,"Hello all.


As written in the subject, is it possible to upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11 using NVDA? I think this is called windows anytime upgrade or something like that. I just wanted to know, if that is possible with NVDA or if there is a certain point, from where i would need a sighted person to help.


Regards

DanielYes, in-place upgrades can be done without sighted assistance.  Once they're kicked off you will have periods of silence while they're doing the work that needs to be done and the machine will often reboot several times during the process but just pick up where it left off.  Eventually, when everything's done, you're back at the login screen.

If your computer is suitable for Windows 11 you should be being told that in the Update & Security settings, Windows Update pane.  In fact, if it qualifies you should have some sort of link that would kick off an in-place upgrade, but being that I don't have a machine where that's the case, I can't say what the exact phrasing on that link is.

If your machine does not qualify for Windows 11, there should be a message that reads, ""This PC doesn't currently meet the minimum system requirements to run Windows 11""  There are occasions where that is because a given setting that needs to be turned on is not turned on, as opposed to the hardware not being sufficient.  Directly beneath that message will be another about PC Health Check, and a link Get PC Health Check, which you can activate to have the PC Health Check download and run to verify whether you have insufficient hardware or the hardware is OK but something else needs to be tweaked.

If your computer has an Intel i-series processor it must be 8th generation or newer (a number after the dash, e.g., i5-8493, that is 8000 or higher) to be Windows 11 compatible.  If you already know you have an i-series that's first through 7th generation, you cannot update to Windows 11.

    There is also one issue that I don't' quite understand as far as
    upgrading to Windows 11.  When I tried upgrading my older Windows 10
    machine to Windows 11 as Brian Vogel has suggested, windows itself
    told me I had passed the test.  But when I then began the upgrade, I
    got a message to the effect that the process couldn't continue
    because of some sort of issue with the bios security.  I was told to
    contact my motherboard producer for further information .

    

    I don't know just what this message meant, but that's something to
    be aware of.

Because Windows Update with NVDA questions are going to keep arising in cycles here, I am going to answer this even though it's not directly NVDA related.

This sort of error message is generally the result of one or both of these factors:
1.  You have a very out-of-date UEFI/BIOS installed.
2.  Your UEFI/BIOS has the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) function turned off, even though the required TPM is actually present in your hardware.

The best bet is to go to the support page for your make and model from the computer manufacturer, first, and see if there is a BIOS update.  If so, get it and apply it to see if that alone solves the problem.  If it does, you're good, but if it doesn't you are going to need a sighted assistant to ""flip the switch"" for TPM function on in UEFI/BIOS since there is no screen reader support prior to the operating system itself booting.

The message you get when an update halts should be pretty specific about exactly what it is that caused it to halt, so you can act accordingly to make whatever correction is necessary.

Same here, not too terribly long after the initial release date.  The only thing I'll argue is that anyone should have been, or be, a ""poor unsuspecting user"" since this update is clearly identified, and optional, much like normal Feature Updates are now in Windows 10 so long as the version you're using is in support.  If you don't activate that ""Download and install"" link it's not going to happen, and the what that would be downloaded and installed is very clearly identified.  Any time someone encounters a ""Download and install"" link they need to have reviewed ""the what"" before choosing to activate it.

I can't disagree with you.  In this life, though, the old saw ""once burned, twice shy,"" should apply and particularly if you've done/allowed something you had not intended in the past.  Most will learn from that.

I say the following in all sincerity:  You can't fix stupid and/or complete inattention to anything.

But being either stupid or just not paying an iota of attention will never, ever, make someone ""poor and unsuspecting.""  The use of the ""Download and install"" link as consent for doing the two things it says is now years old.  If you can't, don't, won't pay attention to it over 7 years into the Windows 10 era then the problem with something downloading and installing is not that you have not been warned.

I have a lot of sympathy and empathy during the periods of major change, but when it comes to this and because that major change occurred years ago, both sympathy and empathy are gone.  And that extends these days to those who've clung to Windows 7 long past its official retirement date by Microsoft when the update to Windows 10 has been, and still remains, free.

As I said initially in response to a post by Quentin Christensen there is a significant advantage of being part of an update cohort when ""everyone's doing it"" rather than waiting years after the vast majority were updating.  That, too, is a choice.  And given my personal and professional experience, I have no hesitation about saying it's a poor one (and I take the use of assistive technology into account).  Not being on either Windows 10 or 11 in 2022 is just a bad, bad choice.  And I don't know of a single person in the technical support business who would say otherwise.

in the display name field.I do disagree, but only on machines which run legacy software as this one does. It is the only reason this is still on 7. Sadly things we need have never been made reliable in Windows 10. Indeed the operating systems simply put them out and left them orphaned off completely.

However if its look and feel you want to change, there are things like Open Shell which do a good job at making the change far less hassle.

If you can name even five I would be shocked.  I've been doing this way too long to believe that practically anything that ran under Windows 7 won't run under Windows 10, and that's not even using compatibility mode.  Once you add that in, the number gets much smaller.

I think I've had one machine with one piece of XP era software that didn't make the cut.  I've also installed plenty of old software (as in predates Windows 10 by years) under Windows 10.

Using NVDA remote via an iPhone? 9 messages,"Hi all
I saw an article about how to use NVDA remote add-on on our Chinese NVDA community website. It told that iPhone can also control my computer by this remote add-on, because there is an application called ""NVDA remote"" on iPhone.But after I connected successfully, I can only open the NVDA menu, and all keys I pressed after that were invalid. I was still controlling my iPhone, not my computer. The key “F11”, which is used for switching control between iPhone and my computer, doesn’t work. My bluetooth keyboard which is used for controlling my iPhone is logi K375s. 
Does anyone have a solution? Thanks a ton!
Best regards
BonnieHi Bonnie, f11 isn't necessary on the IPhone, you're already
      controling your PC as soon as you connect with both devices. You
      need to have the same host usually nvdaremote.com and the same key
      on both. but should you need to press an f key on Windows,
      remember that on the IPhone the f keys control media functions
      unless you press them in conjunction with the fn (function key) on
      your keyboard. Also remember that the alt and windows keys will be
      reversed because of how Apple maps them. So when you want to alt
      tab, what you really must do is windows key tab, which is actually
      option as far as your phone is concerned. Alt becomes command, and
      therefore it becomes windows in the remote program, so press alt
      to get to the start menu where you would normally press windows.
      So for an example, to alt+f4 close a program you now need to press
      fn+option+f4, which is the same key as fn+windows+f4. You will
      also need possibly to press left and right arrows simultaneously
      once to turn off the quick nav that you probably forgot you have
      on constantly for your IPhone. If it's on, arrow keys won't do
      what they normally do in Windows and you will wonder why you can't
      read documents. Also, there is a long delay in when Voiceover
      speaks what is coming from NVDA, so you have to get used to that.
    Shawn KleinHmmm, I didn’t know that.  I wasn’t sure if you can control the Pc using an apple product such as the I Phone.  I know if both the Pc and the Android phone if it does use NVDA. I think you  can control the computer using your windows phone.   Sent from Mail for WindowsOh I forgot. You said you got the NVDA menu, so maybe you have a
      working insert or NVDA key. My Mathias Bluetooth keyboard that can
      pair to 4 devices and switch between them doesn't have another
      insert key. When controlling NVDA the numpad insert is always 0
      even with numlock off on the pc, so you need the other insert key
      unless you have your NVDA key set to caps lock. But I had to
      remember that for my keyboard you have to use fn+delete on the
      middle 9-pack which normal keyboards have the 6-pack to get the
      insert key. Your keyboard may not have this issue, but this is for
      anyone who has it. Another thing with the remote on the IPhone,
      since input is really fast, but speech output is slow, output just
      keeps building up on the phone if you're just using your NVDA
      speech and ignoring the IPhone speech as I was doing to remind
      myself how all this works, so Voiceover ends up several commands
      behind yacking about stuff you did a minute ago lol. So if you
      wanted to use your phone as a long range wireless keyboard for
      your pc you'd probably want some other wireless way to get audio
      directly for NVDA unless you're ok with the very delayed output
      from the phone. I'm very tempted to get an FM transmitter for this
      purpose.

    
    Shawn KleinHi Shawn 
Thanks so much for your kind help! It's really detailed.
Now I want to switch the control of my iPhone and computer freely. After I controlled my computer, I want to control my iPhone again. What should I do?
I also find that if I close the screen of my iPhone, the remote will stop. Is it right?
Finally, now I have to turn off my voice-over to use the TTS speech engine. When I turn on voice-over again, the remote will also stop. Therefore, I can only control one of the two devices. Is it right?
Thanks!On Mon, Jul 25, 2022 at 10:42 AM, zhu bonie wrote:

-
As a general observation, this is true of remote software of all types that I've ever worked with.  One side is ""in control"" while the other is ""being controlled"" and those roles cannot be switched once they have been established for a session.
 
If I'm the person giving assistance/controlling from one end, the person being assisted on the other cannot flip-flop the roles to become the assistant/controller, nor can I as the controlling side hand that off to them.

The difference between a top-flight creative man and the hack is his ability to express powerful meanings indirectly.
         ~ Vance PackardHi, I never tried the TTS, just Voiceover, so I can't tell you
      that one, but as soon as you press the home button on your phone
      you'll be out of the NVDA remote app and can do other things on
      your phone with the keyboard I would think. I actually haven't
      tried that either, I usually just use gestures directly on the
      phone to disconnect the NVDA remote app when I'm done. I really
      haven't actually tried to use it for any length of time, so never
      really needed to switch from using it to doing something on my
      phone, but if I did, I would just use the phone's screen and the
      home button to navigate away from it as I would if I weren't using
      the keyboard at all.
    Shawn KleinThis is very true, but RIM previously mentioned on this list can actually do that now, in addition to allowing copy/paste of files and folders between the controller and the target.

Using NVDA with Windows 11 IOT & RDP 8 messages,"Greetings,
I wanted to see if anyone has used NVDA with Windows 11 IOT from another computer using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and if there are any tips/tricks that you can share.
I don't know if Windows 11 IOT supports this without any additional software installation/configuration.
I also don't know if Windows 11 IOT supports Narator with the initial installation.
Thanks for anything you can share!
RussThere was an interesting demo of NVDA and the beta of Remote Incident Manager on last weeks Mosen at Large podcast. Sounded like the answer to many prayers, except the pricing when it comes out after the beta version. Just my view.

Thank you for your response
My Understanding is that Remote Incident Manager is intended to pick up where Quick Assist left off...I think it may also be more integrated with things like MS end point management.I don't know if it will be a replacement for things like Remote Desktop Protocol 
Which provides a user with general remote access to another computer
I'm interested in knowing if anyone is using NVDA with Windows 11 IOT as compared to Windows 11 Desktop.I don't know if Narator is included in Windows 11 IOTI assume these will be supported so it may be a matter of installation/configuration
Thank you
RussI could quote small later parts of the message to bolster my case,
    but this should be adequate.

    

    Thank you for sharing this article and for allowing the discussion!

    I enjoyed reading the article and was not aware of some of the
    history.

    I was reading the article using Firefox and NVDA

    I ran into multiple accessibility issues while reading

    Probably because I was reading using explore by mouse...  :-)

    

    If the person wasn't reading the article as that appears to
    indeicate he was, I'd like to know.  He has never said he didn't. 
    If he says he didn't and explain what he did, I'll be happy to
    address that.

    

    Nothing I said is unclearly stated and it is the reasonable
    understanding of what he says he did.

    

    GeneHi,

In theory, yes, you can install NVDA on Windows 11 IoT Enterprise and connect to that system via Remote Desktop Connection, but remember that Windows IoT is really meant for specialized scenarios.

Cheers,

JosephThanks
Take care
AndrewHi Joseph,
Thank you for your response!
I'm not surprised and pleased to hear that Windows 11 IOT will support the NVDA screen reader.
I'm also pleased to hear Windows 11 IOT will support RDP clients.!Do you know if:The RDP support on Windows 11 IOT is part of the default installation?The setup on Windows 11 IOT is similar to what was done in the past on previous Windows versions?
Thank you, this leaves me thinking I will be able to work with these special devices running Windows 11 IOT!  :-)
RussHi,

RDP: I think so as Windows 11 IoT Enterprise (that's the actual name of the SKU, by the way) is a version of Windows 11 Enterprise designed for IoT scenarios. But that's where the similarities pretty much ends. That's why I said ""in theory"" when talking about installing NVDA on a remote IoT device - I expect admins to be using Group Policy and other mechanisms to lock down the device in some way.

Cheers,

Joseph",573,20,0.034904014,0.034904014,1,575,51.7,17.55,57.28,81.12,23,24,82.61,64.35,49.22,13.04,7.48,4.17,0,1.91,1.39,0,5.57,10.61,5.22,2.61,13.22,10.09,3.13,6.26,1.91,19.83,5.57,2.26,1.74,0.7,0.35,0.7,15.83,0.52,15.3,3.83,2.26,1.39,3.83,0.17,5.57,0.17,4.17,4,0,1.91,1.74,0,0,0,0,0,11.48,6.09,2.26,1.57,0,0,3.65,5.22,0,0,0.17,1.39,0.87,0,0,0.87,5.22,0.17,2.78,1.91,0.17,0.17,0.35,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,0.17,0,0,0,0.52,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,0,0.7,3.13,7.3,0.52,1.04,4.7,0.7,0.52,0,2.61,4.87,5.91,1.74,0.52,0.35,0.17,0,0,17.04,5.91,2.96,0.35,0.87,2.96,4

CheersHi,

It’s been a couple years now but at my last employer we were just starting to use Tableau pretty heavily and I found it to be almost completely inaccessible so I ended up getting placed on a different project where it was more about writing actual SQL queries and not dragging things around in some visual designer.

Therefore, I will not release add-on updates of any kind throughout June 2022. Don’t worry if I don’t respond to you on a timely manner about my add-ons – consider me offline.See you all in July.Cheers,JosephHave a nice break.

something else doesn't go wrong be out of the office for 4 days or so

Its hard to take a techbreak, luckily my phone aint smart so I don't
have to bother about that but yeah, seriously conciddering going

No, it is not backward compatible.

"Voices in Italian, French, German, and Spanish Languages 6 messages","Hi Group,

A friend of mine in Turkey is interested in voice files for NVDA in
French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages.
Is there a website he can go and download those files?
Your help would be appreciated.

Facebook: m.facebook.com/LiteraryBrailleProofreaderWhat version of Windows is he using?  If it's Windows 10 or 11, I know there are OneCore Voices available in all of those languages.  Microsoft has a support page listing all of the TTS Languages available for Windows 10 and Windows 11 (and each version of Windows has a separate tab on that page):  Appendix A: Supported languages and voices

Settings,Time & Language, Speech Pane, Add Voices button.

I'm sure these exist for other synths as well, but I have no idea what the acquisition method is.

I believe he uses Windows 10.
He finds the voices that come with Windows very robotic and would like
human-sounding voices.
I would appreciate if you or anyone else would provide me the info to
get such voices in the languages mentioned in my original message . ""--

Then best of luck to him.  The OneCore voices are about as human sounding as I've ever dealt with, which is why I like them so well.  Many have complained that they do not do well at very high speech rates, but the speech rate I deal with is pretty much the average human speech rate.  It seems that the ""robotic sounding"" voices can be sped up to insane rates with better results, but I can't understand what they're saying at that rate, anyway.

years ago Microsoft offered the RealSpeak Steffi (later Scansoft) as its German  SAPI5 voice for free.

"Web developer issue with NVDA reading the word ""us"" 7 messages","Hello! I am a web developer who recently started working with NVDA. I am having an issue that the screen reader is reading the button ""Contact Us"" as ""Contact U S"" (as if I was referencing the United States). Is there any way to get the reader to read the phrase correctly?Jarrett,

A couple of points for your edification, then the workaround/solution:

1. NVDA is not responsible for the actual reading output of anything.  That output comes from the synthesizer of choice.
2. Another synthesizer may not have trouble with a capitalized ""Us,"" while it's almost certain that some others will do the same thing.
3. This is probably because the synth is trying to make an educated guess for ""Us"" in isolation from what surrounds it.  It would have the logical choices of it being an abbreviation for United States, in which case it would choose to say U S, or that it's a typo of ""us.""  Clearly the synth in use is making the former presumption.

The easiest way to fix this is via the NVDA speech dictionary.  See my tutorial, Using the NVDA Dictionaries with Regular Expression Matching to Change Pronunciations (docx), even though, in this case, we will not be using regular expressions.

For step 3 in the tutorial, you would enter (without quotation marks) ""Us"" in the pattern box.

For step 4 in the tutorial, you would enter (without quotation marks) ""us"" in the replacement box.

For step 6 in the tutorial, activate the radio button for whole word.

I would also choose to activate the option to make this match case sensitive, such that only ""Us"" will be matched.

This topic was simultaneously introduced on the Chat Subgroup and additional detail was offered there.  It's clear that the issue is not with the word ""Us"" but ""US"" when the phrase, ""CONTACT US,"" in all caps is spoken.

Thus, pattern should be CONTACT US in all caps, replacement should be contact us all in lowercase, still use whole word and case sensitive options.

    ~ Herman Melville (1819 - 1891), US novelist & sailorThis behavior is so wide spread that I had thought NVDA had been
    programmed to send text to the synthesizer to cause it in this
    case.  But I finally found a synthesizer that doesn't read
    capitalized US as u s.  I use DecTalk with System Access to Go on
    the rare occasions I use that screen-reader and it reads the
    capitalized US as the word us.  I tried e-speak with System Access
    to Go and it spoke US as u s as it does in NVDA.

    

    I tested four or five synthesizers and DecTalk  was the only one
    that did this so it appears this is a wide spread behavior of
    synthesizers.

Which is absolutely no surprise.  Nine times out of ten (more, really) all caps US is short for United States, but understood if U and S are read as letters.

Strings of all caps are generally considered to be ""short for"" something else.  Some are pronounceable while others are not.

    ~ Herman Melville (1819 - 1891), US novelist & sailorYes sometimes you get strange things on buttons like the hotkey for it in brackets inside the word which also can be quite amusing to listen to being read.
Would it really matter though if web sites did not capitalise US at all?

in the display name field.Hi,
    As has been pointed out elsewhere in this thread, most
      synthesizers will pronounce ""US"" as ""U S"" because that is
      generally what is intended. Good directions have been given for
      modifying the speech dictionary for NVDA to get an individual's
      set up to read it as ""us"". However, as a web developer, if the
      idea is to add something to the button on the webpage itself so
      that synthesizers read ""US"" as ""us"" instead of ""U S"", and if
      ""CONTACT US"" is desired for visual aesthetics, then the best
      option is to add an aria-label to the button definition, like
      <button ... aria-label=""Contact Us"" ...>CONTACT
      US</button>. This will cause screen readers to read the
      button label as ""Contact Us"" instead of ""CONTACT US"".

MathCAT is designed to eventually replace MathPlayer because MathPlayer is no longer supported. MathCAT generates speech and braille from MathML. The speech for math produced by MathCAT is enhanced with prosody so that it sounds more natural. The speech can be navigated in three modes using the same commands as MathPlayer. In addition, the navigation node is indicated on a braille display. Both Nemeth and UEB technical are supported.

MathCAT adds a settings menu to NVDA's preferences menu. In the settings menu, numerous options in MathCAT can be set to control the speech, navigation, and braille.

For full user documentation, please see the MathCAT User Documentation. For information on the MathCAT project in general, see the main MathCAT Documentation page.

Who should use MathCAT:


Those who need high quality Nemeth braille (MathPlayer's Nemeth is based on liblouis' Nemeth generation which has a number of significant bugs that are technically difficult to fix).
Those who need UEB technical braille
Those who want to try out the latest technology and are willing to help by reporting bugs
Those who use Eloquence as a voice



Who should NOT use MathCAT:


Anyone who uses MathPlayer with a non-English language (translations will be coming in the future)
Anyone who uses MathPlayer with a non-Nemeth/non-UEB braille output (contact me if you want to help out with a braille translation)
Anyone who uses MathPlayer to read Chemical Formulas (that will hopefully show up in the next non-bug release)
Anyone who prefers Access8Math to MathPlayer (for speech or other features)



MathCAT's rules for speech are not yet as extensive as MathPlayer's rules -- that may be another reason to stick with MathPlayer. MathCAT is being used as a testbed for ideas for MathML 4 that allow authors to express their intent so that ambiguous notations can be spoken correctly and not guessed at. I have held off on adding too many rules since the architecture of MathCAT is centered around using and inferring author intent and these are not fully settled yet.",350,20,0.057142857,0.057142857,1,350,79.45,35.16,7.76,36.57,25,30.29,80,59.14,46.29,9.14,4,0.57,0,0.29,0,0.29,5.14,11.43,6,1.14,14.86,8,2.57,5.43,1.43,15.14,5.71,3.43,2.86,0.57,0.29,2,17.14,0.29,16.86,2,5.43,4.29,4,0.29,3.71,0,1.71,1.43,0.29,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,8.86,4.29,1.43,0.29,0,0,2,4.57,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,0,0.86,8.57,0,0,8.57,0,0,0.57,0.57,0,0.57,0,0,0,0,0,0.57,0.86,0.29,0,0.57,0,0,0,0,2.86,6.57,0.29,0.29,4.86,1.14,0.29,0,3.14,1.43,5.71,1.71,0,0,0,0,0,14,4.29,1.71,0,0,1.43,6.57

This add-on gathers various features for NVDA debugging and testing.

Features


An enhanced restart dialog to specify some extra options when restarting NVDA.
A toggle script and a backport of NVDA's ""Play a sound for logged errors"" feature.
An object property explorer.
An extended script description mode: when enabled input help mode report information on scripts that have no description.
Commands to help log reading and analyzing.
In the Python console workspace, a function to open the source code of an object.
A command to log the stack trace of the speech.speak function.



Enhanced restart dialog

The NVDA+shift+Q command opens a dialog to specify some extra options before restarting NVDA.
The options that can be specified correspond to the command line options that can be used with nvda.exe, e.g. -c for config path, --disable-addons to disable add-ons, etc.

Play a sound for logged errors

The ""Play a sound for logged errors"" setting has been introduced in NVDA 2021.3 and allows to specify if NVDA will play an error sound in case an error is logged.

This add-on provides an additional command (NVDA+control+alt+E) to toggle this setting.
You can choose:


""Only in test versions"" (default) to make NVDA play error sounds only if the current NVDA version is a test version (alpha, beta or run from source).
""Yes"" to enable error sounds whatever your current NVDA version is.



For NVDA prior to 2021.3, this add-on provides the backport of this feature and the possibility to control it with the keyboard command.
The checkbox in the Advanced settings panel is not backported however.

Object property explorer

This feature allows to report some properties of the current navigator object without opening the log viewer.

To list the properties of an object, move the navigator object to it and use the following commands:


Selects the previous property and reports it for the navigator object.
Selects the next property and reports it for the navigator object.
Reports the currently selected property for the navigator object; two presses displays this information in a browseable message.



These three commands are unassigned by default; you will have to assign them in the Input gesture dialog to use them.

The list of the supported properties is the following:
name, role, state, value, windowClassName, windowControlID, windowHandle, location, Python class, Python class mro.

This feature is an improvement of an example in NVDA developer guide.

Extended script description mode

When the Extended script description mode is active, the input help mode (NVDA+1) is modified as follows.
If a script has no description, the script's name and class are reported.
If a script has a description, its description is reported as usual.
The gesture to activate or deactivate this feature is NVDA+control+alt+D.

Executing a gesture bound to a script without description in input help mode also create an entry for this script in the gesture management dialog.
This entry is located in a dedicated category called ""Scripts without description (modify at your own risk!)"".
This allow to easily add, delete or change the native NVDA gestures for these script.
Be aware however that it is often intended that such script do not have any description to prevent the user to modify the associated gesture.
Indeed, the gesture may be defined to match an application shortcut key.
For example the script script_toggleItalic on NVDAObjects.window.winword.WordDocument is bound to control+I and this should not be modified since the gesture is passed to the application to actually execute the shortcut key.

Usage example

Control+shift+I also toggle italic in Word, even if it is not natively reported by NVDA.
To have the control+shift+I result reported by NVDA as control+I, you should perform the following steps:


Open a Word document.
Enable the extended script description mode with NVDA+control+alt+D.
Enter input help mode with NVDA+1.
Press control+I to report the italic script and have it added in the gesture dialog.
Exit input help mode with NVDA+1.
Open the input gestures dialog.
In the category ""Scripts without description (modify at your own risk!)"", select the command ""toggleItalic on NVDAObjects.window.winword.WordDocument"".
Add the control+shift+I shortcut and validate.
If you want, exit the extended script description mode with NVDA+control+alt+D.



Known bug: A script added for a specific class is visible even if gesture manager is opened in another context.

Log reading and analyzing commands

A log reader mode provides commands to ease log reading and analyzing.
In the log viewer window the log reader is enabled by default, thus log reading commands are available immediately.
In another text reading area such as an editor (e.g. Notepad++) or a webpage (e.g. GitHub issue), you need to press NVDA+control+alt+L to enable log reader mode and use its commands.
When you are done with log reading and analyzing tasks, you can disable again NVDA+control+alt+L to disable the log reader mode.

The commands available in log reader mode are described hereafter.

Quick navigation commands

Single letter command similar to browse mode quick navigation keys allow to move to various type of log messages:
* m: any message
* e: ERROR
* i: IO
* d: DEBUG
* f: INFO
* g: DEBUGWARNING
* w: WARNING

Pressing the single letter moves to the next occurrence of this message. Combining the letter with the shift key moves to the previous occurrence of this message.

Opening a file in your editor

When looking at a traceback, you may want to open one of the source files to understand the cause and the context of the issue.
Press C to open the source code file corresponding to the current line of the traceback.

For this feature to work, you need to have configured your favorite editor's command.
If you are not running NVDA from source, the location of NVDA source code also should have been configured.
For more details regarding the configuration, please see the paragraph NVDA Debug & Test Tools configuration.

Python console extension

In the console, you can call the following function to view the source code that defines the variable myVar:

openCodeFile(myVar)

For this feature to work, you need to have configured your favorite editor's command.
If you are not running NVDA from source, the location of NVDA source code also should have been configured.
For more details regarding the configuration, please see the paragraph NVDA Debug & Test Tools configuration.

The openCodeFile functions can be called on objects defined in NVDA's code or on objects defined by add-ons.
It cannot be called on objects whose source code is not available such as python builtins.

Below are examples of call in NVDA's code:


View the definition of the function speech.speech.speak:

openCodeFile(speech.speech.speak)
View the definition of the class TextInfo:

openCodeFile(textInfos.TextInfo)
View the definition of the method copyToClipboard of the class TextInfo:

openCodeFile(textInfos.TextInfo.copyToClipboard)
View the class definition of the focused object:

openCodeFile(focus)
Open the file api.py defining the module api:

openCodeFile(api)



Log the stack trace of the speech function

Sometimes, you may want to see which part of the code is responsible for speaking something.
For this, you can enable the stack trace logging of the speech function pressing NVDA+control+alt+S.
Each time NVDA speaks, a corresponding stack trace will be logged in the log.

Note: You may modify the script's file directly to patch another function.
See all instructions in the file for details on usage.

NVDA Debug & Test Tools configuration

The log reader commands and the python console extension feature may require a specific configuration.
To use functions that allow to view source code in your editor, you should first configure your editor's command line.
If NVDA's file need to be viewed and if you are not running from source, you also need to configure NVDA's source code path.

Editor's command line configuration

To use the 'open source code' command or the openCodeFile console command, you need first to configure the command that will be called to open the file in your favorite editor.
For this, open the NVDA console (NVDA+control+Z) and type the following line and then Enter:
config.conf['ndtt']['sourceFileOpener'] = r'""C:\path\to\my\editor\editor.exe"" ""{path}"":{line}'
You should of course modify this line according to the real name and location of your editor and the syntax used by it to open files.
{path} will be replaced by the full path of the file to open and {line} by the line number where you want the cursor to be set.
For Notepad++ for example the command to type in the console would be:
config.conf['ndtt']['sourceFileOpener'] = r'""C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe"" ""{path}"" -n{line}'

NVDA source code path configuration

When a file belonging to NVDA's core is listed in the traceback, the line is of the following form:
File ""config\profileUpgrader.pyc"", line 30, in upgrade

If you are not running NVDA from source, you may specify an alternate location where the source file will be found, e.g. the place where you have cloned NVDA source files.
In this case, you have to configure the path where you have NVDA source files located.

For this, open the NVDA console (NVDA+control+Z) and type the following line and then Enter:
config.conf['ndtt']['nvdaSourcePath'] = r'C:\pathExample\GIT\nvda\source'
Of course, replace the path of NVDA source with the correct one.

Be sure however that the version of your source file (e.g. GIT commit) is the same as the one of the running instance of NVDA.

Welcome to the NVDA Community Add-ons website - Speech Logger,"Speech Logger




Author: Luke Davis, with contributions by James Scholes
Download stable version
NVDA compatibility: 2019.3.1 and later



An NVDA add-on to log speech to a file or files.
It can log speech generated on the local machine into a text file.
It can also log speech from a remote machine received through the NVDA Remote add-on, either to the same or a different file.

Configuration

To configure this add-on, open the NVDA menu, go to Preferences, then Settings, then Speech Logger (NVDA+N, P, S, then press S until you get there, on a default U.S. English keyboard).

Note: the add-on can only be configured while in the Normal Configuration profile of NVDA. The add-on is not profile-aware. If you can think of some use case that requires it to operate differently in different profiles, please contact the author or file an issue on the GitHub repo.

The following settings are available:
* The log directory. You can enter or browse for your desired destination directory, which must already exist. System variables such as %temp%, %userprofile%, etc., can be used in this field.
* Local log filename. The created file will be placed in the above directory. This will contain speech logged while the local log mode is engaged. This can be the same as the remote log file. Leave blank to disable this kind of logging completely.
* Remote log filename. The created file will be placed in the above directory. This will contain speech logged while the remote log mode is engaged. It can be the same as the local log file. Leave blank to disable this kind of logging completely.
* Separator. This combobox lets you choose one of the available utterance separators. See below for more information.
* Custom separator. This field lets you enter a custom utterance separator (see below), which is used if ""custom"" is chosen in the combobox.

Utterance separator

When NVDA speaks something such as ""recycle bin  1 of 55"" while it's reading your desktop, this is considered two separate utterances. The first one is the item name (""Recycle bin"", in this example), and the second is the object position information (""1 of 55"", in this example).

Depending on what you are reading, and how you have NVDA configured, there can be several separate utterances that happen during a single speech sequence.

In the normal NVDA log at debug level, each individual utterance is separated with two spaces, as it is written in the example above.

Speech Logger allows you to separate utterances in the same way NVDA does (with two spaces), or by one of a few reasonable alternatives (a newline, a comma and a space, two underscores), or by a custom sequence of your own devising.

If, for example, you wanted your utterance separator to be two dollar signs ($$), you would set the combobox to ""custom"", and enter ""$$"" (without the quotes), in the custom separator field. If you wanted it to be a tab, you could enter ""\t"".

Starting and stopping logging

This add-on has two gestures set by default. You can change them in the NVDA Input Gestures Tools category.
Look for ""Toggles logging of local speech"" and ""Toggles logging of remote speech"".
* NVDA+Alt+L: start/stop logging of local speech.
* NVDA+Shift+Alt+L: start/stop logging of remote speech.

A note on remote speech logging

This add-on is intended to work with the NVDA Remote add-on, for logging of remote speech.

It is important to know, that it is not possible to start logging for remote sessions until you actually start one.
There is no way to, for example, start logging, and have it wait, on stand-by, until a remote session starts, and begin logging at that time.

However, once started, logging will continue across remote sessions.

Feedback and feature requests

If you would like to suggest a feature or report a bug, please reach out by email, or file an issue.

What are NVDA Add-Ons and What Are They Used For? 4 messages,"Hi, I just started with NVDA, and do not understand what the add-ons are for. Can someone please explain it to me. I am using Windows 10.Kenny,

Just in case you may be a former (or even current) JAWS user Add-Ons are analogous to JAWS Scripts.  You can also consider them, in the NVDA screen reader sphere, to be analgous to web browser add-ons/extensions for a given web browser.

NVDA itself, the core code, has certain functions it performs but it, like all screen readers, is not ""all things to all people.""  It offers the ability for third parties to create add-ons that provide functionality that the core code does not.  Every once in a great while something that started out life as an add-on gets integrated into NVDA core code.  One good example of that which is currently ""in the pipeline"" is that the Add-On Updater Add-On functions are supposed to be integrated into NVDA itself at some point in the future.

It is impossible to state briefly what add-ons are for because there are just so many and they do so many different things.  There is no one I know of who has anywhere near to every one of the NVDA add-ons installed and active because they don't need or want a lot of the things certain add-ons do.  It's a ""mix and match"" situation where you pick and choose according to needs you have.


The two primary download Sources for most NVDA Add-Ons (some home-grown ones will appear in neither location) are:
NVDA Community Add-Ons Site
NVDA Add-Ons Directory (hosted by the Spanish-Speaking NVDA Community Association)
Your best bet as far as learning about what they're used for is going to the Community Add-Ons Site as a starting point and looking at the names of the add-ons, and clicking through to look at the more detailed descriptions as well.

When composing email in gmail web how to delete a receiver? 12 messages,"Hello,

When I am composing a new email in gmail web, I add sender by the following ways:

1. after the compose new window is open, nvda focus is on the search field to enter receiver email

2. I enter keywords of the receiver email or name, then I press up or down arrow to look at the suggestion available

3. I press enter to select that particular email as the receiver of the email

4. after pressing enter, nvda will be focused on the empty search field when I can repeat step 2 and 3 to enter extra receivers


After doing the above steps, say I have selected 3 receivers, and later I found that I have to delete some of the receiver email address from the current email.



Can any one instruct me how can I use nvda to remove some of the receivers?

Thank you.When you are in the combo box where you up and down arrow to find
    and add more recipients, instead of moving up and down, move to the
    left or right.  You will move through the addresses you have added. 
    If you haven't moved yet, move left to move through all addresses. 
    Once you are on an address, to remove it, press the delete key.

    

    GeneGene,
    Thank you very much.
    It was strange that in one of the profile of my chrome browser, I
      was able to press left arrow to review selected receiver.
    But in another profile, pressing left arrow, nvda focused onto
      the link to select receiver from contact list.
     

    
    

    
    Gene 於 31/7/2022 18:20 寫道:I'm not sure why.  Make sure that, depending on what your
    screen-reader calls it, you are in forms mode or browse mode is off.

    

    GeneYes, when editing the receiver search field, nvda is in focus
      mode

in the display name field.It's not really all that sluggish. It is very very fast if you know the keystrokes and can memorize those, plus you memorize the layout and know where to find the sections you are looking for. I do use both, and both work well for when Ineedthem.I can breeze through emails since by default every email is group by conversation
I second that.x to select it, # to say, goodbye into the bin.r to reply email, f to forward.believe me, I really read a lot of emails. What can you do if you have multiple email accounts? use email client to download all of them in into the same inbox or browse to different folder to see one by one?All I did was, open different tab in my browser then ctrl - 1 to 9 or ctrl - tab. how easy can it be?I can even google chat to different people in different account, one for work, one for clients etc and friends.



Regards,Thomas N. ChanOh I'm sure, but the big  niggled I have on web delivered mail is that having accounts on different ISPs each and every interface is totally different, whereas all are the same in a client in most respects. I try to keep things simple.

in the display name field.I used to think that you needed a different interface for online
    e-mail with every provider.  I was informed by a knowledgeable
    person, however, that GMail allows you to use GMail for different
    providers.  I don't know how this is done nor what providers you can
    use with the GMail interface.

    

    I don't think any online interface for e-mail is as efficient as an
    e-mail program for blind users but if people want to use online
    interfaces, knowing that GMail offers consolidation may be important
    for some users with different providers.

    

    GeneYou can download emails onto your gmail.like example, if you have an hotmail or yahoo email, you can set it up whereby it will download like pop email onto a label aka folder. more efficient  as compared to an email client.I can  move to different computer and see the same email. I delete one, it will be gone from the rest. since  gmail itself allows you to download mails, you can also delete it or leave it on your mail server. your email client can only work if you have a working computer. if your computer dies or laptop gone, then where is all your emails?
It might be subjective if email client is faster for some but I can move around in gmail faster than on outlook.

Regards,Thomas N. ChanBut most people use IMAP, not POP these days.  If you use a
    different computer, all the mail you have saved on the server or
    that is in the inbox will automatically download to the e-mail
    program on the computer you are using.

    

    As for efficient, while I haven't used on line interfaces much and I
    might alter my opinion if I did, I haven't found any interface that
    is as efficient as an e-mail program where I just move down a list
    of messages and press enter on one I want to read.

    

    In GMail, for example, If I want to read an e-mail without hearing a
    lot of verbiage I don't care about, I have to keep switching between
    having browse mode off and browse mode on.  If I use the browse mode
    off method GMail provides to move from one message to another and
    have it read while leaving browse mode off, there is a lot of
    excessive verbiage that is announced at the beginning of every
    message.

"When updating nvda, do I always need to deactivate / activate the eloquence nvda add on again? 6 messages","As the example the recent RC version of nvda 2022.2

Or any nvda releases for that matter. Except for add on breaking releases obviously.

I wish I knew a Definitive answer for this particular add on. As I use it exclusively for my hearing impairment.   

While I understand the situation where it's obvious to deactivate. Formatting the drive, upgrading internals. Etc. 

Is it Absolutely, necessary, every time, when there's an nvda update or even a: feature update to windows 10 or 11.

For those who use the add on, would love to know your thoughts.

With kind regards

DanielI'm not sure what you are saying. I'd have thought that as the drivers are part of nvda, at least when it updates, it has to do a restart and hence cannot speak.
In the case of windows updates when windows does this it normally runs in a mode where as few bits of windows are running as possible, so it can update system files and then reboots. So are you saying that this loses the paid for voices unless you deactivated them before the update then re enable after it? That would seem a little odd since most registered software seems happy to re initialise as windows reboots.
What are you trying to hear during the update process, as of course Narrator can be set to at least talk some prompts, and maybe finding a different default voice might help, but unless Microsoft are going to do an Apple and put in Eloquence as standard, you are probably stuck with whatever happens here.

in the display name field.Its a question about licensing.  

    

    GeneHi Gene and Brian 
     
    Gene is right, my question is indeed more about
      licensing. 
     
    So basically, within the eloquence and
      vocalizer add on
      compatible release cycle. If I wanted to try out the latest NVDA
      beta, do I
      always need to: one, deactivate the eloquence and vocalizer addon.
     
    Two: update NVDA 
     
    Three: reactivate the eloquence and vocalizer
      addon again. 
     
    If one just updates NVDA but something goes
      Arie during the
      update process, does that mean the user loses one of the three
      activation keys
      that come with the purchased addon product.
     
    Hoping this explanation is now crystal clear! 
     
    With kind regards 
     
    DanielWell, most software I have licenses for checks at boot time of the software.

in the display name field.Of course the only people who can tell you that are the vendors. I suspect that depends on exactly where the update goes wrong. I remember back in the days I used Dolphin screenreaders, they were pretty laid back if this kind of thing happened as were the third parties selling voices  not normally included, and that was years ago.

Whether or not recommending new NVDA user to set Capslock as NVDA key 17 messages,"Hi all,

I would like to ask for your opinion.

Some new NVDA users, including desktop and laptop owners, will ask for my opinion on whether they should set the Capslock as the NVDA key.

With regard to desktop and laptop environment, the logic that I have provided them are as follows:

1. setting Capslock key as NVDA key, you have to press the key two times in order to input capital letters. But if you have to frequently press the Capslock key to type capital letters, then setting Capslock key as NVDA key will not be a good option.

2. setting Capslock key as NVDA key, you have one more option of NVDA key, which you can choose from using the Capslock key or Insert key as the NVDA key. But if you do not set Capslock as NVDA key, you will most probably have to limit to pressing Insert key (laptop) or Insert key or Numpad 0 (desktop).


How would you advice new NVDA users if they own a desktop or laptop regarding this issue? thanks.I use the capslock key even in desktop mode as  for me the keys just make better sence. I don't mind hitting capslock twice, this actually has saved me from oopsies, such as shouthign at people. Lol!Well its prefference.
I mean I like the capslock as modifier key because of its central location.
And I set all my boxes like that but insert on my laptop is not in the
right place and I have got used to it.
Caps lock is always in the same place.
Of course if you need to use caps a lot then maybe not no rule its
user experience.it's up to the user's preference, he will decide if he wants one key or another. the computer is his, so he must know how to choose what is best for him
but anyway I think it would be better to leave all keys enabled, you never know when you will have a problem with these keys

eduardo fermiano luccasjoinville, brasilmúsico e editor de áldio iniciante""HiI always set Caps Lock as an NVDA modifier Because as a touch typist, it is more convenient to have a modifier key on each side of the keyboard to facilitate command entry.   For the same reason, I always get an external keyboard with 2 Windows keys.   I rarely type in all capitals so the double press of the Caps Lock to engage capital input is not an issue as using the shift key is not difficult. Cheers                ChrisSent from Mail for WindowsDoes JAWS have this option? The only reason I ask is because JAWS was
the first screen reader I used, and this was not the modifier.
Therefore, I've found it quite strange to use that key, even though
NVDA has had it as an option ever since I've been using it. It's also
why I wasn't a fan of the revamped Narrator when it came out, because
that was its only modifier. That being said, it's really user
preference as has been stated before.Hmm. I usually tell people to try it both ways. Keep in mind that I'm considering this from the perspective of having key echo turned off and being really aggravated to find out that I've been coding for the last 5 to 10 minutes in upper case. Most programming languages are case sensitive, and depending on the programming style used, it's rare for me to write anything in upper case.


Having Capslock used as a modifier by NVDA makes it much harder for me to accidentally enable it in this particular case.


Hope this is helpful.On Mon, May 23, 2022 at 01:39 PM, Bob Cavanaugh wrote:

I don't know whether JAWS allows the simultaneous use of either Insert (default JAWS key for desktop keyboard layout) and CAPS LOCK (laptop layout) at the same time, but it definitely uses CAPS LOCK as the modifier key for laptop keyboard layout.

I know of very few users, whether of JAWS or NVDA, that use laptop keyboard layout since most laptops that are 15"" or larger have had full keyboards with number pads for quite a while now.

I haven't seen them disappearing except in the netbook space, which is not really a laptop, but an emailing and web browsing machine.  Once you get below 15-inch screens, though, many don't have number pads because there's just no way to fit them in the space available without making the main keyboard ""too small for average human hands.""

Whether a screen reader is involved or not, any business related use of a laptop is going to rely heavily on having a full-sized keyboard with a number pad included.

I've never encountered a 17-inch machine that doesn't have a number pad.

A family member just bought either an otherwise normal (i.e. non-netbook) Acer or Asus 15 incher which doesn't.

And I picked up one, one of the big manufacturers but I forget which, back in 2020 that was a 15"". It showed a numpad on Amazon, but didn't have one when it arrived. It turned out there were multiple versions of the model, and the picture was for a different one than shipped.

I decided that was too much of a grab-bag, returned it, and spent $300 more on an MSI instead. And never looked back.

LukeI do programming as well, many variables and function names include both upper case and lower case.

and many of my passwords used in login in include upper and lower case.

So personally I do not use Capslock as NVDA key.

But for new NVDA users, I will try to explain to them the possible benefits and problems of setting Capslock as NVDA key and let them choose.

But many of them are newly blind people, and they do not have the knowledge to decide on themselves on whether they should set Capslock as NVDA key or not.

This is mainly because I've trained myself to stop relying on the numpad in my daily use - with most laptops not offering it. Now I find it slightly convenient for desktop layout (which, by the way, can still be used for most navigation commands even if laptop mode is selected in NVDA's keyboard settings), but often times, even when it is available, I find myself reverting to alternative commands from muscle memory.
It's all personal preference - I personally am very adaptable teaching students but I also feel like it's important to offer any alternative available. The numpad insert key may not be there on a laptop, or like me, they may grow to feel more comfortable using capslock as a modifier key, so I think it's important to not only demonstrate desktop commands but laptop as well. I know far too many who rely on the numpad due to how they were initially taught - and at this point, I'm far more proficient using the top number row for data entry than I ever was using the number pad, so perhaps I'm biased.",1519,62,0.040816327,0.040816327,1,1515,36.85,4.08,82.03,33.1,22.95,15.18,84.16,68.25,53.99,12.41,7.52,4.62,0,1.06,0.53,1.25,4.88,12.34,6.01,4.42,12.01,9.77,5.74,8.25,2.84,17.36,7.39,4.95,1.58,0.13,0.4,1.06,19.54,1.32,17.89,5.15,3.04,1.65,3.1,0.53,6.93,0.33,2.51,1.72,0.79,0.46,0.4,0.07,0,0.07,0,0,5.87,2.44,0.2,0.26,0,0.13,1.12,3.43,0,0.07,0,0.59,2.77,0,0,2.77,3.43,0.07,0.26,2.9,0.2,0.07,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.53,0.2,0.4,1.39,0.13,0,0.07,0.07,0.2,3.96,5.87,0.13,0.59,4.03,0.59,0.07,0.33,4.03,4.62,5.21,1.39,0.33,0.26,0.07,0.07,0,17.82,5.54,5.08,0.33,0.13,2.51,4.22

For very basic reading, writing, and forwarding, it works well enough.

Some of its folder actions, selection options, etc., are not so very accessible.

Better to use Thunderbird or Outlook if you can.

Well i entered windows mail in the windows search field and it opened but i didn't even manage to set up an account. To me with NVDA it looked like a bluescreen.


Is there a not so expensive way to use outlook? I mean, the pricing is kind of high, because you can only seem to purchase outlook with extras, that i don't need. Is there something like a plane outlook?

FITA Gattard House, National Road, Blata l-Bajda, HMR9010, MaltaWhat problems are you having?  If you are referring to the Mail app,
    for use with Windows 10 and 11, it is usable, but I think it is a
    bad idea to use it and I would strongly recommend Thunderbird
    instead.

    

    I tried using it with GMail and, though deleting messages in the app
    means they no longer show in the app, they are still left on the
    server.  Over time, you would have an enormous number of messages
    left in GMail, I believe still in the inbox.  Wherever they are,
    they are just taking up space.

    

    Since I only tried the program with GMail, I don't know what might
    happen with other servers but I wouldn't want to take the chance.

    

    If you still want to try the app, let us know what problems you are
    having and we can discuss them.  For example, f9 is the command to
    download messages.

I can not say why, but i am not 100 percent satisfied with Thunderbird. It is just a feeling. No logical reasons.

    the program wasn't as accessible as it has become in the last few
    years.  There is a Thunderbird add-on that allows you to use first
    letter navigation in the folder's tree view.  There is an NVDA
    add-on that allows you to change the order in which headers are
    shown and which ones are.

    

    Many commands are what you would use in standard Windows e-mail
    programs, control r to reply, control n for new, for example, and
    autocomplete for addresses works well.

    

    In short, if you don't know why you didn't like it, I would hope
    that you try it again.  

    

    I don't like to see people pay for an e-mail program unless they
    have needs that go beyond the typical users.  

    

    I've used Outlook Express, Windows Live Mail, and Thunderbird.  I
    liked Outlook Express the most from an accessibility standpoint, but
    with the improvements in Thunderbird accessibility, I consider both
    programs to be about equal now.

    

    GeneI should add that Thunderbird has a portable version and that is the
    version I use.  I use it because I can keep a backup and, if
    anything goes wrong with the program, I don't have to troubleshoot
    or reinstall.  All I have to do is to remove the Thunderbird folder
    and copy the backup folder to the original location.  

    

    And If I get a new computer, I don't have to install it.  All I have
    to do is to copy the Thunderbird folder from my old computer or from
    a backup on an external drive to the new computer.  I know you can
    install Thunderbird and then transfer your profile to the new
    installation and that may easily accomplish the same thing but it is
    still faster and easier to just copy the program.  And the program
    may become corrupt, though unlikely, and require reinstallation.  As
    I said, with the portable version, you just delete a folder and copy
    the backup folder.

    

    As I said, the portable version has advantages I think are worth
    considering.

    

    GeneFor those using the installed Thunderbird, here is an article about
    how to transfer your profile.  The article doesn't say this, but I
    think the profile should be backed up as you would any information
    you don't want to lose.

https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-move-your-thunderbird-profile-email-to-a-new-windows-computer/

    

    While the procedure as written isn't difficult, it is still faster
    and easier to copy the portable folder and also not spend time
    installing the program first.  

    

    The information in this article looks reliable but I don't have
    other knowledge of it.  Others may want to comment.

    

    GeneMy only problem with Windows Mail is that there is not a deleted items folder. Sent from Mail for WindowsDeleted Items in Windows 10 mail go into the Trash folder. Cheers                Chris Sent from Mail for WindowsHi all.

      you for the hint with the portable version of Thunderbird. I
      should give it another chance. I was just used to using windows
      things and so i was thinking, that it is still good. Microsofts
      seems to send all of thair products down hill. *grins*
    But this is off topic. :-)
    

    
    Thank you again. You all helped me a lot.
    

    
    Regards
    Daniel

That may help with this and it won't hurt anything to try.

Then restart the machine and try with mail again.

Oh, and you shouldn't need to type ""windows mail"", just ""mail"".

Lastly: I agree with the others--use something else if you can. But still try the above tool, because if it would have fixed anything, it means other things are probably not as accessible as they could be.

LukeHi


Not sure if you are aware there is a tutorial for the windows mail program on my website. The following link will put you on the page where it is at http://accessibilitycentral.net/nvda%20tutorials%20for%20other%20programs.html

When you get to it jump down by headings  until you hear the one for the windows mail app.



I also have one for mozilla thunder bird at

http://accessibilitycentral.net/accessible%20email%20client%20mozilla%20thunderbird.html

Any of the nvda tutorials can be gotten to from any of there pages unlike the blindness related stuff.

Hope it helps.


Gene nz, I use windows mail on here with my gmail account.  It’s not a problem. I do from time to time check mail on the gmail site so it’s not kept on the server.  I tried installing thunderbird on my system and I could not put gmail on it. Sent from Mail for WindowsYes there is!  You have to go into follders. Then arrow to deleted.  Sent from Mail for WindowsI don't know what problem you had.  Thunderbird has a good utility
    for automatically finding information needed to create accounts if
    you furnish usernames and passwords.  

    

    I don't know how many people  have the problem of messages being
    left to pile up on servers, but its something people who use the
    program should be aware of and check when they first start using it.

    

    Since I have the problem, others should check when they first start
    using the program to see if they do.  I can't generalize from my
    experience and I may have written as though I was.  But what I meant
    to say is that since I have this behavior, people should check.

Arlene,

I can't, and won't, argue about your personal experience.  But I will say, from vast personal and professional experience, that Thunderbird and Gmail play perfectly well together in every instance where I've set the two up with each other.

No modern email client which remains in support, of which Thunderbird is but one, can afford to be either completely incompatible with or difficult to configure with Google Mail.

As a general statement, there is no issue between Thunderbird and Gmail.  It handles the whole OAUTH setup process in a manner very similar to the way Outlook does.  And, of course, Thunderbird is probably the most reliably accessible full-featured email client other than Outlook.

WordPress website creation 3 messages,"What is the best interface for a blind person to create a WordPress website?
ThanksAngelo, you can do it via your browser of choice or via the WordPress
app. My only experience w/the latter is thru the App store, though I
suspect it's equally accessible via Android/Google Play.

My recommendation is that for now you use the classic editor rather
than the block editor. Accessibility in the latter has improved
markedly. but, IMO, is still a bit awkward. I happen to be a huge fan
of Markdown, for hwich you can use Jetpack or a Gutenberg markdown
block. But this is beginning to stray from NVDA. Perhaps check my
signature for a resource that might interest you.

Wordpad Shortcut to Desktop 15 messages,"Hi Group,

I have been trying to create desktop shortcut for Wordpad with no success.

Facebook: m.facebook.com/LiteraryBrailleProofreaderThe easiest way around this issue, and that works for ""the long term"" regardless of what applications you might install, is to create the All Applications Folder on your desktop, and then create an actual desktop shortcut for whatever app or apps you wish out of it.  Just leave it on the desktop afterward for later use.

See my tutorial: Using the Microsoft Special Applications Folder for Creating Desktop Shortcuts (docx format)

The first section covers creating the All Applications folder on your desktop, which you need only do once if you do not delete it, and the second discusses using it to snag specific applications and get their shortcuts on your desktop.

I will have to check under Windows 11 and report back.  I would be surprised if something this ""fundamental and unchanged"" for a very long time had changed, but nothing is impossible.  Someone else may beat me to it.

I have no idea what might be happening on your end, but I can confirm on mine, using Windows 11 Home Version 21H2, Build 22000.434, following the instructions in, Using the Microsoft Special Applications Folder for Creating Desktop Shortcuts, from end to end works as documented, with no silences or dialogs failing to pop up.

         ~ Vance PackardNevzat,

Is the computer you're trying to do this on yours, and where you are using an account with admin privileges when you're trying to do it?

My only theory, and that's all it is, for why the New Shortcut option would not work from the Context Menu is if you do not have the necessary permissions to add one.  If it's a work computer, or you're using a standard account except when you do admin-focused tasks, that's a possible factor.

Facebook: m.facebook.com/LiteraryBrailleProofreader""Certain commands are implicitly designed Not To Show a dialog box.
But I've heard from countless people saying that ""Every command needs a dialog box""!
No, that's totally counter-intuitive to Windows/other graphical interfaces.
Create Shortcut is one of those.
It's also assumed the shortcut will go in the location where the item is found at;
hence why dragging this shortcut/pinning it to the taskbar/start screen/3rd-party start menu helps out here.

If you need further coaching as to why this is the case,
tap on the Reply to Sender option so I don't clutter this thread,
(Which really should've gone on WinAccess)?
Jason BratcherCheck your desktop. It should be there. I get a thing that says ""can't create a shortcut here.. It then asks if I want to create it on the desktop, I say yes, then say yes, or would if I had UAC on. Are you not getting any of those dialogues? Can you record what happens when you try and do this and upload it to WeTransfer or dropbox?I would suggest that those who wish to use the instructions I have given earlier read them through, in their entirety, before commencing.  Twice if something's not clear.

I state that a dialog box (series, actually) appears in one, and only one, instance and that is when you are creating the desktop shortcut for the All Applications folder.  As Sarah Alawami noted earlier, that's not strictly necessary, I just do it because I like having the All Applications folder around for ""the next time I need/want it.""  Her option for hitting the Windows Key + R to open the Run Dialog, and pasting in (sans quotes) ""shell:Appsfolder"" then hitting Enter will bring up that same folder for immediate use, but once you close it it's gone.

The ""Create Shortcut"" command does not bring up a dialog box but a warning that the shortcut can't be created here (in the Appsfolder) and asking if you'd like for it to be placed on the desktop instead.  Here's the text from the instructions, verbatim:
3. Bring up the context menu for that icon, and use the Create Shortcut option.
 4. You will then get a warning saying the icon cannot be created here, but it can be placed on the desktop, and asking if you want to put it there.  You will, of course, answer Yes.

I could not possibly be more precise about exactly what occurs at each and every step, and the instructions themselves, when originally created, were done by actually recording events as each command was issued and what it's after effects entailed.

The best way to determine how these options should be set for your use
cases would be to read their description in the user guide. I personally
prefer to work with all options in the review settings panel except
""Simple review mode"" unchecked, but that is of course pretty subjective,
and requires moving review cursor manually to the focus position rather
than this being done automatically.

Regards
LukaszAs Lukasz said,
The best suggestion is to be aware of what the options do and how the review cursor works, and then you will work out the best set of options for you.
Here is the User Guide section on navigating, which includes the review cursor: https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html#NavigatingWithNVDA
Here is the section on the review cursor settings: https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html#ReviewCursorSettings
Now, if you aren't familiar with the review cursor, or how it works, I would strongly suggest that the Basic Training for NVDA guide, although not free, is worth it for the sections on the Review Cursor and Object Navigation alone: https://www.nvaccess.org/product/basic-training-for-nvda-ebook/
Basically though, those three options will set whether the review cursor follows:
System Focus: This includes things like the current ribbon option when navigating the ribbon in Word or File Manager, the current menu item in the start menu, the button or checkbox on a web page, the options in the NVDA settings dialog etc. 
System Caret: The text cursor anytime you are somewhere editing text such as an email, Word document or web form.  (In this way, you can think of the System Focus as whatever NVDA is currently on any time you are NOT in an edit field).

Mouse cursor: This will follow the mouse around - this is mostly useful (but possibly very much so) if you have some sight and use the mouse.

Twitter: @NVAccess""Explanation of those settings, from documentation:

12.1.11. Review Cursor
The Review Cursor category in the NVDA Settings dialog is used to configure NVDA's review cursor behaviour. This category contains the following options:
Follow System Focus
Key: NVDA+7
When enabled, The review cursor will always be placed in the same object as the current system focus whenever the focus changes.


Follow System Caret
Key: NVDA+6
When enabled, the review cursor will automatically be moved to the position of the System caret each time it moves.


Follow mouse cursor
When enabled, the review cursor will follow the mouse as it moves.


Simple Review mode
When enabled, NVDA will filter the hierarchy of objects that can be navigated to exclude objects that aren't of interest to the user; e.g. invisible objects and objects used only for layout purposes.
To toggle simple review mode from anywhere, please assign a custom gesture using the Input Gestures dialog.


In other words, up to you, and might also depend on context?

""Resistance is futile...but, acceptance is versatile...""I haven't looked into what most of the settings do in this category,
    though I have seen a little discussion and read a bit at some
    point.  Unless you experiment or know some reason why you would
    benefit from a settings change, I generally leave defaults as they
    are.  In this case, the defaults are as follows:

    Follow system focus, checked.

    Follow system caret, checked.

    Follow mouse cursor, unchecked and 

    simple review mode, checked.

    

    GeneI think that for most users, that is a bad way to set things up. 
    That means that when you want to use screen review for some reason,
    it will never be where you are in terms of where you have been
    working.  If a dialog opens, you won't be in that dialog in screen
    review.  It is usually a better choice to have screen  review be
    where you are so you can use it if you want to and not have to move
    to where you are first.  There is a command to move to where the
    system focus is, but why have things set to have to issue that
    command as a general practice when most of the time, you want screen
    review to be where you are working?  The one exception I can think
    of where you might want to change the setting is if you want to be
    able to read something that changes over time, such as a number
    measuring how far along a download is, and you want to be working
    somewhere else and have the review cursor stay where it is.

accessibility at disney plus 2 messages,"Hi,
 
Some of you told me that’s many things on Disney plus are accessible.

 
So, unfortentally, it’s not so accessible and the customer service dept. didn’t know what I want from them when I’m saying for example: the sound of music is not come with audio description. They said, its not there responsibility.

They even asked me if I mean the dabbing.
 
Any help to sole the AD problem and the misunderstand of Disney plus, will be really great.
 
Thanks,
 
AfikHi Afik
    

    
    The last time I used Disney plus on the phone it was very
      accessible.
    

    
    Disney plus on the web was very accessible and also the app on my
      samsung tv.
    

    
    Not all shows are audio described on disney plus.
    

    
    You also need to find a show depending how you go in say that is
      audio described  and start playing it. At that time it will play
      as normal with out audio description.
    

    
    You need then to go into the player and I think it was under the
      audio section change it from english to english audio description
      then you will hear it.
    

    
    I did do a tutorial on how to do it with nvda on the website
      using nvda that can be found at http://accessibilitycentral.net/nvda%20tutorials%20for%20other%20programs.html
    When you get to that page locate the heading for disney plus and
      under it is a link to the tutorial on what to do.
    

    
    It should be a simular idea if you use the screen reader on a
      phone to turn it on.
    

    
    After it is on no matter what device you access it with if the
      show has audio description on it you will be good to go.
    

    
    The next link will take you to the shows that are audio described
      at https://adp.acb.org/disneyad.html
    It may vary country to country but quite a few i TRIED in New
      Zealand played with audio description.
    

    
    Hope it helps.

Dan Beaver (KA4DAN)The general consensus, based on what I've read, is that LibreOffice is accessible, but not as consistently so as Microsoft Office is, which really isn't surprising since the screen reader makers focus on Microsoft Office because of its near ubiquity in the business world.

I can't speak to add-ons for NVDA that may target LibreOffice.

There is a dedicated Libre Office Accessibility Discussion List, but it is not hugely active.

You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.
     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedHi! LO is *mostly* accessible.  Presently, work is underway at both LO and NVDA to make it more so.  Make sure that you are always running the latest versions of LO and NVDA since these accessibility improvements are rolling out progressively.  Make sure that you have installed and are always running the Java Access Bridge.  There are a bunch of help files for keyboard shortcut keys for LO “Calc,” “Writer” and so on available.  Following are a couple of specific things: 1.            In all applications (Writer, Calc, etc.), under the “View” menu uncheck the option to show the “Sidebar.”  The Sidebar is an alternative way of navigating around the active document.  It is not necessary.  When pressing F6 to cycle through the menu bar, tool bars and the active document itself, the Sidebar will therefore be removed from that cycle. 2.            In Writer, it helps to go to View>User Interface and check the radio button labeled ""Contextual Single."" HTH,RichardRichard B. McDonald wrote:

Make sure that you have installed and are always running the Java Access Bridge.Do you still find that necessary? NVDA has included JAVA Access Bridge for about two and a half years now. My understanding is that you shouldn't need to take any action. If you do, perhaps a bug report is in order.

From the 2019.3 changelog:

- The Java Access Bridge is now included with NVDA to enable access to Java applications, including for 64 bit Java VMs. (#7724)
- If the Java Access Bridge is not enabled for the user, NVDA automatically enables it at NVDA startup. (#7952)

LukeThank you Richard, your suggestions improved my using of Libre Office.

Gabe.Hi Gabe!

I am glad to help.  Incidentally, I have read that having only one toolbar showing also improves accessibility.  In LO (e.g., Calc, Writer, etc.), the default is to have like three toolbars showing.  There is an option to have only one show; which such one can be chosen.  I have not tested this, but it sure makes sense.  Basically, as with the sidebar, it lessens the clutter onscreen and reduces the number of toggles needed to move through the active sections of the screen via F6.  Might you try this out and let us know how it goes?

Bye,
RichardHi Luke!

I did not know this.  I stand corrected.  Thanks for letting me know of
this!

Bye,
RichardBesides, I think it's only the database component of Libre that requires
Java Runtime.Hello,

and what about say all function in LO? what should I do that this function would work as expected and will read text until end of a document, not only of the end of a current page in Writer?

thanks.

It is, but since synthesizers are so closely related to any given screen reader, the following is in the group description:  ""Discussions about which programs are accessible using NVDA, NVDA add-ons, NVDA tutorials and documentation, and configuring synthesizers or Braille displays for use with NVDA are also permitted.""

Personally, I think this is a job for Harpo Tech Support and they should be the first point of contact.  A report back on what is actually involved would be appreciated.

         ~ Vance PackardForgive me for asking what may be an obvious question but did they not send you any instructions via email? In most cases companies that sell software, particularly specialized software, send a follow-up email with some sort of activation
 instructions. I’ve never dealt with Harpo but after looking at their Web site I was tempted to consider them as they may be one of the few sources available for SAPI-compatible Nuance voices.

    For remote support:
    https://nvdaremote.comWell I have searched for and doodledwith  tienda which appears to
      be a spanish addon store.
    It works and there are official and a few nonofficial addons
      there.
    The store is completely developed and looks really good but for
      security sake vetted addons are probably the best though as we
      branch there will need to be some more trusted sources.
    Of course bits of it are not in english and the nvda.es site is
      not english either.
    Even the store is not completely in english so there is that.
    However I do wander if instead of getting into our own store
      unless we want to do this we should include other sources which
      are established.
    I just for example updated tony's enhancements but thats not been
      released in updater yet.Hi, good morning.

      

      About the Add-ons Store that we have in the Hispanic community, I
      have to say that it is not in English because it is not my native
      language and because it was left with the translations of the
      first versions. Currently it has 80 of the 141 strings translated
      and nobody translated the documentation.

      

      The Russian, Turkish, French and Italian community for example are
      more advanced in terms of translations of the Store.

      

      Well on security issues on the page www.nvda.es the add-ons that
      are published pass a security filter examined by developers,
      especially concerning malicious code. Fortunately, no cases have
      been detected to date.

      

      On this page there is a manifesto on the subject and the review
      that the add-ons pass.

      

      There are plugins that no longer serve but are still maintained as
      a catalog and especially to save code that in the future someone
      could serve as a query for various reasons.

      

      I take advantage if someone wants to translate the store that the
      pot file is on Github:

      

https://github.com/hxebolax/Tienda-para-NVDA/releases/download/0.8.3/TiendaNVDA.pot

      

      The store is prepared to support add-on repositories from other
      sources as long as they are based on this project developed by the
      Hispanic community to catalog add-ons:

      

      https://github.com/nvda-es/advancedAddonFiles

      

      In the previous link is all the information. Also say that both
      www.nvda.es and https://nvda-addons.org have a translation widget

addOn Updater 2.8 and checking both International and Spanish-only NVDA? 8 messages,"Joseph: Awesome work on making better and better the AddOn updater! But have several questions:
1.-can one set up the updater to check. Both, the Spanish NVDA and ther International NVDA site? I went into NVDA settings/AddOn Updater, and you can only check one of the other apparently, right? Thus if this isn’t possible as of now,
2.-so would you recommend I maintain the “Tienda” AddOn? Because that one checks updates from the Latinamerica NVDA site.

Regarding the first question, ideally, yes but hard to do in practical terms. When opening websites, because sites are hosted around the world, it may take a while for some sites to load. For computers, the slowest component (usually memory, disk, and other hardware) contributes to overall performance. While it doesn't take long to gather add-on update metadata from both sites, there are times when Add-on Updater must locate the actual download ink for an add-on update, which is why it takes up to several seconds for the add-on to check for updates. This is for one site, now imagine doing this for multiple websites, and in this scenario, the site that is slowest to respond takes up significant portion of update check progress. Also, remember that different update sources may say different things about an add-on - some may give conflicting compatibility information for an add-on update, while another site may offer an older version of a compatible add-on. For these reasons, I decided to at least offer users a setting to configure update sources.

As for the second question, I advise keeping Tienda (see a reply from Jose-Manuel). This is why I intentionally told Add-on Updater (via add-on source code) to not check for updates for Tienda as that add-on is essentially the add-on store for the Spanish community. In an earlier Twitter thread, I assured Jose-Manuel that Add-on Updater is a client, not a full store like Tienda is, knowing that many of you from Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries rely on Tienda to meet their add-on needs. Same can be said about the French community and other language communities with their own dedicated add-ons repositories (I once thought about talking to French community about letting Add-on Updater check for updates from their repository; my personal rule is that I must obtain consent from communities before I can ask Add-on Updater to check for updates from new repos in future add-on releases; I'm indeed open to this proposal and would love to talk to French community members about it in the fall as it takes about a day or two to add new add-on repositories).

Cheers,

JosephHi Joseph
    

    
    In the latest release of the add on updater in the other version
      of it it let me go between the 2 websites to get addons but
      noticed when it updated that option is not there any more.
    I think that one ended with a 7 and the one I just got ends in a
      8 here the option has gone.
    

    
    The second question was under the settings for the add on updater
      where it gave 2 options was there a gesture to toogle between the
      2 sites instead of going into the settings each time I could not
      find one so guess there was not.
    

    
    The update of the add on I just did just then you gave there is
      no option now for the 2 sites.
    

    
    Gene nzHi,

Add-on update source option was added in 22.08. Also, note that some Add-on Updater settings panel options are unavailable unless you are using Windows 10 and NVDA is actually installed, particularly update notification combo box.

Cheers,

JosephHi Joseph
    

    
    It looked when I updated to the latest add on with a 8 on it it
      went back to the previous version. I since then uninstalled the
      add on updater with the 7 which should of been 8 then reinstalled
      the latest and the options have came back.
    

    
    All is good I see both sites but would be curious about the
      second question where or if you could toggle between the 2 sites
      with a gesture but did not find one so then it was not a option.
    

    
    Could this be a option in a future release?
    

    
    Gene nzHi,

Toggling update sources with a dedicated command: no. When you switch update sources, you are effectively telling NVDA (via Add-on Updater) to get add-on update metadata from a different website, which may or may not have all add-ons you've got and/or offer different versions and/or report different compatibility statements. This is why you'l get a confirmation message after switching to a different update source from Add-on Updater settings.

Cheers,

JosephWell you would hardly need windows essentials if you were as I am using windows 7, would you?

addons for nvda 2022.1 5 messages,"Hi.

Easy table navigator is among the addons incompatible is this a discontinued thing?

also what is the status of doug's addons likee skype and teamtalk classic?

Extended winamp is also in that lot.

For EasyTableNavigator, Corentin had taken over the maintenance a few month ago. He had submitted a 2022.1 compatible version but has hold off on its distribution due to bugs in Word with UIA. He should be investigating but I have no news.
Please comment on the GitHub's repo if needed. Maybe it would be worth distributing the bugged version at least to deal with tables on webpages.

alphanumeric strings as phonetics? 16 messages,"Would anyone else like to see NVDA be able to pronounce alphanumeric strings using the phonetic alphabet?This would be useful for Canadian and British postal codes, ham radio call signs, and probably other things as well. L9G3S6 would be Lima 9 Golf 3 Siera 6. Is that something I should post to Github about? Jaws can do this by the way.Isn't this already handled by the following add-on?:

The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.
        ~ Dorothy NevillNot exactly, or at least not how I’m able to read things with the other screen reader.With this add-on, I move character by character, and hear the phonetics for each character after I hear the letter name, and after an adjustable pause. In Jaws, if I turn on “Spell Alphanumeric Data”, I have the following options:Off, which is the default setting, reads the text as it appears. For example, the license plate number 123RON is read as one hundred twenty-three Ron. The Spell option spells alphanumeric data. For example, 123RON is read as 1 2 3 R O N. Spell Phonetically uses the phonetic alphabet to spell alphanumeric data. For example, JAWS reads 123RON as 1 2 3 Romeo Oscar November. It’s that third behavior which I would love to have in NVDA. ChrisChris,

The way I read the following in the documentation, ""Read the character description instead of the current character. This feature must be enabled or disabled manually and will be deactivated when NVDA is closed,"" suggested to me that what you wanted is able to be turned on, but only on a ""per NVDA session"" basis.

Have you played with that option?

        ~ Dorothy NevillHi Brian.I couldn’t find that option when I went into NVDA> Preferences > Settings > Enhanced Phonetic Reading.I see two options: A checkbox that says “enable delayed descriptions for characters”, and a slider to adjust how many milliseconds gap there is between the letter and the phonetic.Maybe I’m missing something somewhere else though. I’m talking about the ability to hear a string phonetically.I know what he means. The ham calls sign  or something, similar to the settings on the bNS. I personally would not go for it, why not create a poll on straw poll and see where that gets you. Then you can decide if you want to create a suggestion on github.On Sat, Jul 2, 2022 at 12:39 PM, Sarah k Alawami wrote:

As do I.

Here's more from the documentation if you use the Add-On Help feature in Add-Ons Manager:
----

Usage
The add-on functionality will be enabled once you install it.
To enable or disable it, go to NVDA settings and select ""Enhanced phonetic reading"". In that category you can set the following parameters:

Enable delayed descriptions for characters.
Delay to announce character descriptions (in ms): the time the add-on waits to speak the description for the read character. You can't set it greater than 20000 ms.

Scripts

toggle instant character descriptions: Assigned to ""nvda + control + numpad2"" or ""nvda+ control + enter"" for laptop keyboards. This script enables or disables the instant character descriptions feature.
toggle delayed descriptions: no gestures assigned. This script lets you toggle the delayed descriptions status.

You can assign a command or gesture in speech category in the NVDA input gestures dialog.
----
 
It appears to me that you can get instant phonetic reading, and only phonetic reading, either by unchecking the checkbox for delayed descriptions or using the toggle keyboard command to turn it off.

I understand why many would not want to hear the letter first followed by its phonetic equivalent.  I'm actually surprised that this add-on is not set up with defaults that are the reverse of what they are, but it's configurable.

I used the dev version since I do have NVDA 2022 installed.

        ~ Dorothy NevillI'm curious about the JAWS feature.  Can you set the speed at which
    letters are announced and whether and how long ;pauses are between
    the announcement of individual letters?  I would think that if that
    weren't done, the letters might be announced so quickly you would
    lose track of them if you use a somewhat fast speech rate.

    

    GeneI don’t find it hard to understand, and I listen to Eloquence at about 70%.With the feature turned on and set to phonetics, it says each word as if there is a comma after it. So, for example, L9G3S6 will be read as “Lima, 9, golf, 3, Sierra, 6”.That's what I had in mind, the pause would be important, I think.

So, if I'm understanding you correctly, you want NVDA to detect that it has an unpronounceable alphanumeric string when it's doing a say all and, when such is encountered, say it phonetically?

It's not that something like this couldn't be done, but it does require quite a bit of overhead as each ""word"" would need to be analyzed as to whether it was an alphanumeric string in realtime, which is a non-trivial and resource intensive task (relatively speaking) since there is no way to predict where such might occur in a text.  Does the JAWS feature do this during a Say All?

And I did just play with the Enhanced Phonetic Reading add-on and if I use the NVDA + CTRL + NumPad 2 command I can toggle instant reading of each character phonetically and have it skip the regular announcement of the letter itself.  So, provided I'm going letter by letter, I get “Lima, 9, golf, 3, Sierra, 6” for L9G3S6.

Yep, I just tried it.Yep I listen to nvda at close to 100, or at least I’m retraining my ear. And for me I don’t really find alpha bravo etc hard.Hi Group,

    

    A simple way of describing this is indeed to have 'spell
    alpha-numeric expressions phonetically' active during screen reader
    'say all' reading.  Here's an example.  

    

    Say I have the following sentence in 'say all.' mode.

    I just had a conversation with Robert smith WA2PDQ on the forty
    meter ham band.  

    With 'spell alpha-numeric expression phonetically' turned on in
    JAWS, this sentence would be rendered in 'say all' mode as follows:

    I just had a conversation with Robert smith Whiskey Alpha 2 Papa
    Delta Quebec on the forty meter ham band.  

    

    This would be a nice feature if it could be implemented in NVDA.

Have any of you noticed  normal navigation doesn't apply to the Audible search box?  They have made a change where the combo box editable cannot be navigated to by c or e/f. You have to use tab, and browse mode won't work.  However it is possible to type into it.Hi Enes,

I use the Canadian website at;

For the last week or more, when I go to the home  page and press ""e"" to be in the search edeit box, nvda tells me there is no edit field.
Tabbingdoes not help.  Bringing up the list of elements does not help.
I told the audible help about this.
So, instead, I go to the advanced search and  work from there.
A few extra keystrokes, but at least I get to search.Hello,

I am seeing the same behavior and tabbing also does not help.

Thanks.
Dave.OK,  I know this is off topic, but I will make  two comments and say no more.
First, this is not  a nvda problem,  I get the same results with jaws.

Second.  I created a shortcut that takes me to the ""advanced search"" in audible and this solved the problem.

If you load the main audible page and then move to the button that says: 'submit search,' then switch to edit mode with NVDA key + space bar and then shift + tab once, you are placed in the search field. There is a lot of extraneous chatter when you do this, but if you do this, you can type in the search terms and then tab to the submit search button, press space bar and obtain the search results.

can't read items in folder 9 messages,"Running latest releases of Win 10 and NVDA.
On a random basis I can open a folder such as my documents or downloads and it appears on the screen to be normal.  However I can not read the files and folders by either using first letter or up and down arrows.  I try closing the folder and open it again with same results.  So far the only way I have found to solve the problem is to close and restart NVDA.On some instances I have to close and restart NVDA more than once to resolve the problem.  Is there a better way to handle this problem when it happens?
ThanksI have had similar experiences with things like the Windows Update windowUsually when it first opens it says the last time it was updatedHowever, it is not accessible to the mouse or arrow keysThen if I use the tab key it seems to put it into focus and the window becomes accessible
I have also had to get used to something similar while editing email messages.However, I don't know what triggers the problem...Sometimes it is like the message edit box goes out of focus 
Then the arrow keys stop speaking the text being editedIf I force the focus to somewhere else like the subject field and come back to the edit box it works  properly again
I have only been having these problems in more recent versions of NVDA.This probably started about a year or so ago...
RussAgree.The Windows update settings window is some what bothering with the latest versions. I am afraid whether this has been caused by NVDA or the Windows itself.The recent update window does not leave the NVDA focus stable, the list of updates keeps moving away from the focus automatically.Some times it is difficult to see the list of update items and their progress level cannot be read with NVDA.The focus moves to the Pause button instead of the list.So Tab and Shift+Tab several times would help to some what find the required details.It would be more helpful if we can have a standard way with NVDA in these windows. Thanks,Ravi. V.S.Ravindran.Excuses leads to failure!””I don't think this is new. I've seen the files not being read and reading update history going back to Win 7. As for whether its more likely with newer nvda versions, well maybe it has been. Alt tab and alt tab back sometimes works, but at other times you seem to get into views that say a B C etcc. I have a sneaking suspicion it may be certain choices of details or how files are displayed that makes it worse though. It needs somebody with patience to work logically though only alting one thing at a time to solve these sort of problems.
There is also an allied issue where alt tab if alte it is held down and multiple programs are running you suddenly find you can only get to 2 of the running programs, and have to click on the program  itself to start things working again.

Windows Update screen: caused by UIA events, more so when the screen updates things. This is more pronounced on Windows 11 21H2 (original release; I know, this will get complicated for a whiel), resolved in upcoming Windows 11 22H2 (for this reason, I stronlgy recommend anyone running Windows 10 and 11 to tell us exactlu which release they are using so people will not get confused).

And I thank you for pointing out, and very clearly, that there are times when something is Windows-based, and under which specific Windows versions those issues occur.

This also points out why, in the age of Windows As A Service, that keeping up-to-date is important.  Things identified as issues do get fixed, but that fix comes in the form of an update, very often a Feature Update.

I really would encourage those interested in having the information about Windows (and/or NVDA and/or anything else they think pertinent) as a part of every message they post to Groups.io to look into the Signature feature on your personal Groups.io Subscription page.  You can choose to have that signature attached when posting from the web, posting using email, or both.  I've been including my Windows information for years now after my name in my signature, so that exact version and build information is available when it's needed.  I don't do the same for NVDA because the versions change more frequently and 6-8 characters is not terribly difficult to type when that information needs to be shared.

this is a NvDA issue as closing and restarting NVDA seems to resolve the

Yes, but several someones have introduced what they believe to be related issues.  It's perfectly OK for anyone to respond regarding those issues when they know something about them, but not necessarily the one you originally identified.

But you also need to realize that yours is the very first report of this particular issue that I can recall on the NVDA Group.  That really does suggest that this issue is limited, if not strictly to you then to a very small subset of NVDA users.

Whenever any suspected NVDA-related issue is encountered, the first thing to do is:  The Most Basic Troubleshooting Steps for Suspected NVDA Issues
 

If the issue seems possibly related to Windows (and this one is clearly in that class) it never hurts, after having tried those basic troubleshooting steps, to do the following:

1. Using DISM (Deployment Imaging Servicing and Management) and SFC (System File Checker) to Repair Windows 8.1, 10 & 11
2. Performing a Windows 10 or 11 Repair Install or Feature Update Using the Windows ISO file
If #1 fixes the issue, #2 is unnecessary.

All of these steps are part of the process of elimination and step-by-step diagnostics in order to rule-in or rule-out possible factors.

         ~ Vance PackardWhat happens if you open the menu with alt f, when you are in the
    files list, that is hold alt and press f, then press escape.  twice
    to close it.  Can you read the information then?  If so, that would
    be faster and easier than closing and running NVDA again.

can't use browse mode to read a google doc in firefox 7 messages,"Hi all,


I got an  email with a link for a google document that is housed on somebody's google drive. I'm not logged in, so I can't edit this doc, and I don't want to. But what I would like to do is read continuously with nvda plus down arrow on the desktop layout. But if browse mode is on, all I get is blank, blank, blank. With browse off, of course, continuous reading doesn't work, so all you can do is arrow down a line at a time which is laborious and slow in a 17-page document. Is there a solution here?


MaryThere's a built-in keystroke in google docs.  Holding down ctrl and alt, press a and then r and you should hear speech.  This is not as effective as continuous reading, as it doesn't move your editing cursor, but you can at least hear a say-all-ish reading.
Christopher Bartlett ""-- 
Christopher Bartlett""This is a good question. I had a similar experience with a Google doc
a while back, but I decided to view that document when logged in and
it worked fine. This is something that should be resolved though.I don't remember the keystroke off the top of my head, but last
      year I got this to work by turning on Braille Mode as well as
      Accessibility mode in Google Sheets/Docs. I don't know why this
      makes Browse Mode work better, but it actually does.I just checked, and it's not a shortcut, it's a setting.
    

    
    Open the menus in Google Sheets or Docs with alt+/, then press
      Right Arrow until you get to the Tools Submenu. Scroll down until
      you hear Accessibility, then hit Enter. Tab until you hear ""Turn
      On Braille Support"". It's a checkbox, so check it, then tab to OK.
    

    
    It seems bizarre. It seems like it will not help you with your
      screen-reader's accessibility of a thing, especially when there is
      already a Screen-Reader Support setting. But it really truly does
      work.Unfortunately some readers seem to feel that self voicing documents is a good idea and it to be frank stinks of lazy programming. You need your own screenreader to work for productivity reasons, after all.
Often the voice is nice and human, but very hard to speed up and hard to control where its reading from.

They should make a choice. I did wonder if there was a  Google doc converter that put the file into a format one can read. Some organisations seem to think the world uses Google or Outlook for calendars as well, not realising that those outside of their system are going to curse them grin.

    I agree, self-voiced text-reading can be a big problem. I
      personally prefer Espeak NG to nearly every other synthetic voice
      I have come across. More human-sounding should not mean sounds
        disinterested or unnaturally calm all the time. Until they
      have a humanlike voice that does inflection more
      organically/context-sensitively (and I say this knowing such a
      voice would probably cost a mint), I'll stick to Espeak, which I
      can at least max out inflection on without it sounding dreadful
      like Eloquence did when I tried it a long time ago. I do not need
      cartoonishly chipper, but if I am reading a story, inflection is
      essential, and I read a lot of fictional and non-fictional

code factory voices 7 messages,"Hello,

Some time agoI got a mnessage frrom NVDA to say that my code factory voices would not work with the next version of NVDA, so I haven't updated NVDA since, I have  some questions before I do something about it.


1. Do I need to purchase a new package?

2. can I just purchase a new license?

If I have to purchas a new package, will the one which is not an NVDA add on work with NVDA?

My present package is quite old I suppose, but as it is quite an expensive item, I am hoping that a product which is independant of NVDA will not stop working at a later point.


Any clarification will be most appreciated, Thank you.

    SteveJust to beon the safe side, yes, deactivate the license first before updating/installing. Also remember you’ll need to redownload the voices again once updated the driver. Good luck!

GeraEnviado desde mi iPhone SE (2nd Generation) de TelcelHello ~Steve and #Quentin,
    

    
    I have successfully updated my Code factory program, the only
      thing I found is that I needed to update NVDA first, obvious
      really but all done .
    

    
    Thank you for all your assistance.

        Thank you for that information, I have downloaded the program
          and am ready to install, do I need to uninstall my license key

          install over the old one? in other words, do I* need to
          uninstal the old version before installing the new one?

          Hi Jim,
            

            
            The Code Factory voices were updated around the same
              time NVDA 2022.1 came out.  You can download the updated
              voices at: https://codefactoryglobal.com/app-store/voices-for-nvda/
            

            
            Note if you are using any other add-ons which weren't
              compatible with NVDA 2022.1, please check https://addons.nvda-project.org/index.en.html
              as they may also have been updated.
            

            
            There is an add-on updater add-on which can help keep
              add-ons updated.

            Hello,

              

              Some time agoI got a mnessage frrom NVDA to say that my
              code factory 

              voices would not work with the next version of NVDA, so I
              haven't 

              updated NVDA since, I have  some questions before I do
              something about it.

              

              

              1. Do I need to purchase a new package?

              

              2. can I just purchase a new license?

              

              If I have to purchas a new package, will the one which is
              not an NVDA 

              add on work with NVDA?

              

              My present package is quite old I suppose, but as it is
              quite an 

              expensive item, I am hoping that a product which is
              independant of NVDA 

              will not stop working at a later point.

              

              

              Any clarification will be most appreciated, Thank you.

You probably won't have permission to create a folder called desktop in the root directory of your C drive, at least not automatically, but you can do that.

Lots of files and folders will be created under c:\desktop.

If you were going to do this on your actual user desktop, like c:\Users\mcLeod\Desktop, it would be very messy and you shouldn't.

You should instead use a subdirectory in that case, like c:\Users\mcLeod\Desktop\NVDA_portable

do same as routing curser 6 messages,"Hi,
I have a radio programming program that I have to select the com port that 
the radio is able to be accessed to.
With Jaws and NVDA, when I tab in the window, it only goes to enter and 
cancel, but insert B reads com ports of which I can check, one of available 
ports.
With Jaws, I can route Jaws to PC and find the port I want, and either do a 
left mouse click with the number pad or I can at the point I'm on the port I 
want, route PC to Jaws, either way will select the port with a check.
I cannot figure out how to do this with NVDA.
I do insert num 7 and it says review mode, and using insert minus or insert 
5 I can move around to different windows, but the closest I get is where it 
says
com select window, but the reading and arrow keys and tab only go to enter 
and cancel.
If NVDA is able to do stuff like this, it isn't intuitive, or there needs to 
better information on this.
I know lots of people for whom this is exactly why they don't use NVDA.
Thanks for any assistance with this.

GlennProbably using object navigation would work.  I did a tutorial on
    object navigation.  Brian is hosting it at this link:

https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1HZ7oqhtmwWXGVvAivYL_0pi9AcHc3WjZ

    

    I'll describe what has a good chance of working but depending on how
    you use your computer, you may find it well worth your while to
    learn how to use object navigation.

    

    For now, be in object navigation mode, issue the command numpad
    insert numpad 1 until you hear no previous navigation mode, or
    something similar.

    Then try moving with numpad insert numpad 4 to move back by object
    and numpad insert numpad 6 to move forward.  You have a good chance
    of finding what you want that way.  When you are on the item you
    want to activate, use the command numpad insert numpad enter. Numpad
    enter is the long key farthest down on the right most column of the
    numpad.

    

    I am giving desktop keyboard commands.  I don't know the laptop
    commands.

    

    GeneThe action is similar but the nomenclature is different, as with any
application. 

Try NVDA+Numpad Slash to move the mouse pointer to the current navigator
object. Then try Numpad Slash on its own to emulate a left mouse click.Glenn, perhaps this article will help you transition.https://gttprogram.blog/2018/12/20/switching-from-jaws-to-nvda-nvaccess-nvda-community-wiki-%C2%B7-github/ But, the User Guide exists too, and easy to navigate and read.Hi Gene,
When I do insert 1 on the number pad, until it says no next object, the 
arrow keys don't move off of the last tab item, either cancel or enter.
I think NVDA cannot do as much as Jaws.
Does NVDA have touch cursors?
Sometimes in some programs, I have to use that with Jaws.
I've put keyboard help on with NVDA and explored key combinations, and I 
think I may have come across touch cursor, but maybe I'm remembering 
something else.
GlennI don't know which arrow keys you are referring to.  You use numpad
    keys to move when you move in object navigation.  

    

    JAWS has a touch cursor and object navigation which is the rough
    equivalent of object navigation.

    

    If you work with my tutorial, you will learn commands for using
    object navigation and how to move among and into and out of objects.

dynamic content in the windows sound mixer. 7 messages,"Hi all,


Here's the scenario. I want to change the playback device for certain apps. I can accomplish this with the windows sound mixer, but, the problem I have is the list keeps updating as it is a dynamic list based on loudest to softest in terms of which app is putting out how much sound etc.

How can I prevent this long enough to be able to change the output of certain apps to go to the devices I'd like them to? for instance, iTunes and Spotify, neither of which have that functionality in their own application, hense the need to utilise the windows sound mixer.

winamp and various others do not have this restriction.If you go to the advanced sound properties under sound you should be able to get to that list easier and I believe the order sticks.ok, I'll have a look.is that through windows settings? I forgot to mention I'm using windows 11.That's actually where I do this in windows 10. I'm thinking it's the same place.  Good luck.and that's where I have the problem. even reloading NVDA and reopening settings which sometimes resolves the issue, is even working today.Yes.
Also, if it's a removable soud card
(i.e. anything bluetooth/HDMI/USB,
Do Not UnPair/Disconnect It!
Best case:
Windows assumes a default built-in device and plays the sound straight away.

error notes? in beta? I wonder why. 2 messages,"None of these ""error"" sounds happened in the release version of NVDA, so why now? Maybe they refer to errors, but no announcement of them happens by NVDA, or maybe the error itself overwhelms NVDA'S announcement?

Anyway, whatever, I am getting the error sounds many times in this beta.

Yes, you are going to be ranted at, because you have been a member for a long time, and this has been asked and answered again and again and again.

In any piece of software, there are ""normal errors"" that end users are not notified about in the production releases.  NVDA Betas have had, by design, an alert given to the end user of a beta about these kinds of errors being logged, so that they can be aware and check the logs if they're doing heavy-duty testing and wish to look ""under the hood.""  This is not new.  This has been the case literally for years.

A search of the group archive on [""error tone"" beta] turns up information on this by the reams.

I expect, as a matter of course, that members on a group such as this one will pay attention when this information is shared, and file it if they feel it necessary.  And that our membership will, as a matter of course, turn to the archive to see if something has been ""asked and answered"" before asking again.  This is standard protocol seemingly everywhere but on these groups.  It needs to become standard protocol on ALL groups.


Searching a Groups.io Topics Page/Archive
Browsing a Groups.io Topics Page/Archive

Those who wish to be offended can be offended. It is long past time that this nonsense of not checking the archives STOPS, particularly when a member is not new here and should have every reason to suspect that something has likely been discussed before, probably repeatedly. It is common courtesy to do so BEFORE you ask a question.

This topic is now locked.

curtis@...Hi,

These are add-on errors. Specifically:


TripleTalk USB: an issue with the add-on manifest.
Conflict between NVDA Extension and Sound Splitter add-ons when trying to initialize wave playback subsystem in NVDA.
Inability to access a specific web resource from an add-on.


When you do send log fragments (if you must do so), please only include the fragment that results in errors (typically a fragment that starts with ""error"" followed by timestamp and traceback). While the info log does not contain input and output data, it still contains enough information to figure out specs of your system and user path.

A tip for folks parsing NVDA logs: the log analyzed is one of those that include tracebacks from add-ons. You can determine involvement of add-ons in error messages if parts of the traceback refer to what appears to be NVDA user configuration folder path, and that probability increases if the error traceback does end with an error coming from an add-on. I state the last sentence like this (increase in probability) because:


Add-ons can and sometimes do patch NVDA screen reader itself in predictable and unpredictable ways. This stems from not NVDA, but due to Python internals. The fragment about an add-on saying that another add-on patched parts of NVDA is a good example.
Add-ons can call NVDA features without realizing that it doesn't exist or things have changed. This is the reason why just editing the manifest will not work on all add-ons.


I think the log fragment posted indicates issues beyond NV Access's control; no, actually these are issues beyond NVDA developers' control as add-ons are involved in the log fragment, more so for this fragment. I suggest contacting authors of affected add-ons (for Sound Splitter, I have no plans to resolve this at this time as I'm no longer maintaining it).

Cheers,

JosephI wouldn't want to generalize but when I upgraded from one version
    of NVDA to another, even with compatible add-ons, some of them
    didn't work.  Is it common for add-ons to need reinstalling when you
    create an installed version from a portable version or upgrade?

    

    You talked about a tripple talk problem.  I'm not sure if that
    accounts for NVDA appearing not to run because it should revert to
    the default NVDA synthesizer if it can't run the assigned one but
    even so, it makes me wonder if my suspicion was correct yesterday,
    that the screen-reader could be running without speech.

    

    GeneHi,

Even if an add-on advertises itself as compatible, it does not mean the actual add-on code was edited to use changes from NVDA itself. This is more so if a version of NVDA introduced changes that can break certain add-ons, most notably speech synthesizer add-ons, made complicated if something (a different add-on, perhaps) other than these made internal changes to (patched) NVDA that renders some synthesizers inoperable or fail to load properly.

As for add-ons and installing NVDA from portable versions: yes if the user checked ""copy portable user configuration"" checkbox. If one or more incompatible add-ons are detected, users might be asked to review them.

As for running NVDA with or without speech: yes, it is possible to run NVDA without speech. Speaking of speech syntehsizers, if an external speech synthesizer fails to load, NVDA will resort to either eSpeak NG or Windows OneCore voices if running on Windows 7/8.x or Windows 10 and later, respectively.

Regarding TripleTalk issue, the log reports an issue with add-on manifest validation. This is because the add-on summary data is not formatted as a proper Python string. Without going into technical details (ask on NVDA add-ons list or me privately), if the add-on manifest data is not written correctly, Python (NOT NVDA) will recognize manifest data as something other than text. More specifically:


manifest = text1, text2: recognized by Python as a list, not text, fails add-on manifest validation.
manifest = ""text1, text2"": recognized by Python as text, add-on manifest is valid.


Cheers,

JosephMy errors;  I deleted the configuration folder under ""roaming,"" and it was very large, so due to it probably having old stuff in it, (which hadn't been deleted), (among other things) all is ok now, no more errors.

Funny, though in versions earlier than this current beta, no error sounds came up but the same or similar errors were generated in the log.

I just wasn't apprised of them because there wasn't any error sounds until this beta gave me plenty of them.

curtis@...Yes that was part of my deduction. I think they should obliterate the current install, and start afresh with no add ons at all and allow it to use whatever it defaults to. Normally either 1 core or Espeak. If neither come up look at the log with a portable copy or narrator and look to see if the system sees sound hardware. As I say, I have known occasions where the sound drivers were not initialised when NVDA looks for audio devices, it then sets sound to silence.

Group administration has asked, on multiple occasions, that full logs and log segments not be posted to the group.  There are very good reasons for this, including protecting the privacy of the member whose log material may contain information that would be considered private.

We ask that you note that you have a log or log segment available for review if an assistant wishes to see it, and that said materials be shared privately, not on the group.  Anyone who is capable of interpreting logs who wants to see one will ask if such is needed to figure out what's happening.

"for the third time, filling out a PDF 84 messages","Hi all,
This will be the last time I ask this. I find it hard to believe
nobody on here knows the answer to what seems like a fairly easy
problem to fix, but I've asked this twice since Thursday, and have
gotten nowhere, when every other question on this list including my
other one has had an answer within a couple of hours. Yes I could ask
for sighted help and probably will if I don't get an answer, but this
form was done correctly, unlike lots of PDFs I've seen, so I should be
able to fill it out without sighted help.
I'm using the latest version of NVDA and Adobe Reader. NVDA will see
that edit fields in the PDF exist, but I'm having the following
issues:
1. I cannot tab through them like I would a form on a webpage.
2. Pressing enter when focused on an edit field does not activate
focus mode as it would on a webpage.
3. Manually activating focus mode with control+space works, but does
not appear to actually fill in the forms as would be expected. How
does this work?
BobCan you fill out the form in word? It probably was done correctly but not for your screen reader.  Good luck.I'm not writing as I am to give you a hard time and I hope you don't
    consider my direct writing to be other than my attempt to make the
    following points strongly and clearly.

    

    You say you can't move through the form and you say it is done
    properly.  You don't know if it is done properly.  If you can't move
    through it, maybe it isn't.  

    

    You are assuming that just because a field your screen-reader sees
    as edit is available, that it can be filled in and is accessible. 
    Just because a car has a motor, does it run?  What if the car is out
    of gas or the motor is damaged?  

    

    There are uncommon web sites where links aren't properly defined for
    accessibility and they can't be clicked on by the keyboard.  They
    look accessible and the screen-reader announces them as links but
    some links require the mouse to be used.  This appears to be a
    choice a web designer makes and it isn't the way links function
    unless the designer specifies this.  That's very fortunate for us. 
    

    

    Things aren't necessarily as the screen-reader indicates in terms of
    accessibility.  There are some things it doesn't know about and
    perhaps can't be aware of.

    

    You have gotten another question answered.  Why would people be
    ignoring this one?  Maybe people don't know the answer.  

    

    If you want others to try working with the form to see if they have
    the same problems and can figure a way around them, if the form is
    one you don't object to sharing, asking for volunteers may result in
    people asking to be sent copy.

    

    You are working with browse mode.  As far as I know, in a properly
    designed PDF document, you should be able to move and edit is though
    you were working with a web page.  

    

    GeneGene,
You do have a tendency to be rather blunt, but your response to me was
no more than usual, and I didn't take any offense. To answer your
questions, I guess I should have been a little clearer in my original
post. I can in fact move through the form using my arrow keys, but I
cannot tab through the form. I think I've seen websites like the ones
you are referring to, but I don't think that's what we're dealing with
here. I downloaded a completely unrelated form a couple months back
and it acts the same way. I just opened a third form that I was able
to fill out when I needed it, but I was using System Access at the
time and it acts as the other two forms do when viewed with NVDA. So,
unless there's a hidden trick when completing PDFs that nobody knows
about, I don't think this is a problem with the file itself, but
rather one with the way NVDA interacts with Adobe Reader.
I wasn't quite sure what to think about the lack of response to this
question, but I do find it hard to believe that out of the probably
hundreds if not at least dozens of people on this list, nobody would
know the answer. Surely there would be someone on this list who has
encountered a fillable PDF and has filled it out using NVDA and could
give me some tips.Have you tried different forums from different websites? The 64 bit version of adobe dc reader? A web browser? Opening it in word? I hope my last post made it where I do ask all of these questions

    same screen-reader?  Do you have JAWS on the machine?  Do you have

    You don't know how the specific form you are working with will react
    with other screen--readers. You can't assume.

    

    I have never heard of any trick using NVDA to fill out PDF forms and
    I've been on this list for years, maybe ten.  If people had the
    problem you had with NVDA and were successful with other
    screen-readers, I would think I would have seen some discussion in
    all the years I've been on the list.  On the other hand, if you find
    that you can fill out the form using another screen-reader, that is
    something to submit a Github  ticket for, perhaps after asking
    people if they can duplicate the problem to see if it is a general
    one.  

    

    I can't tell you how or if you can fill out the form using NVDA but
    I have suggested ways of testing the problem.

    

    GeneBob, have you tried pressing space when you navigate to a field, to possibly activate the field?

Honestly, it has been so long since I've done a fillable PDF, that I simply don't remember how I did it. I tend to read PDFs in Edge, but can't remember if it does fillables.

To answer your question, I just tried opening said file in Firefox,
and it doesn't see the edit fields. My machine doesn't give me the
option by default to open the file in Word, just Adobe Reader and the
two browsers, Edge and Firefox. I actually thought I could get by with
only using Firefox to read PDF files, but when I thought I needed to
fill out the form I'm currently using as a test case a couple months
ago, that's when I downloaded Adobe Reader.
Gene, to answer your question about System Access, I could try that to
use this PDF, but I've never installed it, and I'm not sure SA To Go
works with Edge. Microsoft has announced that Internet Explorer will
not work on Windows 10 within the next month I believe, so that may
work to fill out the PDF in question, but that's not going to be a
long term solution.Again, could we see the file for ourselves?
Do you have Dropbox, GoogleDrive, something like that?My machine doesn't give me the option by default to open the file in Word.

But, you can still run Word, go to File, go to Open, etc.What did you use System Access with before to work with the other
    PDF form?  If you used Adobe, then System Access should work with it

    accessible using System Access but you may want to try.  

    

    GeneYou simply click open with, then choose apps, then choose more apps and word will be in the list, as long as you have winword installed. It wont' be in there by default though no.You are absolutely right, System Access should work with Adobe reader
to fill out this form, but as I said, I don't know how much longer
I'll have access to System Access, as from what I've heard, they
haven't made any updates to make that screen reader work with Edge or
any browser other than IE, which is being discontinued pretty soon.It works with other browsers.  At present, Internet Explorer needs
    to be running for System Access to run, but if it is running, you
    can have both Internet Explorer opened to keep System Access to Go
    running and open the browser you want to use with it.

    

    I checked two or three months ago but I didn't find any information
    about whether they will continue System Access to Go after Internet
    Explorer is retired and what browser it will have to see is opened
    for it to run.

    

    I didn't say System Access To Go would work with your specific
    file.  It should work with a file if System Access works with it.

    

    GeneBob,

I have watched the messages all day and held back while so many were answering you.

Firstly, Firefox cannot read PDF files. You need either edge or Chrome or Adobe.

If you want to open the .pdf file in Word then use the context menu to open it with word.

Here are the steps:
1. locate the file you want to open;
2. Press shift + f10 or the application key beside the right control key;
3. Press ""n""  twice until you hear ""Open With"";
5. press right arrow and down until you hear ""Microsoft Word"" and press enter.

The file will then open in Word.


All the best,

help with an edit field 28 messages,"Hi all,
Is the edit field on this page not a conventional one? I play Heardle
every day, and it looks like the edit box on this page should work
similar to that one, but I can't seem to get the one here to work. All
I hear is NVDA telling me that this is an edit box that contains
multiple selections, and how many results are available, but I can't
seem to choose any results. The same happens when you're trying to
select a school to send to, and I suspect I won't have to enter as
much information as it's asking for if I could choose a result. Any
help on this would be appreciated, as I've put this off for two weeks
already. The link is
https://tsorder.studentclearinghouse.org/school/select
Thanks,
BobWhen you are on the line that says enter the name of the school,
    press enter.  That makes the field editable and you can then press
    enter again to go into focus mode if you aren't automatically placed
    in it.

    

    GeneYes, that's standard edit commands. However, when I start typing the
name of a school, NVDA says ""this is an auto complete element and
there are # results available. Keyboard users, use up and down arrows
to select an option."" The # in the example is, as one might guess, an
actual number. However, when using up and down arrow with NVDA in
focus mode, I just get the same auto complete message and NVDA reads
what I've already typed in, it won't let me actually choose a result.
The question is how do I actually choose a result as intended?Try alt down arrow.  I had to do this in a trail head module today.

Good luck.Hmm, unless my NVDA is broken, I'd say that the JavaScript for the autocomplete has a bug in it that makes it really hard to pick the school unless you brute force the entries one by one.


As a workaround, are you able to request a transcript from your school's self-service portal? For example, I can sign into my school's information system and I see an option to request an official transcript and have it mailed somewhere that is independent from the national student clearinghouse.


I welcome any additional feedback from others; so far I've tried Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer with the latest version of NVDA. I don't have Firefox installed on this machine for me to try at the moment, but that may be helpful.Have you tried it with Narrator? I have also found if you use chromvox it sometimes works.No, it isn't standard.  I had to press enter on select a school to
    make the field editable in the first place.  Then I had to press
    enter again, since  I am using manual switching in NVDA, to go into
    forms mode.  You may have to as well, since you are in a field that
    is not initially editable.  

    

    As far as the select a school edit field is concerned, is that the
    field you are discussing?  I'll look at the field again but I
    thought I heard select  a number when I was 

    

    GeneIt appears i was wrong about the edit field.  It appears to be a
    standard edit field.  I didn't hear anything about number of results
    and moving up and down, as I recall.  I did try using the search
    field where you enter a key word to find your school and I then got
    results like yours.  

    

    I figured out how to find a school name.  Its a little work but you
    can accomplish this in the following way:

    Follow the key word search link.

    An edit field will become available.  If you are not in forms mode
    go into forms mode.  Just pressing enter where you are after
    following the link should do it.

    Be in forms mode in the key word search edit field.

    Type a word such as Chicago.

    You will hear how many results there are.

    Down arrow to the first one.  You won't hear the school read but you
    will hear that you are on the first result.

    Press enter.  You have now placed the name in the field you are in
    and it can be read while in forms mode.  I don't recall if you
    automatically hear it but you can use read current line or maybe
    just pressing the down or up arrow will read it.

    If that is not the result you want, select all, control a, and press
    delete.

    Write Chicago again.

    Down arrow to the second result and press enter.

    Again, you will be able to hear the word.

    Follow this procedure until you hear the name you want.

    Once you do, it is in the field it should be in and you can then
    activate the continue button, which will now be available.

    

    On considering this further, I don't know if this is a bug in
    anything.  It may be that the results shown as you move aren't
    announced because the function isn't designed to be accessible.

    

    GeneI just did a bit more experimenting.  I had tried this in Firefox
    but I then used the Brave browser.  The procedure works in both.

    

    Also, when using default screen-reader settings, if you press enter
    on the key word link, you are automatically placed in focus mode and
    can type the word, as I described doing.

    

    GeneQuoting:On considering this further, I don't know if this is a bug in anything.  It may be that the results shown as you move aren't announced because the function isn't designed to be accessible.
end quote: Wow, wouldn’t that be considered a “major” bug then? Or,At least a “big flaw”?Isn’t that bad if someone designs a control on a page to be purposefully inaccessible?(especially a school clearing house)? Just curious? Please advise as you like. Mike M. Mike mcglashonEmail: Michael.mcglashon@...Ph: 618 783 9331I don't consider lack of accessibility to be a bug.  A bug is an
    unintended behavior.  Saying a lack of accessibility is a bug
    implies that the item was intended to be accessible but isn't
    because of unanticipated problem or problems.  

    

    If a stove isn't accessible and isn't designed to be, that isn't a
    bug.  You may call it a flaw, a serious flaw, you may describe it as
    you wish in terms of advocating for more accessibility, but it isn't
    a bug.  It is operating as designed.  

    

    If my stove is designed to be accessible and the speech is giving
    inaccurate numbers as I move through settings, that is a bug.  

    

    GeneFair enough,Point well taken.  Please advise as you like. Mike M. Mike mcglashonEmail: Michael.mcglashon@...Ph: 618 783 9331Gene wrote:

As an accessibility tester I disagree. I understand what you are saying in your example of a stove which doesn’t take inclusive design into account. However, if you have a Web site which has no labels on form fields or which doesn’t expose
 an edit field to a screen reader this is definitely considered a bug or defect and needs to be treated as such.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgI didn't say anything about what other words someone might want to
    use, but bug is not correct.  You might want to call it a flaw or an
    omission, or use some sort of word or phrase that indicates that it
    is no longer acceptable not to include accessibility, but it isn't a
    bug.  

    

    One definition from Google I just looked up is:

    ""an error in a computer program or system.""

    

    Lack of accessibility isn't an error.  It may be unconscionable,
    unacceptable or you may wish to use other wording, but it is not an
    error.

    

    GeneAlso, consider that referring to lack of accessibility aws  a bug
    makes it sound benign, it was just an unforeseen and unforeseeable
    error that didn't become evident through testing and evaluation
    until now.  Lack of accessibility is either a lack of knowledge or a
    lack of concern or a belief that it isn't necessary for your
    product.  A bug is something that is in a program that isn't known
    until testing brings it out.

    

    GeneLack of accessibility isn’t an error? I am quite certain that nobody in the accessibility field will agree with you but I am done with this conversation. You are free to respond to this if you like but I will, unfortunately, resume my habit
 of skipping your messages so your response will not be read by me.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgThat's a real example of both civility and intellectual open
    mindedness.  I didn't know you harbor such hostility toward me.  

    

    If you can't be civil and you refuse to discuss what I say without
    attacking me, don't bother.

    

    Your last message displays a logical fallacy.  You said that you are
    confident no one in the accessibility field will agree with me.  So
    what?  That is arguing from authority and doesn't prove anything. 
    How many people believed the world was flat before Columbuss?  

    

    You have not, in either answer, presented any reasons for believing
    what you believe.  You just say what you believe.  

    

    GeneI apologize;I did not mean to cause a rift. Please advise as you like. Mike M. Mike mcglashonEmail: Michael.mcglashon@...Ph: 618 783 9331You didn't cause one.  it isn't your responsibility if people
    disagree about something you said if you aren't expressing something
    you think is controversial.  In addition, a little controversy even
    if you say something people may disagree with, is alright as long as
    you are staying within the list rules.  I may express an opinion
    about a program, for example, that is controversial.  There are
    going to be disagreements.

    

    GeneThis is a terribly designed autocomplete. However, there is a workaround but it involves using object navigation.
Start typing in the first few letters of the desired school. Once you do this use your numeric keypad, assuming that you have a full-size keyboard, and press insert numpad-4 to move across the objects until you hear NVDA announce the word
 “list.”
Once you hear this press insert numpad-2 to drill down into that list. Insert numpad-6 should move from one item to the next in the list of schools.
When you hear the school that you want press insert numpad-enter to select it.
Next, navigate with the tab key to the Continue button and select it.
If you don’t have a full-size keyboard I’m afraid you’ll either need to look up the laptop equivalents for these hotkeys or use a full-size keyboard as I will admit that I never learned the laptop layout.

      however, in saying that, it's not always best to go get it
      immediately anyway due to the fact that if you have incompatible
      add-ons, especially those you use all the time, you're going to
      find those self same add-ons becoming showstoppers.
    right now I have far too many to justify the update.If you don’t get an error saying that CF add on is broken I would go head and update.  I have never updated CF add on ever since I bought the thing last year.I’ve heard the clat voices and the guy sounds like he got his teeth knocked out. Not my type of voice IMHO, actually it sounds like Espeak with that variation, of the teeth, at least to my ear.  Lol!For Windows 11 specifically, you can find the full what's new here:
But just from the blurb, there are a few things for Windows 11.  Firstly using UIA in newer versions Word by default, which should make it much more responsive.  There are also various Windows 11 bug fixes, for apps such as Calculator, Console, Terminal, Mail and Emoji Panel.
I believe the Code Factory update should be out soon, and hopefully the other add-ons which haven't yet been updated will be out soon too!

    For if interpretors I have modified the manafest, there are
      issues open on the github for this.
    easy table navigator, extended winamp, a few others.
    zoom enhancements does have addons on community.
    vlc does to but addon updater aint catching it but its there.
    99.9% of addons are compatible.So I just got a reply from Codefactory, to a ticket regarding compatibility with NVDA 2022.1 that I submitted way back in April. Below is their response:
Good morning,
We are aware that a breaking NVDA update was released today.
We've been working on the addon, but unfortunately our update will take a few more days to complete.
Thank you for your patience.
The Code Factory technical team.Hi: I figure they were working on it. I have to admit I have not been reading everything that came across the list, so there may have been posted some kind of warning about this issue. Regardless, this is not a showstopper for me. I am sure NVDA developers had a good reason for the changes that were made, and NVDA’s advantages outweigh any temporary loss of convenience.  Choice is a good thing, and NVDA gives us one more choice. Actually, the thing I like the best about NVDA is that the screen review method is a little similar to the old DOS screen reader ASAP, and that was my number one go-to in my DOS days.  I still have my copy of ASAP and pull it out whenever I access a DOS program. I’ll keep checking CodeFactory’s Web site.",1157,43,0.037165082,0.037165082,1,1185,38.72,8.35,67.85,71.85,26.93,16.03,82.36,65.23,53.76,14.09,7.85,5.74,0.42,1.1,0.17,0.42,6.24,13.08,5.57,2.7,12.24,9.54,6.5,5.91,2.11,17.97,3.71,3.38,2.45,0.68,1.6,0.25,13.25,1.69,11.39,2.11,1.69,2.19,2.11,0.42,4.22,0,5.06,4.14,0.84,1.86,1.35,0.42,0,0,0.08,0,6.5,3.54,0.68,1.18,0,0.08,2.03,3.04,0,0,0,0.25,1.1,0.17,0,0.93,3.04,0,0.42,2.36,0.25,0.08,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.59,0.51,0.76,0,0.17,0,0.08,0.17,0.34,7.17,6.16,0.51,1.1,3.54,0.84,0.84,0,6.33,3.29,4.98,2.45,0.76,0.76,0,0,0,18.4,6.58,4.56,0.42,0.25,1.94,4.64
how to fix pronouncing abbreviations in NVDA? 6 messages,"Hello. I was wondering whenever NVDA comes across abbreviations it kind of mispronounces them. For example instead of sd, it says South Dakota. I want it to say the letters  sd even if sd is in all caps. Another one is instead of HP, it says horse power. It is quite annoying. If I come across these types of things I have to go back and double check as to what I am reading, I would really like to fix this. How would I do this since I did read something about this in the speech dictionaries, how would I access them since I don't have anything with touch jesters, I use the keyboard for everything. Any help you could send my way would be great. Thank you.What I do in such cases is to open the default speech dictionary in
    the following way:

    NVDA key n, then open preferences. 

    up arrow to speech dictionaries and press enter. 

    Press enter again to open the default dictionary.

    Tab to the add button and press the space bar.

    Type the abbreviation, all capitals if it is capitalized when you
    come across it, and then tab to the pronounced as field.

    Type what you want said, like ssd

    Tab to a field that says anywhere.  I think you will want whole word
    so the letters are only spoken when found by themselves as the
    abbreviation.  Down arrow in the field to whole word.  I haven't
    worked with abbreviations so I may be wrong about using whole word
    but you can see if the entries work properly.

    Tab to and activate the OK button.

    Tab to and activate the next OK button.

    The dictionary will close and the entry will be made.

    Let us know if you have problems.

    

    GeneWhat synthesizer are you using?NVDA passes the information on to the synthesizer, as it sees it (""sd"" or ""SD"" in this case), it is up to the synth to work out how to pronounce it and unfortunately they often try to be clever and work out what abbreviations are rather than simply saying what is presented.
Using a different voice or synthesizer might give a different result, but the way to absolutely override it is, as others have indicated, with the speech dictionary.  We posted a walkthrough of creating an entry for exactly this reason in our In-Process blog last year: https://www.nvaccess.org/post/in-process-16th-april-2021/#Dictionaries (The steps haven't changed).
Kind regards

Quentin,

Not to argue with you (as what you say is accurate), but I don't consider it ""being clever"" for a synth to try to work out what unpronouncable character sequences might mean, and pronounce the meaning, rather than always doing a character by character reading.

To me, any of the 2-character US State abbreviations are more likely to make the most sense when announced as their state names rather than the two characters.  There are, of course, exceptions.

We see the same sort of thing when it comes to numbers.  I'd rather hear fifteen pronounced as such rather than one five.  But there are definitely contexts where huge numbers are in constant use where it's more handy to have them announced digit-by-digit, which can be achieved, but that would be the exception case rather than the rule when handed to something to pronounce.  

And, of course, context always matters.  In the case of numbers, US ZIP Codes as well as Social Security Numbers are never pronounced by human readers as a numeric value, but as a digit sequence.

Synth writers are trying to apply certain rules about what to pronounce how, and when, based on how it's generally done by most speakers.  Mistakes are, of course, inevitable, and that's the beauty of dictionaries to be able to handle these mistakes on a case-by-case or, in the case of regular expressions, class-by-class, basis.

You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.
     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedOh I didn't necessarily mean ""try to be clever"" sarcastically.  There are plenty of good examples of algorithms deciphering some complex meaning out of something.  In the case of abbreviations, it's tricky both because there can be multiple meanings of any given abbreviation and how do you know exactly which one is being referred to, and there is often not enough context to determine, even if the synthesizer was programmed to be able to tell.  I don't *think* any of them are, but in any case, reading with ""say all"" could theoretically work, but if you are moving word by word, then all the synthesizer would be passed is ""Dr."" - without any surrounding text, it's impossible to know if the meaning is ""Drive"" (as in the street type) or ""Doctor"", so in that case, it is usually better to just read the two letters (with or without the dot depending on punctuation).
The thing which makes it particularly frustrating, is that there is no way to tell the synthesizer what you want - whether you want it to make those guesses about meaning or not.  It would be really great if there was a flag we could pass it which said ""make your best guess as to meaning"" or ""simply read the exact text passed and do not change anything"" - at least if that was the case we could add an option to the voice settings and users could make their own decision.
As it is, all we can do now is use the speech dictionary to override what gets sent to the synthesizer to try to correct assumptions if they are wrong.
Even in the case of numbers, yes we know users want more control over that, and we do have at least one open issue for it, and it should be theoretically possible (I haven't looked at what technical blockers there are currently, if any) - but again, all we can do is give you the opportunity to make a blanket ruling about how you want numbers pronounced.  We can't choose, if it's a zip / post code do this, if it's a phone number, do that, if it's my bank balance (well ok, it's going to read single digits for that anyway! *grin*)...

That’s certainly an option if you absolutely insist on being able to use the Eloquence or Vocalizer voices. However, many people may be able to adjust to Microsoft’s voices as their newer ones are quite pleasant to listen
 to. As I grew up with more old-school speech products I’m personally still a fan of Espeak and still often resort to using it.
I’m just trying to say that buying another screen reader isn’t a user’s only option if the Code Factory voices aren’t affordable.
Also, Code Factory sells 
SAPI-compliant versions of Eloquence for around $60.00 U.S. which might be a bit easier to purchase. These voices can be used with NVDA as well as Narrator.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgI've only tried the Windows 10 Microsoft voices that come by default
    with the American installation of Windows 10.  I find the voices to
    vary significantly in quality.

    

    Of the installed voices, I find Zira to be the best in terms of the
    combination of a more human sounding voice and enunciation.  I find
    it superior to the Vocalizer voices I've sampled.  

    

    People have very different opinions about voices they like but if
    people are trying or want to try Vocalizer voices, I think they
    should compare them with Microsoft voices.

    

    GeneHi, Gene, The Microsoft Zira voice is my favorite one too. She sounds even better than the Vocalizer voices in my opinion. Rosemarie   Sent from Mail for WindowsNot to beat a dead horse but it also occurs to me that if someone can’t afford the voices from Code Factory then they surely won’t be able to afford a screen reader that already contains those voices since that screen reader will cost even
 more money.

www.DavidGoldfield.orgAnd using a for profit screen-reader, you will keep having to spend
    money on an ongoing basis, ;purchasing an annual license every year
    or purchasing a user service agreement, if that is the correct name
    for a longer period of time.  When you purchase the voices being
    discussed, you pay once.  

    

    The implication that it is cheaper to buy a for profit screen-reader
    than it is to buy voices such as the ones being discussed is wrong.

    

    GeneYeah, you have the right idea. I don’t know what this stands for but with a Jaws licence  it’s called a SMA. You pay for it every 2 years.  I’d rather get an addon from NVDA core voices and you pay for them if you choose to.  With other screen readers like Jaws you have to pay for everything that comes with it like the voices and other scripts / addons you are forced to purchase. Where as NVDA you can choose to get the addons you want.    Sent from Mail for WindowsMost add-ons in NVDA are free.  Certain voice add-ons are sold by
    certain companies for profit.  

    

    I don't know what you mean about core voices in NVDA.  There are
    free Microsoft One Core voices that are a free part of Windows and
    that work in NVDA.  Other voices you can add, whether free or paid,
    aren't referred to as Core.  

    

    There are arguments for and against the JAWS approach regarding
    features and the NVDA approach, using add-ons for many features
    available in JAWS.  If you want or use features in JAWS NVDA doesn't
    have, you may consider purchasing it to be either necessary or
    desirable.  

    

    There are advantages in the add-on model NVDA uses and
    disadvantages, just as there are advantages and disadvantages in the
    model JAWS uses.

    

    Depending on your needs and to an extent preferences, one
    screen-reader may serve you better.  

    

    I think we are in a particularly good position, having various
    screen-readers to choose from.

Thank you

Howard or <HT>I run into this a lot too and would appreciate any ideas about how to bypass it.Use reader mode in your browser if available. Gets rid of all the crap.


MaryMary's suggestion about using a reader mode, when available, is an excellent one.

Another thing is using something like uBlock Origin (my favorite, and way more than just an ad-blocker) in your browser of choice if said browser isn't something like Brave or Vivaldi where those same functions are largely built-in on security and privacy-focused browsers.

I haven't surfed the web in literally decades without an ad-blocker of some sort active, so I see very little of this material.  If it drives me insane for ""visual clutter"" distractions I can only imagine what it does as far as needlessly making accessibility to ""real content"" way more tedious.

The difference between a top-flight creative man and the hack is his ability to express powerful meanings indirectly.
         ~ Vance PackardIf you want to remove the word inserted, uncheck Editor revisions in NVDA's Document Formatting settings.
But if that still isn't enough for you and you want to remove the advertisements altogether, look into an adblocker. I've found uBlock Origin works well enough with NVDA.
You'll sometimes need to deactivate it on certain sites, but if you're browsing in Chrome, F6 will get you to the address bar, then tab will get you to the set of buttons. After that, you can right arrow to uBlock Origin and activate it with space.What is Reader mode?
Is it the same as immersive reader?
I seem to believe that if I use immersive reader it just continuously reads the whole webpage with no control to read line by line word by word, paragraph, etc.I believe ""inline frames"" in the JAWS settings is supposed to let you skip the advertising stuff.I don't know about imersive reader. Reader mode strips out all the social media links e.g. ""share on facebook"" etc, as well as all the annoying ads that are sprinkled through many pages, letting you,k for example, see the ingredients and instructions for a recipe without the intervening disruptive ads. Or you can read an entire article without all those interruptions. In firefox, which is the easiest to use, in my view, you just hit f9 to invoke reader mode. That's all there is to it. When you move to another site, its turned off, so must be turned on each time you want to use it. You can also tottle it off if you're on a site where it didn't work well for some reason, just by hitting f9 again.


MarySorry about that.  I'm on the wrong screen reader.Immersive reader is another name for reader mode.  It won't take
    away control from your screen-reader.  It may have a read aloud
    button where reading is not done by the screen-reader but you have
    to manually start that option.

    

    GeneOK, so if I’m using chrome or edge,Do I hit F9 to turn on reader mode/immersive reader?I ask because sometimes it comes up on some websites and other times it doesn’t.I hear jaws or Nbba or somebody like that say immersive reader sometimes but not all the time.In Firefox or Edge, yes. Chrome is a little different. It has a Reader Mode too, but it’s not enabled by default (unless this changed in very recent versions, but I don’t think so). You’ll need to type chrome://flags into the address bar. This will open a page of “deep settings” that control various browser functions. Look for “enable reader mode” (you can use the search box to do this, therea re a *lot* of flags in there) and activate it. Now, you’ll be able to enter reader mode on certain webpages. F9 won’t do it…I think the keystroke is ctrl-shift-r, and you’ll also see a button for it located in the address bar area if it’s available.As I recall, in Chrome, this feature is hidden and must be turned on
    in the experimental settings category of settings.  this category of
    settings is not available in the ususal settings interface.  I'd
    have to look information about it again, but it is not intended that
    the general user know about the feature nor how to get to it.

    

    Edge makes the feature available and provides a short cut command to
    toggle it on and off, f9.

    

    It comes up on some web sites and not on others because the browser
    itself determines when it is appropriate to offer it.

    

    There are pages without articles where it should not be offered.  If
    you are on a shopping site or the home page of a newspaper, it
    shouldn't be available.  One of its purposes is to remove extraneous
    material from articles.  Web pages without articles would be
    rendered useless if the same kind of material were removed.

    

    As you will see from this interesting page, Immersive reader wasn't
    developed as a blindness accessibility tool, at least in the case of
    Edge.  Blind people may benefit from it but look at all the features
    offered, most of them visual.

    GeneWhen I hear this message, it's not always an ad; somehow NVDA just thinks it is.  I thought there would be something in NVDA to turn off?  One of the first responses did mention a switch in one of those NVDA menus; but I don't remember.  I'll have to go back in my mail and find it again.

<HT> ""--

You will only be able to access the site if you remove or turn it off, then a link to how to do this in the popular browsers.
The problem is, that I have little issue with adverts, if they are built with access in mind. Its no good having an accessible site, then allowing any tom dick or Harry to  put inline advertising in that breaks the site for access. Maybe those writing advertising content need to get educated as well as web designers.

Thanks.Immersive reader has nothing to do with using browse mode.  It is a
    way in which the browser presents the text, removing extraneous
    material.  All browse commands and browser commands work, including
    copy and paste.

list of all table commands 8 messages,"Hi all.In the what's new document for nvda 2022.2, I see that there are some new table commands.
I don't work with tables often, so I wanted to find a list of all the table navigation commands so I can see what was already there and what was added with this release.
I had a look at the user's guide and the quick commands reference, but I didn't find them.
I also tried the input jestures dialogue but I didn't find them either. I had a look at brows mode, document formating, navigating with nvda etc.I don't know where else to look.I only know the alt control with the arrow keys but nothing else.
Where can I find a compleete list of all the table commands?ThanksNikosHi,

Current (and new) table navigation commands are:


Control+Alt+arrows: move between columns and rows
Control+Alt+Home/End: move to the first or the last column on the same row
Control+Alt+Page up/page down: move to the first or the last row on the selected column


Thought these were added to the user guide, but looks like it wasn't (Quentin, any thoughts?).

Cheers,

JosephHi again.I am very soory I found it under section 5.3. Navigating with the System Caret.
NikosMany thanks Joseph.It was my mistake there are under 5.3. Navigating with the System CaretNikosNikos,
Yes you found the original commands - but Joseph raises a good point, the new ones should be there as well. 
Looking at the PR which resolved this - https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/pull/13435/files#diff-5290814766111d44cf9670be8301f5af9457dba7a8f936dbbbf207883000a4b0
There is a change entry for the user guide which should add four new rows to that table in 5.3 with the commands to move to first and last column and row.
Ah - if you look at your local copy (if you've updated to 2022.2) then it's in there, but the file at https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html still seems to be the 2022.1 User Guide - We'll get that updated!

looking for an NVDA trainer in Columbus Georgia 6 messages,"I have someone who is looking for someone to train her in NVDA who lives in Columbus, GA. She would prefer in-person training but may be willing to do it over the phone—you would have to ask her. She is willing to pay the person.

BetsyWhat training does the person want?  Does she want Windows training
    or does she already know how to do what she wants to do using
    another screen-reader and only wants to know how to do the same
    things with NVDA?

-
As someone who does this sort of tutoring on a regular basis, I cannot begin to say how important the answer to this and the additional question Gene posed is.

Even if the person has never touched a screen reader, if they are already a skilled computer user by sight (or were when they had sight), it's an entirely different ball game than it is when someone is starting from ground zero.

My most recent client is a gentleman in his mid-40s who never touched a computer before, and who still has enough vision to use ZoomText at the moment.  But the challenge of getting him to understand all the computer basics is a far bigger challenge than dealing with ZoomText is, but ZoomText still adds to the overall challenge because you are only seeing part of the entire screen enlarged.  But my central point here is it's really important to know what the scope of training is before one agrees to undertake it.

    realize that most of what she does will likely be the same or very

Nope.  And given what's been mentioned here, neither does/do whoever was once the maintainer(s).

If you were to be trying to keep that up to date and comprehensive, it is certain to become unmanageable over time for a software package like NVDA. 

Myself, I'd ditch it.  And that's not because donations are not appreciated, either.  But the majority of donations I've made during my life had no formal acknowledgement.  For myself, I'd rather every penny be directed toward its intended purpose.

As did I, up until this post made it crystal clear what that file is.  A name change to CodeContributors.txt might be in order if it is to be maintained.

Those 4 additional characters would make a world of difference.

mozilla thunderbird enhancements addon 3 messages,"So when the thunderbird enhancement addon is updated will we then be able to use first letter navigation in the address bbooks?I have not seen anything that suggests this is the case.  I've never even seen a request for such on the developer's GitHub issues page for Mozilla Apps Enhancements.

The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.
        ~ Dorothy NevillNeither the Thunderbird add-on you can get from Mozilla nor the
    Mozilla apps enhancement add-on for NVDA has anything to do with
    first letter navigation in the address book.  You could use first
    letter navigation in the address book previously because it was a
    standard list.  The list itself no longer supports first letter
    navigation.  You must search for an address using the search field
    you are placed in when you open the address book, then tab to the
    list to see the results.  It works like a filter and shows relevant
    results.

    

    I never use the address book in Thunderbird except to add or remove
    addresses.  Autocomplete is much more efficient to use when finding
    an address to use in composing a message and that is true of the
    current version and of previous versions.

my arrow keys stopped working in whatsapp web using firefox or chrome. 2 messages,"Hello folks,

My arrow keys stopped working when trying to navigate messages in whatsapp web using firefox or chrome. I can

t read a message word by word or letter by letter, or line by line. Neither left or right arrows, or up and down arrows work inside a message. Now using NVDA 2022.1 on windows ten latest update. Where is the nvda setting that can control this? I can't think that I made any changes to the NVDA settings, unless I made a change inadvertently.

Any ideas?

Cheers,

IbrahimOn another group I saw some comments about problems in the latest on line version of the interface. It may well be that they themselves have broken it.
I wonder if a different browser might work. I think its not so much arrow keys as the message list that is the problem. I gave up on them some time ago. They kept on changing it and even on the phone strange things happen for no apparent reason.  Might be one to take to the chat sub group, unless somebody has a bright idea.

netflix problem 3 messages,"hi:


last night i turned off my computer without shutting down first. this morning when i fired up netflix to watch a movie i found the sound was muted.  when i tab to the volume and hit enter it says muted and i can't get it unmuted.  it is obvious that enter won't change the issue.  so can anyone tell me what key to hit to unmute netflix?  thanks.


stewHow did you shut down the computer?  If you pressed but didn't hold
    the off switch for an extended time, perhaps ten seconds, you did
    properly shut down the computer.  Pressing and releasing the power
    switch by default causes a proper shut down to occur.  

    

    It is important to know about that use of the power button because
    at times, the keyboard may stop functioning and pressing and
    releasing the power button after holding it for perhaps half a
    second is a way you can cause a proper shutdown in that case.

    

    If the probglem is other than the keyboard not functioning, such as
    the computer freezing, there may be no way to cause a proper
    shutdown.  At this point, we don't know if you did cause an improper
    shutdown.  

    

    Others will comment on your mute question specifically regarding
    Netflicks, (spelling) but I'll make the following comments,
    applicable for all standard web pages with audio controls:

    

    Volume is not mute.  There should be a button that says unmute when
    sound is muted and mute when sound isn't muted.  Use the space bar
    on buttons.  Tab around and look for an applicable button.  

    

    GeneStew,

We know you've solved this, but it would be really nice if you would post exactly how.

Even solutions that are silly simple aren't necessarily immediately obvious.  Posting, ""I solved it,"" without the how, well . . .

Is one of your add-ons Add-On Updater?  If so, once (or if) versions of those add-ons compatible with NVDA version 2022.1 become available they should be picked up by Add-On Updater and you'll be prompted to install them.

In the meantime, you either deal without or do the manifest file update workaround and hope that will work for a given add-on.

Apparently the final I-s were being dotted and T-s were being crossed to have Add-On Updater distribute the NVDA 2022.1 compatible version of this add-on and that's now complete.  It should recognize the need to update at this point and trigger said updating.

This can be handled by a dictionary entry using a regular expression (or, perhaps, several) if you are able to clearly define the format you consider to be ""a phone number.""   Since this varies somewhat by locale, it's important to know the formats you would want read as chunks of individual digits, and that would include punctuation.

As two examples for the USA:  (540) 571-6820    or 540-571-6820  would be typical phone number formats.

The add-on mentioned does not seem to be specific enough in attending to formatting cues.

The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.
        ~ Dorothy NevillI see so many formats of telephone numbers in documents these days, it can be most wearing to figure them out. Some also complicate them by adding +44 and losing the leading 0, and to cater for all the various hyphens and colons that folk use, it seems a real pain.

nvda and password fields 7 messages,"Dear nvda users,
 
I’m asking on behalf of a friend who is beginner in using nvda.
 
Can someone tell me where I can turn off the nvda feature of saying asterisk in the password prompts? My friend prefers to hear what she is typing in the password prompt.

Marsa
MRS 9064, MaltaHello,
As this is quite a security risk, I suggest, instead, either turning off character echo if she already knows how to type, or leaving it as is.
The longer answer is that some password fields on some sites will have a box to show the password as it is being typed. This could be an option where it exists. But again, I really recommend your friend simply gets used to typing in passwords without the character feedback. In fact, I recommend most people disable character echo altogether, and either opt for no typing echo, or at least Word echo. The extra chatter simply isn't needed if the individual feels comfortable typing.
Thanks. ""--

in the display name field.That’s not a good idea to have any screen reader such as NVA announcing  letters of a password being said. Especially on a public computer.  You don’t know if anyone can see what she’s typing. They can  hear it to. If you are alone at home then its  okay to have your  password being said.  Your  friend is asking  for trouble if she’s using a public computer.     Sent from Mail for WindowsI will be the next person who discourages, strongly discourages, ever having one's passwords echoed while being entered.  When there was once talk of this becoming a setting I railed against it.

If either memory, typing, or both are an issue then it is far better to use a password manager that will enter it for you or where you can copy and paste the entire password.

You would need to be a lot more specific about exactly the steps you're taking before anyone could venture a guess about what you're doing wrong.

See the tutorial I wrote:  Using the NVDA Dictionaries with Regular Expression Matching to Change Pronunciations (docx)
 

Even if you're not using a Regular Expression match, the steps are the same except for the radio button you'll choose if you are not doing a regular expression match.

how can the key combination in one of the two add-ons be changed ???
is exactly the same combination.
question 2 in which upgrade the additional lion.
where is to read the subtitles in which upgrade of nvda does not work ???
or operating normally ???
and no problem Thank you.
Finally I would like to ask some extras are in English.
how could i help translate greek language ???

Thanks for everything.Good morning,
WIth your conflicting add-ons, there may be an option in the add-on itself if it creates its own dialog somewhere.  Otherwise, it may have added an entry to NVDA's Input Gestures dialog.  This is where you can add / change / remove any of NVDA's keystrokes and gestures.  We included a walkthrough of adding a keystroke in In-Process awhile back now, but the steps haven't changed: https://www.nvaccess.org/post/in-process-24th-july-2018/#InputGestures
For updating, I think something was lost in translation, but are you asking about NVDA 2022.1?  This is an add-on breaking release, so add-ons will need to be updated to work with it.  The actual updates required shouldn't be too onerous, and most add-ons should be able to be updated such that the new version will work with NVDA 2021.x  and NVDA 2022.x versions.  You will need to check with the add-on authors as to where they are at with that process though.  The page at: https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/nvdacompat.en.html has the status of the official add-ons at least, as well as contact details for add-on authors.

I don't think we have any four state toggles in NVDA; perhaps it was thought to be too cumbersome for a single key.

The more that mark your submission with the thumbs up or down reaction, ,
the more they can consider for a future release and sooner at that. I like
the idea myself, but I'm not sure if that is doable at present.You are talking evidently, about command keys, such as control,
    enter, down arrow, etc.  To change this behavior, open the keyboard
    dialog, control NVDA k, and tab around.

    You will get to speak command keys.  It's a check box.  Press the
    space bar to uncheck it.  

    Press enter and the dialog will close.  The setting is changed and
    if you are using default settings in this respect, when you shut
    down NVDA or close Windows, the setting will be permanently saved.

object out of screen - what does it mean? 7 messages,"Hi friends!

In sansung update, I used object navigation and nvda said: ""ok button out of screen"".

I tried to click it using nvda. But as soon as I do so, the focus goes to desktop.

I am curious to understand hwat is an object out of screen.

I believe this ok button should be visible for the sighted users.Funny you should mention this. Is this  on web sites? I've seen it several times, but its hard to duplicate it, so I wondered if it might be a browser issue. It was in Firefox for me, but its hard to  debug something that happens randomly.

It means that the object, e.g. the button, is not in the limits of the screen.
This may happen for example on the web if you tab to a button and then scroll with the wheel of the mouse. The button has still the focus but it is not visible on the screen anymore.
If an object is out of screen, some action may fail, e.g. route the mouse pointer to the object and try to clic it will fail because the mouse cannot go outside of the limits of the screen.
In Firefox, I think that activating an object with enter triggers a mouse movement in some cases, what may be the reason why it fails for an off-screen object.

For the applications, I think that some objects may be hidden or shown according to the state of the application, e.g. object of the selected tab shown and object of the other tabs hidden. In this case, navigating with object navigation cursor allow you to reach hidden objects, reported as off-screen. 

Cheers,

CyrilleHello Brian!

There are Android ports of KeePass, and they're listed on the bottom of the main KeePass page along with the iOS ports.

I use Password Safe and it's Android port that goes by the name PasswdSafe.  There is an iOS port as well as a Mac port, too.

predicted text and NVDA 4 messages,"Hello,

has anyone any ideas as to how to stop NVDA speaking predicted text as I type into edit fields etc?, I know this is really down to the particular program I am using, but it is most  off puting and I lose  the place in my typing.

The only way I have been able to do something about it is to write what I want in Word and then copy and paste into the field I am using.




Any suggestions will be gratefully received, thank you.

Best Regards, Jim.Is not this the auto complete issue. Some people love it and others hate it. Often on screen you can also get a list come up as you type as well, but on some software, autocomplete can be turned off, but not so much on web sites these days.
I wonder if turning off the detection of new content might help. Not tried it myself, just decided to concentrate harder. I'd be interested in the answer here too.

in the display name field.As far as I know, this is controlled in the individual program.  If
    you don't want to look through various programs settings or research
    the question for individual programs, turning off speech with NVDA
    s, typing what you want, then turning on speech with NVDA s pressed
    twice will cause you not to hear predictive text.

    

    GeneOn thinking about this further, I'll add that if you turn speech off
    so you can't hear what you type, you should be very careful what you
    type into a browser address bar.  These days, it isn't just
    inconvenient to go to a wrong site, it can be dangerous.  Criminals
    buy names very similar to the real name so that if people make
    typographical errors when going to a site, they may go to a
    malicious site and be infected or be directed to do things where
    they reveal personal information.

"profile ""say all"" and how to increase reading spead with synth settings ring 2 messages","Hello,

I've created a say all profile, where I disabled announcement of some elements. it is activated whenever I press ins (nvda) key + down arrow. and here is my problem.
sometimes I want to increase reading speed via syinth settings ring (ctrl+ins+arrow keys), but it does not work for desired profile but on a default profile or profile linked with currently focused application.
so what should I do to manage say all profile on the fly. it is very frustrating to go to profile dialog and manually activate say all profile to change this setting and then deactivate it to use other profiles again.
I ask it, due to it worked in NVDA versions before 2019.3.
If there is no solution, should I open a github issue?
and has anyone a same problem?
so here are str to clarify, wha I am talking about:
- obviously, create say all profile
- open document, which you want to read.
- press say all command.
- try to increase/decrease reading speed via synth settings ring

current behaviour:
reading speed is changed on a default profile or on a profile linked to focused application.

expected behaviour: reading speed should be changed on say all profile.

I know it is understandable, that when reading stops, NVDA falls back to previously active profile. but anyway is there any solution, how to bring back changing synth parameters via ring to a say all profile again on the fly?
one solution would be a short delay before NVDA falls back to previous profile when synth ring was used. it means, if ring was used in five seconds after reading was stopped, then this would apply to say all profile. interval could be also shorter, but...
I ask it because JAWS have simular function to increase/decrease reading speed durin say all on the fly and it is very useful.

thanks.
best regards,
JožefHello

Would you like to change only speech speed on the fly as in Jaws? Or would you like to be able to change more parameters?
If you want to change only speech speed, there is already a GitHub issue for it. You may comment there.
If you want something more complete, you may open a new ticket.

In the meantime, you can add a gesture to enable and disable the sayAll profile; this is already quicker than opening the profile dialog to make some modifications.

question regarding voices 2 messages,"Hi, I notice that there is vocalizer from code factory and from nuance an was curious what the difference was between the 2? Are they the same thing? 
Also, is there somewhere I can hear what the elequance voices sounf like?
Lastely, if one purchases a licens for vocalizer, does that license work forever with updates to future versions of NVDA?
Sorry if these are dumb questions, but I could not find info on this...
Thank youHello!
    

    
    First of all, Vocalizer voices are property of Cerence, Inc., a
      company founded by Nuance, wich is the prior owner of Vocalizer
      voices...
    

    
    Tiflotecnia first, and later CodeFactory, made a contract with
      Nuance to sell their voices to NVDA users.
    To force the utilization only with NVDA were created NVDA
      add-ons.
    

    
    When you buy a license from one of the companies, it will be only
      valid for the product of that company...
    There are any license allowing the use of voices from both
      companies...

reducing the frequency of progress updates 9 messages,"Hi all,
I have changed my NVDA progress indicator from beep to speak, but am
wondering if there is a way to refine the way progress is announced.
Is there some way I can only have as many indicators announced as NVDA
can read without getting behind? For example, I just sent a file to
someone using We Transfer. As the file was uploading, NVDA would say
1% transferring, 2% transferring, 3% transferring, and on and on. If I
hit the control key at that point, it would continue to speak, but say
8% transferring, 9% transferring, etc. Is there a way for NVDA to only
give as many progress indicator outputs as it can comfortably speak?
Thanks,
BobBob Cavanaugh wrote:

Is there a way for NVDA to only give as many progress indicator outputs as it can comfortably speak?NVDA doesn't know what it can comfortably speak, because it doesn't know how long the progress bar is.

I think one of two things could be done.

1. If we were to make progress bar announcements interruptible, NVDA could cancel the speech of the current percentage, and replace it with a new percentage when the bar is recalculated.  However, in the situation you described, I think what you would end up with is a bunch of partially started speech fragments that never complete. It may never be able to finish speaking a full digit, just a bunch of stuttering gibberish until the bar either bogs down, or completes.

Is that an acceptable outcome? I suspect not.

2. Alternatively, NVDA could try to monitor the speed at which the bar is progressing, and assume that in the future, it will continue at that rate. It would then have to adapt its granularity to the speed of the bar. In other words, if it's taking fifteen minutes, then announcing single percentages would be fine. But if it's taking 15 seconds, only announcing 20%, 50%, and maybe 80%, would be sufficient.

That would require rather a bit of computational guesswork, and coverage for cases where the bar suddenly changed speed as they often do, but I can imagine how to pull it off. I couldn't find anyone asking for this on GitHub.

If one of those is what you want, I suggest you put in a feature request.

3. Well okay there is one more thing: one of NVDA's undocumented settings can help you here, if you don't mind ini file twiddling. Take a look at Brian Gaff's comment in the below.
Https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/5031

LukeThis would be accurate if it was a real progress bar. I suspect it's a live region.
The default percentage for speak is 10%, and it doesn't say transferring at the end.

However, I couldn't reproduce this. I went to WeTransfer and selected a file, but uploading gave me no automatic progress bar in Chrome.I use Firefox, so that may be the difference. The other instance I
notice this in Firefox is when downloading a file. Now that Firefox
opens the downloads panel, it says downloading the filename, progress,
and time remaining. Currently, NVDA seems to update the progress every
tenth of a megabyte, but if I hit control, it jumps forward quite a
bit. It seems like in both instances, NVDA holds the progress
indicator in its speech buffer, and announces it as often as it can. I
wonder if there's a way we can get it to not do that, and only
announce progress as close to live as it can?On Jun 27, Tyler Spivey via groups.io wrote:

This would be accurate if it was a real progress bar. I suspect it's a live region.Ah, good catch. I clearly wasn't thinking.

LukeThis same issue exists in command prompt of course, where the process finishes almost  instantly but the reading goes on for an age.
I've not found any way to control either problem.
I have one web page where there are progress bars for file and total upload so the bleeping can sound most odd as can the reading. I've yet to find a way to say only read this progress bar, but not this one etc, I guess in the command prompt you can output to a text file, but not every dos based program will respect that choice either!

in the display name field.Hi,

Actually, it is not NVDA that holds progress bar values - it says things according to what Firefox (or any app) tells it to say, more so if this is a live region (for live regions, provided that the application developer or website author is informing screen readers that live text should be announced).

Cheers,

JosephNot that I should be saying this,
but I thought ""live regions"" could either be ""aggressive"" or ""assertive"".

Jason BratcherThere are, I believe, three levels that live regions can be set to
    by those who place them somewhere such as on a web page.  One of the
    settings, as I recall, interrupts other speech when it is in
    progress and I believe the other two don't, though I don't know
    details about the other settings.

"repeat for the dufus, please? 5 messages","How do I get the NVDA to not say paragraph block, or whatever that is. I did it the other day; then it disappeared and we're back to it. But I have searched the help as much as I can, and I cannot find that part where we get to send our preferences to the program.

I even went back into the trash to find the email; but I just cannot find it.

I'll try to be more diligent in the future. Or someone will have me writing the command 500 times on the blackboard.

Seven more days of school.Hi,

I believe you can turn off report paragraph indentation in the document formatting settings dialogue. Ctrl+NVDA+D

Hope this helps.You may have inadvertently undone the change.   Do the following to
    change the setting and then the following to make sure the setting
    is permanently saved.

    Open document formatting with control NVDA d.

    Tab to block quote, which is a check box and uncheck it with the
    space bar.

    Press enter.  The dialog will close and the change will be made.

    Then permanently save the change with control NVDA key c.

    

    NVDA is set by default to permanently save changes when the program
    closes or you close it in some way.  That includes if you shut down
    or reboot while NVDA is running.

    but you can permanently save a setting manually with the command I
    gave, control NVDA key c.

    

    There is a command to revert to the saved configuration, control 
    NVDA r.  If you issue that command and a setting isn't permanently
    saved, it will go back to what it was before.

    My guess is that you inadvertently issued that command.

scheduling a recurring Zoom meeting with NVDA 18 messages,"Hi all,
Does anyone know how to schedule a recurring Zoom meeting using NVDA?
I can check the box that says that the meeting is a recurring meeting,
but then Zoom says ""this is a recurring meeting, meet anytime."" I'm
looking for a solution where I can keep the same meeting link every
month, but also have the meeting date and time show up in the invite.
I know this can be done, as a friend of mine runs a meeting at the
same time on the first Saturday of the month, and the invite shows a
series of dates. She has some vision and also has JAWS installed, so
can't help me all that much. Apparently, after checking the recurring
meeting box in JAWS, a time picker shows up. Does anyone have any
experience with this in NVDA?
Thanks,
BobNot sure if this is much help, but I've done this before by using the zoom-> google calendar integration. It's possible to configure events (meetings) the same way you do any other event if you link Google Calendar with your zoom account. I think it's also possible by linking Outlook as well.I remember doing this via the zoom app itself, but that was in 2020 when I organized a reading group for my local neighborhood for the children. I would have to look back at how I did this.Please do look into that Sara.Hello Bob and all,
You have two ways of scheduling a zoom meeting.
Either you use the zoom desktop application or you use the web interface.
1. With the zoom app
You will be able to scheduling a recurring meeting but not how often it will happen.
1. In the first tab of zoom, tab until you hear something like schedule a new meeting.
2. Hit enter.
3. You will have to type the meeting subject. NVDA does not always speak what you type. So you should use tab and shift+tab to update what NVDA pronounces. May be you should select what is proposed by default, by typing ctrl+a, and write your own subject.
4. When you tab, you can choose the meeting date. By default, Zoom displays today's date and time. Tab to reach the month. NVDA announces, ""month and something like rotating button"". Use up and down arrows in order to be sure that the month you want is selected.
5. Use tab again and choose the day you want with up and down arrows. 
6. When you tab again, you can select the year. 
7. When tabbing again you can reach the time you wish. Note that the first zone is the actual time, you cannot modify it. Tab again and you will hear the hours and with another tab, the minutes. You still can use up and down arrows to select hours and minutes. NVDA should speak what you are modifying with up and down arrows. 
8. When tabbing again, you can select how long the meeting should last. One hour, for example. You still can modify this with up and down arrows. NVDA does not always update what is changing so that you should use tab and shift+tab to be sure you have selected the right length. 
9. Tab again until you hear recurring meeting, checkbox unchecked. Check it with the space bar. 
You will hear an alert that you should ensure that your calendar can schedule such a meeting. Mine is linked to Outlook but you can also link to google or any other calendar. 
In my case, Outlook asked me to confirm the meeting and I can choose if the meeting should occur every week, or month. 
2. When using zoom in a browser
When you connect to Zoom, you can look for the meetings' tab and look for your next meeting.
You also have a link to schedule a new meeting.
If you have saved it in the zoom app, you will find this meeting on the zoom page.
You will have a heading 3 with a link to start the meeting.
You can then read the subject of the meeting then the time.
Under this you can read something like recurring. 
After that you have ""add to"" and links to Google agenda, Outlook calendar .ics, or yahoo calendar.
When you click on google, for example, a new window will open asking you to connect to your Google account. 
Google asks to confirm that you accept that zoom shares this information with google. 
Select ""continue"". 
You will then find a form with your meeting, you can select the time, the length and then you have a drop down list where you can choose if the meeting should occur once, every day, every week, every month, every year....
Then you can select who you want to invite to this meeting. What the invited people may do (modify meeting, invite others ....) 
You can choose when sending the notification and how (by e-mail for example) 
Then you have to go back to find the button save and you have your meeting.
I hope this can help.
Otherwise do not hesitate to ask.

SylvieSo, there's no way to do it within Zoom itself, the scheduling has to
be done with your calendar of choice? I'll try the web interface, as
in the invite that my friend sends, there is usually a link to a
calendar invite, which I've never seen before.I should say, never seen in my own meetings before.Yep they are sure there.  I had a calendar invite when I had the free account option a while ago, maybe that has changed now?Typically, what I will do is schedule the meeting, but when Outlook
opens my calendar, I just close it without saving that invite. If the
meeting is only one time, the date and time will be in the text of the
invite, but from what you guys are telling me and what I've seen, that
may only be the case if Zoom is authenticated with Google Calendar.
I'll have to play around with Zoom a bit more and see if I can see
upcoming one time meetings scheduled for future dates, and if that is
the case, I'll have to call her and see if she sees the meeting in
question when she opens Zoom. I'll report back either later today or
tomorrow.The following is from my friend with my comments. She is running JAWS
and this is what she sees as she tabs through the schedule meeting
dialog. Perhaps does a ticket need to be put in for this?
Meeting Title
Add description link I usually tab past, NVDA doesn't even see this
Choose date
Select start time
Select start time unit
Select duration hours minutes
Select time zone, again NVDA completely skips over
Recurring check box
Select recurrence type radio button
      first option a specified interval
       Second option something like On and then combo boxes for
first..last and then for day of the week. NVDA sees none of this.
end date another Radio button either specify a date or after combo box
occurrences again NVDA doesn't see this
registration required checkbox, again not shown by NVDA. After that is
meeting ID and security options, which NVDA reads fine.Bob, have you tried the Zoom Enhancements add-on, and does it have an effect on this? Sorry if that was already answered.

What you described does seem buggish to me, especially with the Jaws results you've demonstrated.

LukeOdd, I remember seeing this, but at the time I Had a paid account.  Maybe that's the difference? 
Update: I see all of that, so maybe something corrupted in your zoom or copy of nvda. Run the reg tool in nvda and see if that helps. I even see ""schedule from outlook"" and ""schedule from google. Also go to your profile in zoom and check for updates. 

Good luck.Luke, to answer your question, my friend and I were talking about this
and I brought it up. I downloaded and installed the addon, while
waiting for her to send me what she saw with JAWS, and it didn't make
any difference.
Sarah, so you're saying you saw all of what JAWS shows within Zoom
using NVDA? I've never seen it, whether on a free or paid account,
across two computers. I do see the radio buttons that ask what
calendar I wish to use, and I presume that if I didn't discard the
invite once Outlook opened, I'd be able to schedule it as a recurring
meeting with the parameters I want, but that only adds it to my
Outlook calendar. If I use the mobile app on my phone, something
similar happens, as the dates I want are added to my phone's calendar,
but Zoom still shows as a recurring meeting meeting anytime. With this
setup, the meeting invite that is copied to the clipboard and is what
I usually send out doesn't show any date or time information, which
basically puts me in the same situation I'm in now where I have to
remember to add the date and time information in manually.No, I'm seeing all of the fields as described, at least for now, until something changes. Did you check for updates  in zoom itself as it will not auto update.I've gotten auto updates from Zoom, I got one about three weeks ago.
I'll try com registration fix as well, maybe that will help. I've
never used that before. One other oddity, I tried the same thing using
Narrator and it didn't see the mentioned fields either, acted the same
as NVDA.Update, Com registration fix didn't help at all.Sarah,
You said you could see all the fields in Zoom with NVDA. What does
Zoom give you for calendar options? It gives me Outlook, Google, and
Other, but even on other it won't allow me to choose the time. My
friend said she set hers up directly with her Google account, and she
isn't even asked about which calendar she wants to use.I'm not actually sure. I can schedule it with google and the last time I tried, I could choose a time.  This now looks to be the same.",1706,24,0.014067995,0.014067995,1,1706,33.56,34.06,83.32,38.95,16.56,14.24,87.98,68.7,57.44,16.06,9.73,4.51,0,4.28,0.82,0.06,6.33,14.95,7.15,1.7,11.84,9.79,5.33,8.5,1.47,18.23,3.22,3.99,1.11,0.35,0.53,0.23,15.71,1.35,14.36,2.87,1.64,2.93,4.04,0.29,4.92,0.18,1.52,1.41,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0,0,11.72,6.04,1.23,0.23,0,0.06,4.45,5.57,0,0,0.82,0.06,1.52,0.06,0,1.47,5.45,0.06,0.12,5.1,0.47,0.06,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.82,0.53,0.18,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.41,6.62,7.8,0.88,0.82,4.34,2.11,0.23,0,9.73,3.17,5.51,2.75,0.06,0.06,0.06,0,0,16.41,6.86,5.51,0.53,0,2.05,1.47
screen curtain and saving battery 18 messages,"Hi all. In my previous laptops there was the option to turn off the display by pressing a key combination. But, with my new laptop which is from the Dell brand this option is not available unfortunately. I want to know about the screen curtain feature in NVDA does enabling it saves battery or it is only meant  for privacy purposes? also, does anyone knows of a way to have the screen really turned off, i mean to have an option similar to what is present in many laptops 
I am interested in turning off the display to make the battery last longer.
Thank youhi. what is your previous laptop cpu generation?
if i am correct, the laptops which support vga displays, we can turn
off the screen. ""--

imam ali""Whether you can turn off the screen or not, you can dim the screen
    to a point where, I would think, little power would be used and the
    screen being on would have a negligible effect on running time per
    charge.

    

    GeneZahra my old laptop was with a 4th generation CPU but i think until
now many laptop brands still include a keyboard shortcut to turn off
the screen but unfortunately my Dell is not having this keyboard
shortcut.
Gene i think that depends on the brightness level you are allowed to
reach on the laptop. I set the brightness to 0% but according to
sighted help the screen is still viewable. I don't have any experience
about this but i remember someone had posted a way to add a keyboard
shortcut to NVDA to turn off the touch pad and it is working perfectly
well on my device that is also lacking a shortcut to enable this
option I hope that there is a possibility to do that to the display as
well.
and back to my original question: how does screen curtain in NVDA work?
thank youWhere did the sighted person look at the screen?  Was it dark in the
    room or was there light from other sources?  Others may comment but
    I would think that if you set the brightness as low as you can,
    little or very little battery power would be used by the small
    amount of light shown.  

    

    GeneScreen curtain turns off the actual display part of the screen (as in it does go completely black) but it does NOT turn off the backlighting.  That definitely saves some power, but not as much as could be if the backlighting were turned off, too.

I'm going to ask on another technical forum I haunt whether it's possible to disable/enable the display entirely via batch scripts or PowerShell files that are ""short and sweet.""

    ~ Herman Melville (1819 - 1891), US novelist & sailorWasn't going to join in here since it's not necessarily
      NVDA-related, but, if you hit windows key + P on machines from, I
      think, windows 7 upwards, and then select second screen only, as
      if you were opting to use only a secondary video card, even if you
      don't have one in place, it might in fact turn off primary display
      as such.
    

    
    As in, this used to work, but, the only real risk is that if
      something goes wrong, not sure you can undo this too easily - as
      in, if something else on your PC crashed, you might then need to
      boot into safe mode to undo the tweak.

      ""...resistance is futile...but, acceptance is versatile...""Jacob,

That doesn't work anymore, at least since Windows 10 and possibly Windows 8.1.  That's the reason devices like the HDMI dummy monitor dongle came into existence.

If Windows does not detect a second display, and you attempt to use it only, it will automatically switch back to the primary display.  I have to believe this decision was made because so often people would, somehow, redirect output to a non-existent second display and have a complete meltdown when they lost the one and only display they always expected to be there.

    ~ Herman Melville (1819 - 1891), US novelist & sailorOk, Brian, thanks for clearing that up.
    

    
    Honestly, the only reason knew about this in the first place was
      since before NVDA offered a screen curtain, this was a form of
      workaround in terms of privacy from sighted folks around you.
    

    
    And, actually, while have a couple of the HDMI dummy dongles
      lying around - for other implementations with other forms of PC's
      that don't run windows, hadn't even thought about this - will
      archive it in my memory.

      ""...resistance is futile...but, acceptance is versatile...""thank you very much Brian i really appreciate it. Honestly this is not
important for me to the point that i spend money on solving it. in
fact the reply on the suggestion is exactly what i want a software
solution that can disable and enable the screen like what is the case
with the laptops containing the keyboard shortcut where when you do
the same shortcut things are normal again or when you do a restart.
Btw just a curious question: what was the way used to add the touchpad
toggle to NVDA i am unable to know what is exactly done. I am sorry i
know  those  2 things are not really that related.Something here might help:

https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-quickest-ways-turn-computer-screen-windows/

Apparently this is something Dell users have been griping about since at least 2011, if the forums are any indication.

One thing you can probably do, is reduce your ""turn off the display"" timer to one minute when on battery. At the least that will turn the screen off when you're not actively pushing buttons.

LukeHi, I don't think     NVDA  natively supports the toggling of the
      touchpad. However, you can use the Input Lock addon, which can be
      found at: 

    
     https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/inputLock.en.html
    I'm not sure if the addon is supported on the latest version of
      NVDA.
    

    
    Some laptops and notebook computers have keyboard shortcuts to
      toggle the touchpad. The laptop that I use is a Lenovo Ideapad
      330, which has the keyboard shortcut fns(the function key)+ f6 to
      toggle the touchpad, however the touchpad turns back on, as soon
      as I reboot/boot the computer.
    You could find the keyboard shortcut in the user manual, or you
      could ask someone to find the key with the touchpad icon on the
      keyboard.
    Hope that helps

      Friedrich
        NietzscheAccording to https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/nvdacompat.en.html the Input Lock add-on has been updated for NVDA 2022.1 and the latest version should be available from the link previously given.
Windows doesn't offer a general keystroke or function to enable / disable the trackpad - if available, that is generally a function of the driver / laptop.  Similarly to pick up on a point from earlier in the thread, Windows doesn't offer a way for NVDA to turn off the laptop screen, so we have worked around it in the best way we could.  Screen Curtain does what it says on the tin in terms of blacking the screen for privacy, however it is not as effective at battery conservation as completely turning the screen off would be - although effectively displaying all black IS more efficient than say displaying all white would be, so if anything it might help a little.

in the display name field.Oh my current desktop is very annoying - I need to have the screen on and powered up or the PC won't turn on - it gives a BIOS error and just beeps at me until I turn it on and then back on again (with a monitor running).  When I turn my PC off, the screen will go to sleep, ready to wake back up when it gets a signal again - but when I turn the PC on, it checks for a signal from the monitor before the monitor has a chance to wake up.  So I have to turn the monitor off, then turn the monitor on, then immediately turn the PC on so it checks for a signal while the monitor is on.

        ~ Dorothy NevillHave you compared performance with the last version or a previous
    version?  You can run it as a portable version.  there are all sorts
    of things that may cause sluggishness and we don't know if this is
    an NVDA problem.  

    

    Is the computer sluggish with Narrator?  Sometimes, something
    happens by coincidence and has nothing to do what what may seem to
    be the problem.  For example, you may install or upgrade NVDA and
    then find the computer is sluggish.  This needs to be checked in
    ways  I've suggested earlier, comparing performance with Narrator
    and/or with an earlier version of NVDA.

    

    Gene1. what version of nvda. Latest doesn't help.
2. what version of windows. You didn't say
3. what are your computer's specks? You didn't say
4. what steps did you take to troubleshoot? You didn't say.

We need to know all of this  before we answer questions, this way we can
eliminate stuff, or you can.

"typing the letter ""I"" makes NVDA glitch 13 messages","This only started recently, but every time I write something that includes the letter I by itself, like saying, “I went to the store,” typing it and pressing space starts a glitch that lasts a long time. It then types the letter again multiple times by itself and starts deleting and typing it again quickly, and if you type something else after that, it screws up those words too and jumbles up all the letters until it eventually stops and leaves you with a screwed up sentence. (Right now  I will mostly write in second person and use the word you instead of talking in first person for obvious reasons.) The glitch of deleting and typing the same letter can last forever if you don’t start typing something else to interrupt it, which, again, it will still screw up. If you turn NVDA off, the keyboard returns to normal and you can write that letter without glitches.
I can barely type on  this  computer because of this. I’ve also tried restarting my computer and deleting NVDA and redownloading it. Does anyone else have this problem? Or any suggestions for how to fix it?I will never say never, but this kind of error is not likely to reside with NVDA.  It sounds like a classic keyboard stuck key issue.

The first thing to try is using another keyboard that is known to be behaving normally and see if that rectifies the situation.

        ~ Dorothy NevillI don’t have this issue. What synth are you using, what specks does your computer have? I’ve not seen this problem; also, what software’s are you using to cause the problem? This sounds more like a memory issue, not nvda.I don't know what is causing the problem but I would suggest the
    following for now to deal with it.

    

    It isn't reasonable for you to change how you write in this manner.

    

    Use the installer to create a clean portable version of NVDA.  I
    doubt you will have the same problem using it.  Until the problem is
    solved, use the portable version for most things and the installed
    version for times when the portable copy won't work.  for example, I
    found by experience, that the portable version doesn't work in the
    task manager.  So if I am going to run the task manager, I always
    run the installed version before doing so if I have been using a
    portable version.

    

    You said you uninstalled and reinstalled NVDA.  I don't think your
    installed copy is corrupted.  Your settings and I assume speech
    dictionary files and perhaps other things I don't know about are
    kept when you uninstall the program so you can install it again and
    not lose such information.  It appears that there is something in
    the retained information that is causing the problem.

    

    GeneA few weeks ago when I'd open TB and go to inbox, I would hear unknown. I could not get NVDA to read the mail.  So I tried Narrator to read after I figured out how to use Narrator to read mail, but it was to much of a hassle. So I ran the Com registration tool and it solved my NVDA reading of messages in TB.But the original message says it doesn't occur when NVDA isn't
    used.  

    

    GeneAlso, and whether the problems are related or not, we already know
    that at times, keys like alt, control or the NVDA key itself get
    stuck on.

Which is irrelevant to me, because these issues often ""selectively present"" in early days.

There are standard diagnostic steps, and trying another keyboard is first among those.  If it's not the keyboard, then the behavior will persist.  That's a vital data point.

        ~ Dorothy NevillThis could be the keyboard like Brian said, but I doubt it.
It sounds like you have software running which tries to modify keystrokes (maybe an autocorrect program, AutoHotkey script, or something like that). Check your system tray.
If you need it, try unchecking Handle keys from other applications in NVDA's keyboard settings.On Sun, Jul 10, 2022 at 04:01 PM, Tyler Spivey wrote:

Something that never would have entered my mind, but something that definitely needs to be checked.  I tend to believe that people using these sorts of programs are aware that they are doing so, but any one of us can easily forget, over time, about programs that run in the background quietly doing precisely what we originally wanted them to do, and not have it pop to mind that they might not be doing so now, for whatever reason.

        ~ Dorothy NevillThis sort of thing occurs with a sticky caps lock key I think.
Its even more confusing if its also set as the nvda key. What might be interesting is a short snatch of the debug log for that.
Does it happen in Notepad?

1. What program(s) does this happen in? E.g. Notepad, Word, Outlook, etc. Are there any it doesn't happen in?

2. If you run NVDA with no add-ons running (usually pressing NVDA+Q, then choosing ""Restart with add-ons disabled"", will achieve this), does it still happen?

3. If you run Narrator instead of NVDA, does this still happen?

4. If you move your cursor to where somebody else has written a capital I (such as that one I just typed), select and copy it, and then paste it instead of typing it, does this still happen?

Personally I favor Tyler's hypothesis about what this is, as it seems very unlikely to be within NVDA's built-in potential things that can go wrong, unless there's an add-on involved.

LukeI'd switch keyboards and see if it is some kind of macro which is
      turned on with the afore mentioned <I> because nothing
      inside NVDA as such can learn a given sequence without some kinf
      of add-on.

So how I  can get the eloquence/vocaliser fully compatible with the latest nvda2022.2 version?
 
Kind regardsDid you read this message before you asked this??
Hello!


NVDA 2022.2 is not a add-on breaking compatibility version...

If you mean Vocalizer-Expressive from Tiflotecnia, the last driver is
version 3.1.7 and it is compatible with NVDA 2022.1 and beyond...


The direct link for download is:

using nvda on google doodle polls 15 messages,"Hi all,


I've actually tried this on  my iPhone too, but that's off topic. I have a doodle poll, and I have  tried on firefox and google chrome. And I just don't get it. Are these things suppose to be accessible? I see nowhere to enter my name. And then in the poll itself, its just confusing. There is a referencer to tap once for this and tap twice for that, and since you can'te fill in your name anywhere, what good is it all? Plus it seems like nothing takes, like when I check a checkbox and am not offered any way to fill in who I am or whatever. What am I missing here?

LukeI didn't include an example, because I thought they were all the same, and I didn't want people to accidentally enter things on an unrelated poll. However, here is the poll I was having a problem with:


https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/bWnvBGXaOh yes, they are a mess. My council sends these out and never seems to take any notice of anyone I hit a button on, probably because it never actually takes , although it seems to, it does not.

in the display name field.There is something wrong somewhere, perhaps on your system.  the
    fields are there.  Getting them to work is something else again.  I
    more or less figured out a way, as far as I can tell, which I'll
    describe in another message. 

    

    GeneThis way seems to work.  It may sound involved but it may sound a
    lot more involved than it is.  I hope it works for you.  I did this
    using my Windows 7 machine, Firefox and NVDA.  You can see if it
    works on your system with whatever browsers you want to try.

    

    It appears I figured out how to get the check boxes to check and
    uncheck, but I don't understand why this works and why another thing
    doesn't work.  Try the following:

    Tab around and be on something you want to check.  Turn off browse
    mode.  You will find a button and a check box, both for the same
    thing.  If you use keyboard commands, nothing will happen.  

    You will find that if you are on a check box, using the default
    action command, numpad insert numpad enter, you will hear check if
    the box is unchecked and uncheck if the box is checked.  However, if
    you then look at the state of the check box, you will find it
    unchanged.  

    

    Instead, work with the button associated with the check box, which
    is a shift tab back from the check box.

    Use the same command, numpad insert, numpad enter.  

    Issue the command twice quickly, as though you were double clicking
    a mouse.  Check the check box by tabbing once to it.  This doesn't
    work the first time, at least not usually.  Shift back to the button
    and Issue the double click command again and check.  If that doesn't
    work, issue it a third  time, going back to the button to issue the
    command every time.  This usually works for me after the second or I
    think sometimes the third time I issue the command.

    

    As you tab, after you have checked whatever you want, you will find
    a button that says cannot find a time.  Press the space bar on it
    and a dialog will come up to fill in your name and e-mail address.
    Fill in both fields and tab to the appropriate button.  I don't
    recall what it says but use it to submit the form.

    

    I noticed on one of the fields in this form that when I would double
    click the button, it moved me to a completely different field,
    moving me backward.  but if I kept tabbing back to the right button
    and double clicking it, after a number of times, the check box was
    checked.  

    

    This is such a ramshackle way of doing things because of the odd now
    it works and now it doesn't nature of what is occurring that all I
    can say is these methods or about these methods work when I try them
    on this form.  You may find you need to experiment but I'm not at
    all sure anything else works.  

    

    While this is hardly ideal, it seems to let you do what you want in
    filling out such a form.  I have no idea if you can create one
    successfully.

    

    GeneHere is a correction and another  minor correction.  

    On the button that places me in the wrong field where I said that
    returning to it and repeating the command many times changes the
    state of the check box, that doesn't work.  Do the following
    instead,

    When you are moved to the wrong field, tab back to the actual check 
    box.  Use the numpad insert numpad plus command once on the check
    box.  You will hear check if it is unchecked.  Then shift tab to the
    button and use the double click command, NVDA insert NVDA enter
    issued very quickly the same command you have been using.  That
    works, or it did the two times I tested it.

    

    the minor correction is that at times, issuing what I'm calling the
    double click command only once works with other check boxes.

    

    GeneHere is more information.  I just tried this using the Brave
    browser.  I suspect the results would be the same or similar in any
    Chrome-based browser.  I saw a lot more fields and checking check
    boxes with the space bar works.  But be careful you understand what
    you are checking.  You seem to see different dates and days of the
    week, such as Wednesday, July     13 and check boxes for different
    times.

    

    Evidently, Firefox doesn't see most of the check boxes.  All I can
    say is experiment and it might be a good idea to have a sighted
    person look at the results of what you are doing to see if what
    seems to be happenning is, that is, are you checking the times for
    the date you think you are?

    

    GeneProbably a final word at this time:

    First, when moving with the Brave browser, stay in browse mode and
    down arrow through the form.  

    

    Also, I thought I had figured out how this form might be used, but
    it may be unusable.  There is no can't find a time button and no
    dialog to enter your name and e-mail address.  I didn't press the
    submit button when using the brave browser to see what happens.  You
    can try and maybe you will be asked for the information, which would
    appear to make the form usable.

    

    GeneI just tried the submit button and a dialog comes up asking for my
    name and e-mail address so the form may be usable after all.  But it
    might be a good idea to verify that you are placing information
    where you think you are in terms of check boxes and there are one or
    two check boxes that I don't understand what they do.  Their purpose
    might be more clear to a sighted user.

    

    GeneThe cannot find a time button is to be used if you can't find a time
    that matches your availability.  Don't use it to bring up the submit
    dialog unless you can't find a time.  Use the submit button if you
    can find a time or times.

    

    GeneThanks for the help, Gene. I got sighted help; the whole thing is
      the worst doodle poll I've seen yet. They use to be accessible
      sometimes.

"want to read short lines, not full paragraphs 31 messages","I thought that I used to be able to hit the down arrow and go from line to line in a text.  When I hit the down or up arrow in a document now, I hear an entire paragraph, or definitely something longer than a line of text. I was told to try  control-down-arrow to give me that short line sound,
but it did not work. 

I need a line of text at a time, as I do a lot of proofreading with speech and punctuation on.  I must have done something to change a setting that would go from line to line, but I don't know what I did.

Any help appreciated.

Thanks,
Penny

pengold2@...Control down arrow has been for a long time, the move by paragraph
    command in Windows programs where you move through text.  Your
    advice was completely the opposite of  what is the case.  Just down
    arrow is move by line.

    

    But we don't know what program you are having the problem with.  In
    general, programs like Notepad and Word have a feature called word
    wrap.  If it is off, you might move with the down or up arrow and
    hear a lot of text spoken.  If you tell us which program you are
    using, we can tell you how to turn word wrap on.

    

    It makes the length of lines you move by a certain length no matter
    how long the lines actually are.

I wasAs Gene asked: where is this happening? That makes a huge difference to the answer.

If this is happening in a web browser, or in browse mode in Word: open the NVDA browse mode settings, by pressing NVDA+Ctrl+B. One of the early items is the number of characters on a line.
Try lowering this number, then pressing enter.

That might solve your problem, if the environment is something using browse mode.

Otherwise we come to line wrapping, as Gene talked about.

LukeThis long-line stuff is happening when I am in a note pad.

I can transfer lovely emails over to notepad and the down-arrow then does huge long lines.

I think I reduced the length of the line but it may be that the email application of this is different from  just text reading in notepad.

I'll check it out.

I haven't seen Gene's response.  but I thank you all for any help you can give this old lady user.

PennyTurn on word wrap and the problem will be solved.  Do the following:

    Open the format menu with alt o.

    You are already on word wrap when the menu opens.

    Press the space bar to check it.

    Word wrap doesn't affect the actual document but it causes it to be
    displayed so that new lines begin in the display when the text
    reaches the right side of the screen.  Therefore, the lines you move
    through should be about what you are used to.

If you are doing any kind of professional editing though, Notepad is not your friend.
MS Word would be a far better alternative.

LukeLuke Davis wrote:

Sorry to mislead you.

I use notepad mainly when I specifically don't want word wrap, therefore have never tried to turn it on. So I thought I'll grab it from google rather than powering up a Windows machine to check. Bzzzzt.

LukeYes, Gene, I expect down arrow to run by line; control-down arrow
      to go by paragraph.
    but my documents still read in wide paragraph swaths with my down
      arrow.
    I figured that the control down arrow was the wrong advice, but I
      cited it only to show what had been said.I have pressed alt-o in a lot of places; emails, documents, etc.,
      and no menu comes up.
    I do not hear: format menu.  Gene, I know I'm kind of dense; but
      what am I missing?
    Thanks.
    Blessings,
    PennyI thank you. I have found it. I went over and opened a document. when I hit the alt-V three options were there. the third one down was word-wrap.  and it is now on.  Somehow It must have gotten turned off, for the long-line problem had not always been there.

As to the editing, I can comb out a lot of typing errors and such; I can make a document ready for the close reading of a braille perusal.


I am ever-so-grateful to you.

Do I have to purchase MS Word?  Or is it built in to win 11.

Thanks.Be in Notepad and use alt o.

    

    GeneThanks, Gene.  I have a lot to learn.
    PennyIt appears Notepad has changed in Windows 11.  I don't know how it has changed but in Windows 7 through ten and perhaps earlier, there wasn't a view menu.  My instructions are correct for Windows 10 but now that I know that Notepad has changed in Windows 11, I won't answer questions about it if Windows 11 is being used.

GeneI learned something just now.  I got suspicious when you said a
    different method worked to find word wrap.  I did a Google search
    and found that Notepad has changed in Windows 11 but I don't know
    details.

    

    You may have a lot to learn but I learn new things regularly.

    

    GeneYou need to get the subscription, at least that' is what I would recommend. You get 1tb of one drive storage and more. Discuss that though on the Microsoft office group  for which there is  a link in this group’s archives.   ----I hereby vow to follow the admins creed. Work smarter not harder.

This is an easier way to both contact us, and get to know your fellow listeners.For the record, Notepad in Windows 11 is (at least to me) trivially different than the Notepad we've all known ""forever.""  I just looked on my Windows 11 machine (which is downstairs, so I can't side-by-side compare) but other than the standard ""look and feel"" changes to the Windows 11 UI, I'm not seeing anything obviously different than what's in Windows 10 Notepad.  I don't know when the ""Search with Bing"" item even showed up in the Edit menu, but it's there in Windows 10 and I would be shocked if it were not there in Windows 8.1 and 7, too, as this sort of change tends to be back-ported.

It's possible there may be a new entry or two in the Edit menu, but if there are they've certainly not displaced any of the pre-existing ones or their keyboard shortcuts.

If you know Notepad prior to Windows 11 you still know Notepad in Windows 11 for all practical intents and purposes.

The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.
        ~ Dorothy NevillThis article, written when Notepad for Windows 11 was still under
    development, gives an idea of the differences.  There are
    differences, such as a view menu in Notepad 11 and no view menu in
    Windows 10.  Also, there is a settings page that wasn't there
    before.  

    

    Since I don't have Notepad for Windows 11, I can't compare it with
    the Windows 10 version in detail, but there are enough changes that
    I can't assume that some things are where they were.

There is a View Menu in WIndows 10.   And the two items it contains - Zoom and Status Bar - are unchanged in Windows 11.

There are no additional menus under Windows 11 nor are there any menu deletions.  I have no reason to report inaccurately.

        ~ Dorothy NevillI see that there is a view menu but it only contains an item to show
    the status line.  I don't know what has been added to the view menu
    in the Windows 11 version but Word wrap is there.  That raises the
    question of whether the format menu is gone and has been
    incorporated into the settings page.

There's also an option in the start menu called Explore NVDA user configuration directory. Typing explore nvda into the search should get you there.

The last way to get there is by assigning a gesture to ""Opens NVDA configuration directory for the current user.""
I wish that was available somewhere in the NVDA menus, because the location and steps are completely different to get there for portable copies.GOT instructions to go to configuration folder and delete remote.ini.
I did so and restarted nvda.
the remote folder still doesn't show up anywhere.

please advise?

larryGo to the addons manager. What does it say for Remote Support?In add-on manager remote add-on is present?

If so, it is activated?


The remote folder is inside the sub-folder addons in the NVDA configurations folder...

why can't I turn on caret browsing? 3 messages,"Hi list this morning I went to Newsline and when I tried to box links with f7 it kept saying turn on. Told it stop asking me this question and said turn it on.  Now I can’t box links for easy navigation.  How do I fix this.   Sent from Mail for WindowsWhy do you want to use caret navigation?  As to why you can't, I
    don't know.  

    

    As for box links, what do you mean?  If you want to bring up a list
    of links, the command is insert, either insert, f7.  Caret
    navigation is just about useless to a blind person because we
    already use screen[-readers that provide a virtual cursor.  Caret
    browsing is intended to furnish something like a virtual cursor for
    sighted users but it almost never has any application to a blind
    user.

    

    GeneMe thinks your NVDA key isn't working properly. This sometimes happens
to me, but more likely in System Access than NVDA. Usually a restart
of the screen reader fixes this. As for how to get the browser to ask
about carrot browsing again, I don't know as usually when that dialog
pops up I just hit escape and try links list again.",201,5,0.024875622,0.024875622,1,200,45.65,14,59.9,10.35,14.29,15,78.5,68.5,53.5,14,7.5,4.5,0.5,2.5,0,0,6.5,10,4.5,1,16.5,6,8.5,7.5,3,18,4.5,0.5,2.5,0.5,1.5,0.5,16,0.5,15.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,4.5,0,4,0,2,0.5,1.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.5,6.5,0,0.5,0,0.5,4.5,3,0,0,0,0,1.5,0,0,1.5,1.5,0,0.5,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,5,5,0,2.5,1.5,1,0,0,6,3.5,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,6,3.5,1,0,2.5,1
windows 10 app esentials add-on 25 messages,"Hi, everyone, I’m now using the mail app because outlook 2013 is no longer working with my gmail account. Where do I get the new version of windows 10 app esentials? I think I might need it for the mail app which I’m now using. I can read some messages in the mail app but not others.

    You should also have this, Add-on Updater.
    https://addons.nvda-project.org/files/get.php?file=nvda3208Hi, Thanks for the new update but I still can’t read some messages in the mail app automatically after hitting enter. I wonder if I need to use narrator to read messages in the mail app now.   Sent from Mail for WindowsYou can read about it and download it here:

    https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/wintenApps.en.html

    

    You can get Outlook 2013 to work with it if you use an application
    specific password from Google.  

    

    Whatever you do, you may want to check to see if messages are being
    deleted from the server when you delete them using Windows Mail.  I
    am not saying my experience is typical or represents others'
    experiences, but using GMail, when I delete a message using Windows
    Mail, it remains on the server, I believe in the inbox.

    

    GeneI'm not saying this to give you a hard time, but I've seen you be
    really finicky about e-mail programs.  Screen-readers are in complex
    environments with all sorts of possible behaviors to account for. 
    You say messages aren't read automatically.  In almost every e-mail
    program I've used, you need to issue the read to end command after
    opening a message to have messages read as you wish, either without
    a lot of repetition of the subject line first or some other behavior
    or behaviors you don't want.  I therefore use Read to end after
    opening every message in various e-mail programs where it results in
    proper behavior, and I get the behavior I want.  Once you do this
    for a little while, it will  become second nature.  

    

    There are some behaviors of screen-readers that you can't reasonably
    solve and the best thing to do is to adopt this or that action.

    

    GeneIf I open a message and let NVDA do what it wants, I hear reading
    pane grouping repeated twice, and then page 1 spoken.  If I use Read
    to end, I begin to hear reading pane and then I hear page 1 and the
    message begins to be read.  I've eliminated hearing reading pane
    once and most of another announcement of the same thing.  I've
    eliminated enough repetition to amount to something.  Messages are
    read automatically when I use Windows Mail.  I don't know why some
    aren't in your case.  But even if they are, you re still hearing
    needless repetition when you open all messages.

    

    GeneI am going to throw out here that any NVDA user that also uses add-ons would be doing themselves a service to be certain that they have the Add-On Updater add-on as one they've got installed.

Virtually any, ""Where do I get the latest . . . ?,"" questions for all the official add-ons go away when Add-On Updater is in use.  When a newer version of one of the ""official add-ons"" is released, Add-On Updater will detect that and fetch and install it.

If memory serves, the Add-On Updater functionality is eventually supposed to be integrated into the NVDA Core Code, but I am not 100% positive of that recollection nor of any official timeline.  For now, get the Add-On Updater Add-On.

Don't expect this in anything like the near future.
It's one of those ""it'll happen when it happens"" situations.

Add-on Updater, and Windows App Essentials, are still the number one most important add-ons that any user should be running, as practically the first thing you do with NVDA.

LukeHi list! I got my windows ten app to finally work!  I had to get the windows app from the Microsoft store.  I had to read the account. I had to allow it since I’m using gmail.  Usually I get a friend to fix these things for me. But I did it myself! Woo hoo.  I went on google / start page to read how to fix the windows ten app. And I did it! I followed the instructions to the t!  Sent from Mail for WindowsGreat Job, Arleen.Its good that you did those things yourself.  

    

    I don't know what you downloaded and and what problems it solved,
    but if you download the NVDA Windows Essentials add-on from the NVDA
    downloads page, that is nothing but an NVDA add-on and requires no
    permissions, you just install it.

    

    GeneThanks. I even went to the addons page and got the addon for windows ten mail.  For some strange reason the windows ten app became corrupt I could not open it. I had to go to the google site to read my mail. I went to the start menue, I did the applications key to move the app to settings. Then I reset the app and I had to redownload it from the Microsoft store. Then I signed up and put gmail on it. When I had Microsoft word ten witch used outlook it doesn’t work for windows ten. Before I quit using outlook. For some strange reason I had to go to google to allow outlook to use gmail.  Just like rosemary she’s having that same problem. You have to keep allowing it just to do gmail. That’s the same with this windows ten ap. I had to allow it. When I did all this. I used Jaws.  But with getting the addon I used NVDA. This took from Sunday to today. I did lots of reading and I did it slowly so I won’t mess anything up.    Sent from Mail for WindowsSo you are talking about the Windows Mail app itself.  I couldn't
    tell what you had done.

    

    It doesn't sound to me as though Rosemary is having the same
    problem.  Rosemary only said her mail isn't automatically being read
    aloud in all cases, indicating that it is being downloaded but that
    some messages need to be manually read.

    

    Gene, for some strange reason the mail app became badly corrupt.  If this happens to anybody. You go to the start menue, find your mail app. Do not open it. Hold down the shift key and hit f ten.  Arrow to where you will hear any screen reader say more. You’ll see things like uninstall and other things I can’t remember. But hit enter where you hear more. After that. You’ll hear something like unpin from start menue. Move to settings.  You’ll see something like mail on calendar onn etc.  Tab until you see reset.  After that. Go back to settings witch you’d do this by  holding down the windows key. Hit I. Then go to apps and features. If you don’t see the mail app. In that place go to Microsoft store.  In there, type in the search field “mail calendar” Once you see that. Get it. Once that’s done. Go to mail and add your account.  If you use gmail witch I do.  You will be warned that you are allowing windows to get your messages from gmail site you can delete them in the mail app and other stuff.  You have to allow it.  You type in your gmail address and password  and your name. Then once that’s done you’re good to go.  I hope this info is clear. Sent from Mail for WindowsHi All,Just following all the information shared here.Thanks everyone for sharing these useful information.Appreciate if someone could guide me about an update for the ”Translate” Add-on please. Thanks,Ravi.Hi,Just how good this mail app with NVDA? Is it fully accessible? And is it free?I have been using the Outlook ap.Thanks,Ravi.It is accessible, but its a very simple program.  If you do any more
    than things such as send and receive mail, such as use message
    rules, the program isn't able to do them.

MarisaneHi MarisaneYou need to download and install the relevant language pack for Windows 10 which I think is “English United Kingdom” if you’re wanting the George voice. 1.Open “Settings” using Windows+i, and then select Settings  > Time & Language  > Language.  2. Under Preferred languages, select “Add a language”. 3. Under Choose a language to install, select or type the name of the language that you want to download and install, and then select Next. 4. Under Install language features, select the features that you want to use in the language that you selected to download, (this should include associated voices) and then select Install.  Once installed the additional voices should appear in the list of available voices in NVDA. CheersChris Sent from Mail for WindowsHi Chris

Thank you, Chris.

I have got it, but I cannot understand why I do not find English
United Kingdom even after typing in the edit box.

If a voice doesn't show in the list, how does one get it?

Thanking you in advance for your help.
Wally MarisaneWhy not just do it through narrator? 1. Open Narrator Settings by pressing the Windows logo key + Ctrl + N.2. Tab to Personalize Narrator's voice, tab once more to and select Add more voices. ...3. Under Manage voices, select Add voices.4. Select the language you would like to install voices for and select Add.More items...You’ve got UK, U.S., Canada and Ireland you can choose from.Shawn Klein Sent from Mail for WindowsOn Wed, May 25, 2022 at 11:18 AM, Marisane Moruthanyana wrote:

Two things:

1.  Regional variants of a given language are enclosed in parentheses for search purposes, e.g., English (United Kingdom)
2.  If you already have the language pack for a given region installed, that option will be stippled out and inaccessible in the list even if it exists, as you can't install what's already installed.

George has been a part of the English (United Kingdom) language pack for quite a while.  I can find him if I go to the NVDA Settings, Voices, as I use OneCore as my synth of choice, but with Microsoft David.

My only suggestion would be that if you already have the UK English voices installed, and are not finding George, is to uninstall (remove, in the terminology used in the Windows Settings dialog) the existing UK language pack and then add it back again.

You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.
     ~ Ursula LeGuin, The DispossessedThank you. I will try that.Hi            As far as I am aware, each language pack has a set of TTS voices and for a specific voice you need to find out which language pack it belongs to. And download that.  I have 9 different Onecore voices available and have loaded the English United Kingdom, English United States and English Canada language                                         packs to get them. Cheers                Chris  Sent from                             Mail for Windows                From                     : Marisane Moruthanyana

your help again 3 messages,"Good evening gurus

Hopw still well.

I am where all others are.

Another bothering request.

I often se, if I may call it that way, a tray of languages in the win
sys-tray to help me to switch languages.

If it is gone, where has it gone?

How do I bring it back?

Or is there a keyboard command to switch languages?

Please help.

MarisaneThe keyboard shortcut to switch languages is either WINDOWS+SPACEBAR or ALT+SHIFT.
For the notification area icon, I think it is the ""Language bar"" option in Windows settings (press windows, type ""language bar"" and find the system settings screen for it then enter).
I don't switch languages much myself so I'm not as familiar with it as others here likely are.  I'm sure someone will chime in if I'm wrong!

"""application file for JAWS"" and ""JAWS for Windows FS Synth 32 Comm object""","Hi everyone.
Recent queries about volume adjustment got me very curious about something. It’s not a huge problem, but I Would like an answer anyway.
When I go into the volume mixer, I sometimes, but not always, see two entries for jAWS. One says, “application file for JAWS”, which always seems to be there, but the other is not present all of the time (it seems), and says “JAWS for Windows FS Synth 32 Comm object”. If the latter is present, adjusting the volume setting for “Application file for JAWS” does nothing at all, but adjusting volume for “Jaws for Windows fs synth 32 comm object” adjusts speech volume. If fs synth is not there, adjusting “application file for JAWS” adjusts speech volume.
I looked in task manager and I feel like “fs synth32.exe” is always running, but I’m quite sure it doesn’t always have an entry in the volume mixer.
 
Can anyone shed some light on this?
If it makes a difference, and I suspect it might, I am using Eloquence about 85% of the time, and Vocalizer Expressive occasionally.

#modnote: the rules have changed just a bit,"Sorry I have to do this to all of you but the rules have changed. This will make for even cleaner archives which can be searched. I will make this sticky so everyone joining and reading the  website can  make note of the new rules and regulations. You can thank a list mod on a list I'm  a part of for the idea. I just added my own twist shall we say.

Hello and welcome to the Skype English list. Here our goal is to have fun discussing various things related to skype and the screen 

readers such as jaws and others.  Remember the following:


flaming of any kind, virus warnings, spam, or anything off topic will not be tolerated.
Posting in HTML is aloud, but no links will work. The message will hopefully be converted to plain text. Let me know if you see 

any attachments. i doubt you will.
Absolutely no attachments are aloud on this list. Security comes first and this will minimize the chance of viruses spreading.
Keep all intro threads to at least 3  or 4 messages before the thread is taken off list. That way we don't drift off topic. I 

know this is going to be hard for most of us including this mod here but if we keep the  messages on topic the archives will look 

a lot cleaner and people will be able to find info on what they need.
speaking of clean archives absolutely no discussion of anything other than Skype and its use with screen readers will be tolerated on this list.  If the admin notices any other topics such as google talk on this list they will close the thread immediately. I hate to do this but this is to keep the archives easier to find for old members as well as new ones.
When you first join this list it's normally customary to send out an intro message.  Since this list is growing by leaps and bounds this will cease and desist.  The new comer will now  if they want to send out a question regarding the scripts, skype, gw connect, anything that this list covers. any ""hello"" messages and ""I'm new. here is my info"" messages will no longer be tolerated.  We want to keep the searchable archives at the mail archive as clean as possible.
Before you post your question(s) to the list,  please search the group archives or do a google search. This prevents the cycle of repeated messages. It also teaches you the user to search before asking for help. Oly when you have exhausted yoru resources should you come to this list. We get a lot of messages, so the archives are full of stuff dating back to at least 2005.


. Have  fun and happy skyping.

Failure to abide by any of these rules, especially the last one, will get you 3 strikes then the member is band from said list.

Take care all.

2 Part Word Question 9 messages,"Morning all.
 
I have a 2 part question regarding Word 13, Using Jaws 2018 and Windows 10 on a Dell laptop.
 
First, if a word document has multiple tables, and I want to remove them all, is there a way to do this all at once, or do I have to do them one at a time systematically?
Second, what would cause a word document to stop working, and I get the message: Word is not responding, and what would be a remedy? Thanks in advance.
 
JerryI too have seen the same problem ‘not responding’ but I get it with Windows Media player and last night while renaming a file the ‘file not responding’ message came up. As for the Windows Media Player I spent many hours with Microsoft, right up to the top level technician and the problem was never resolved. So I too would like to know if there is a solution to this problem.
 
LarryHi.
 
Regarding your first question, I’m guessing that the method Ann posted the other day will be the most convenient. Cut the entire document and paste it into Notepad, and then re-copy it back to your Word document. Note that you will lose all formatting. In my case, I have my word documents set at my chosen default for line-spacing, etc., so the most I need worry about is italicizing, bolding, etc. Still, there are times when this method is too drastic.
 
That “Word is not responding” message is all too familiar. I have no remedy beyond pressing alt-F4 and then waiting for a new message to appear offering to close the program. I accept and start over. All the more reason to ensure you back up your files and that you regularly save open files.
 How old are your guys's computers? I really see this on super mad old computers. Thanks be on to God I've not seen the not responding thing with word but have with Windows Media Player File exploreo and on a real real old PC even JAWS itself. lol

Subject: [jaws-users] 2 Part Word Question
 
Morning all.
 
I have a 2 part question regarding Word 13, Using Jaws 2018 and Windows 10 on a Dell laptop.
 
First, if a word document has multiple tables, and I want to remove them all, is there a way to do this all at once, or do I have to do them one at a time systematically?
Second, what would cause a word document to stop working, and I get the message: Word is not responding, and what would be a remedy? Thanks in advance.
 
JerryMy computer is about 2-3 years old, it’s an MSI.
 
Larrycheck out the following;

       The impossible is the untried,  Never under estimate the power of a dream.Adrian,
I think you mean copy and paste it.
That is an important distinction that often gets misused.
I think it's a reflection of ""old school"" when we actually did cut and paste.
But for those who don't know, in computer work, they are two different things.
 
GlennOoooo I so want the MSI Trident X my homy. But that's for off list if you wish to shair with me which MSI you have and stuff. Back to the topic at hand if a desktop and even a laptop if 2 yeears oldthat's a little too early for this. Again maybe it's just aging faster. My PCs have don  this at 5. The 1 that  does it most is from 2007 so to be expected I guess. Oh you know what else does this not responding thing now I think of it? Chicken Nugget. It too has done this.Hi, Glenn. Actually, in this case I did mean what I wrote, although I’m glad you’re making sure. If you just copy text, it remains where you had it. If you cut it, you remove it from that place. Here, the idea is to return the original text with unwanted formatting removed. You don’t want to paste a second copy of the same material into the original file.
 
For the record, copy is control-c. cut is control-x.

A Jaws and fire fox question 2 messages,"Hi I have A open drive link and when I am using in fire fox I space on select all and then the page changes to another apart of the page.

I used to have it when I hit the select all button and then I could then hit the down load button and the file would down load.

So what do I need to change to make this happen like it used to?

I don't remember ehat I changed to make this not work correctly like it used to.

A Very Important Question Regarding JAWS Script For Skype Electron,"Respected Doug and others,The matter of fact is that when I have updated to the latest version of Skype electron, my JAWS script for Skype electron revision 121 has stopped working at all.I have contacted with Doug Lee in this regard and He demanded the file called (Confignames.ini) after submitting that file to Him, He said that He cannot do anything at all in this regard because it is the issue of loading the script.Then I checked that script with JAWS 2018 and still not working.Now I’d like to ask a very simple question,If a person wishes to use the latest version of Skype electron which is Skype 8.51.0.72 and if He/She cannot use the latest JAWS for any reason, does it mean that He should say to the script goodbye for ever?I sincerely hope that my question will be answered swiftly.With regards from Inamuddin with the Skype ID:Charlsdarwin1 arguing with a woman is just like reading software’s lisence agreement.At the end you ignore Her everything  and click I agree button.You can contact me via gmail:inamuddin09@...outlook:inam092@...yahoo:inamuddin2010@...AOL:charlsdarwin1969@...Join me with my Skype ID:charlsdarwin1See me on facebook:www.facebook.com/inamuddin786Follow me on my twitter:www.twitter.com/charlsdarwin1Mobile phone:+92-334-3348409Google voice:+1-631-5335683",,,,,1,222,49.68,11.5,12.24,62.77,222,22.07,82.43,62.61,53.6,18.02,11.71,7.21,0,0.9,3.6,0,6.31,13.06,5.86,6.31,13.51,8.11,3.6,4.95,1.35,15.32,1.8,0.9,2.25,0.45,0.9,0.9,14.86,1.8,13.06,2.25,1.8,4.5,3.15,0,4.05,0,3.6,3.15,0.45,1.8,1.35,0.45,0,0.45,0,0,13.51,8.11,0.45,2.25,0.45,0,4.5,5.41,0,0,1.35,2.7,1.35,0,0,1.35,2.25,0,0,2.25,0,0,1.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.6,1.8,0.9,0,0.9,0,0,0,5.41,2.7,4.5,1.35,0.45,0,0.45,0,0,26.58,11.71,2.25,0.45,0,0.9,11.26
A couple of jaws issues. 6 messages,"Hello to my fellow jaws users.
I just got off of the phone with the MS disability hotline.
The experiment that we ran was this.
1. When you are moving folders and or a huge amount of files from one folder to another and or from one hard drive to another you do see the progress of how many files have been moved and how many files that still needs to be moved.
But what you do not see like in the good old days of win 7, you do not see the processor speed that takes to move the folders and all of the files that you're moving.
But you do see the speed of your processor when you switch to narrator.
it shows the total of all the files, how many files have been move and how many are left to be copied and or moved and it shows the speed.
But it dose not show the speed when you're using jaws.
2. Also, when you move files and or folders from one place to another, the less details is checked, when you uncheck that with the spacebar your more details or greater details does pop up at you but it is unchecked.
When you do click on more details, it goes back to the less details.
So, far those are the only two details that are not working within JAWS.
I just thought my fellow jaws users would like to know this and I welcome any feedback on these features that needs to be fixed and hope that they'll be in the next upgrade of jaws.
Very Thankfully Yours,
Ron Kolesar Ham Station KR3DOG
In the good old days of Morse code Shorthand, 73's AKA Best Regards and or Best Whishes,
From Ron U.S. Ham Radio Station KR3DOGEh, Ron, enlightenment me, please?
Why knowing the processor speed so important?  Shouldn't knowing the task has been done be more important?
Just asking; not criticizing.

VinceJust curious to see how hard my processer is having to work to move larger files and or larger folders from place to place.
Hope that answers your questions.
Ron Ham Radio Station KR3DOGOkay.  Just wondered.  Cool.

VinceThe problem I am finding with this is that Jaws no longer reads the
progress/percentage unless I use the insert+t to read the top line of the
file transfer. When I click on the more info then I am able to use the
up/down arrows to keep watching the progress. I too hope that Jaws will fix
this issue.File movement operations mostly limited by the speed of the storage
media, because its the slowest part in the file transfer process.

Ram and processor are much faster than the storage drives with data
reading and writing speed.
So it rarely uses more than 10% of the processor capacity with file
transfer tasks.
And the speed we see while copying or moving files
is the PC's HDD or SSD actual data writing speed limit.
Or the HDD read speed limit, if we move files from an HDD to an SSD
drive because SSD writing is faster than the HDD data reading speed.",,,,,1,528,53.12,32.6,77.86,61.96,17.6,15.72,85.04,69.51,54.36,11.36,6.06,2.27,0.57,3.03,0,0.19,5.3,16.67,7.77,2.27,11.55,7.39,5.49,9.28,1.33,16.86,6.25,6.82,2.84,1.14,1.7,0,14.39,0.95,13.26,3.22,2.46,1.52,3.41,0,5.3,0,3.03,2.84,0.19,1.52,1.52,0,0,0,0,0,6.25,2.46,0.19,0.95,0.19,0,1.52,3.98,0,0,0.19,0,0.76,0.19,0,0.57,2.65,0,0,2.65,0,0,1.52,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.76,0.57,0.38,0,0,0,0.19,0,0.38,4.36,9.09,0.38,3.6,3.41,1.52,0,0.38,6.06,2.27,4.55,0.95,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,11.17,5.68,2.84,0.57,0,1.14,0.95

So how do I fix that so then when I go to the page in open drive that has the select all button and how can I keep it when I hit on the space bar on the

select all button to then be able to go up and hit the down loae button?

I have turned the virtual couser off and that didn't change anything but I can down load from the open drive site just fine with chrome or the brave browser.


It is just with firefox that I am getting this.

I would really like to correct this if I can.

A pair of questions regarding Skype for Windows 10,"Hi guys,

first of all I should say that I am runnig Skype for Windows desktop instead of the one for Windows 10. During a Tandem session with a friend of mine, I discovered that she's using the one for Windows 10 instead, the one from the Microsoft store; at least, I think so. So here are the questions:

1. Is there a way to add this app in the desktop?

2. Since there were some problems when going back to Skype, I decided to install the scripts by Doug Lee, but apparently they're not recognized correctly. Her JAWS version is 2020, but she still has build 2001. What can we do?

Bye!

"A perhaps ironic thing to say, but, a new way to find me...","For a long time, this has been the best place to find me for Skype script and even NVDA add-on support for Skype products, which include Skype for Windows Desktop, Skype UWP for Windows 10 though I haven't kept up so well
with that one, and Skype For Business (SFB), formerly known as Microsoft Lync.

This is still true, but the alternatives to this list are changing; and I thought I should announce this here in case it still affects anyone.

For years, I have maintained a Twitter project announcement and support account, @dlee_code. That account remains but is no longer preferred as a means of contacting me.

And now to the reason I said this message could be considered ironic:

My new preferred point of text-based contact for project support is Telegram. That would be a Skype competitor lol.

Here's how it works:

If you don't have Telegram and don't want it, you can view my project update announcements, for all my public projects including Skype-related ones, at https://t.me/s/dlee_code

The slightly shorter URL https://t.me/dlee_code will let you join my Telegram channel for project updates. That's still a view-only channel (well ok, that's what ""channel"" means on Telegram), but there's a link on that screen
(in Telegram) or page (in your browser) for a discussion group. If you join that group, you can talk back to me about projects I'm working on. Please keep any messages there related to projects of mine. The direct link for
joining that group is a bit messier: https://t.me/joinchat/OUU9GRieXgkcDYYdSXeGGQ

As for accessible Telegrams:
* The native iOS Telegram app works well enough with VoiceOver for sending and receiving messages, in my experience.
* The Unigram Windows Store app works well enough on Windows, and I have JAWS scripts for that one at https://www.dlee.org/unigram/
* I'm told that Telegram is decent on Android, but I don't have more specifics on that except that I also hear the explore-by-touch is often necessary to use it.

Other useful references:

My https://www.dlee.org/contact/ page is the official guide on how to contact me for various things.

My main website at https://www.dlee.org is the best place to find a current list of my public projects, of which there are currently about 40.

And finally, no, I am definitely not leaving Skype or abandoning the scripts for it. :-) Skype just doesn't offer me the sort of configuration I want for project-related communications, and Twitter has raised sufficient
concerns in my mind to make me move away from using it for this purpose - though my project update Telegram posts are currently also automatically posting to my @dlee_code Twitter. A page describing my reasons for this move
from Twitter to Telegram can be found at https://www.dlee.org/twit2tel.htm

Happy Skyping to all.

A thank you letter to those who tried to help me out with my combo box issues.,"Hello to all.
I ended up contacting the MS Disability hotline.
They also couldn't figure out why the combo box would work with IE 11 but not in the latest version of the new Edge browser.
So, we linked up and I showed them and they copied everything down and made a report about it.
I'm also going to be contacting FEMA and also let them know what is going on.
So we'll see what happens.
So, many thanks once again.

ADMIN: List Guidelines Reminder,"About JAWS-Users-List
English (USA)

Hello and welcome to the JAWS Users list. This list has been created for The 
purpose of discussing all aspects of the JAWS for Windows screen reader 
Program.
So everything that pertains to JAWS in regards to working with a software 
package online web page or program is fair game. For example asking about 
what
software packages work well with JAWS or how to make them work better with 
scripts, keyboard short cuts and so forth. Another example might be asking 
for
help with the Bank of America web page, or a post asking if there is a 
software package that does a specific task and works well with JAWS.

No newsletters of any type pertaining to an online event, software package 
or hardware device should ever be posted to the list prior to receiving 
moderator
approval.

Everybody should familiarize themselves with the content contained in the 
footer message that accompanies every message posted to the list.

Now this is a very important point in my opinion, asking the list for exact 
instructions every time is not a good thing to do for a major reason. It 
creates
 a dependency situation even if you don't realize it does. The ideal place I 
am hoping the list will arrive at some day is that everybody no matter how
 new they might happen to be with JAWS or computers will have the confidence 
to try things on their own, and yet feel if they get stuck the list will be
there to help put them back on track.

Trust me when I say that help is quicker to arrive for somebody who is well 
known to ask for it last than first.

So try it yourself first whatever it is. If you get stuck then let the list 
know what you've done to try and resolve your current dilemma. Then I'm sure
help will arrive with in short order.

The rules of conduct are quite simple and straightforward. Be polite and 
Patient with others. There will be absolutely no fighting, and no bashing of 
Freedom
Scientific on here at all. If you have a problem with them then take it up 
with Freedom Scientific directly. Please try to keep subject lines relevant
and descriptive as possible. Signatures and tag lines should not be more 
than a couple of sentences, three or four at the most. If you wish to 
include
a tag line, don't make another message of it. Placing anything else in there 
simply increases the bandwidth required to handle the posted message and 
make
it more work for a person who wishes to follow the given thread back to 
review previous messages, as they have to plow down past an overly long 
signature.
Also please place your message above your signature line so as not to force 
people to read it before they get to your message. Attachments are removed
before any message is sent to the list. This is done for your protection.

When contacting any of the list moderators privately please be descriptive 
in the subject line as to the purpose of the message. Also, if you have a 
question
for the list that falls within the guidelines, then post it accordingly. 
Don't contact the management team with questions that are more appropriate 
for
the list itself. Your question may or may not receive an answer for a number 
of reasons.

Occasionally there might be some difficulty with your email address and you 
may receive an email from the server asking you to reactivate your account.
Please do not simply delete this message. Instead open it and follow the 
directions to reactivate your account. If you do not after receiving a 
number
of such messages then the server will remove your email address 
automatically.

The discussion of anything illegal is absolutely forbidden, along with 
flirting or other such inappropriate activities. This is not a high tech 
swap shop
or anything of that nature at all. This means that goods and or services 
will not be bought or sold using this forum. If you know a given subject is 
off
topic then don't post it. Simply placing off topic in the subject line does 
not make it all right. Posting to a single address IE this list is the 
preferred
acceptable practice as we do not allow cross posting. That is simply posting 
to more than one list or address in the same message. You can post the same
message to multiple list, but not at the same time.

Now to the matter of replying to a posted message. The proper practice is to 
simply hit the reply command in your respective email client, IE control +
R is used quite often in many programs.

The SUBJECT: field should be short and to the point without including any 
member names. Also please do not reply to a posted question simply to say 
you
don't know the answer. All that does is create more traffic on an already 
very busy list for no reason at all. Lastly please no jokes, virus warnings,
recipes, safety tips, or pleas to help dying kids, should ever be forwarded 
to the list.

Forwarded messages and attachments are not permitted. If you have an article 
or message you feel relates to the Nature of this list send it to the list
owner and if it is appropriate, it will be posted to the list. Additionally 
if you want to make an announcement about another list send it to the list
owner for consideration. Do not post it to the list before obtaining 
approval.

No auto responders are to be used on this list! Those who use auto 
responders for vacations and so forth must make sure that this list is not 
included.
Any person who sends an auto response message will be removed!

My hope is that this list will always be a place where everybody no matter 
what their particular skill level can feel safe to ask any question at all 
within
the guidelines that I have set forth. It is my experience that such rules of 
conduct are important to keep good people on the list.

jaws-users-list@groups.ioWhen I worked for the VA, they had a national contract with FS to write and maintain scripts for CPRS, which is their patient record system.  The problem was that the VA didn't always consult with FS when making updates to CPRS, which were frequent, so there was always a catch up period where access was problematic.  We also did constant battle with the security folks who wanted to control all access to the system for everyone.  I would have to place a work order and make an appointment with a tech just to do something as simple as downloading and installing a monthly JAWS update. The stress surrounding all of this was a major factor in my decision to simply retire.

AndyI see this as a discussion of Jaws scripting.
GlennRick obviously does not and I agree.This is not a subject of scripting, it has moved passed that!

"ASCII COde, Please 10 messages","Morning all.
 
Using JAWS 2018, MS Word 13 and Windows 10 on a Dell laptop, can anyone provide me with the ascii code for a checkmark? Thanks.
 
JerryHey jerry.
 
Your question caused me to do a little bit of research. Some symbols appear to be font dependent when it comes to standard character codes; it looks like the checkmark is one of them. In other words, you will not be able to get this in the standard way using an alt code in most fonts available in Microsoft Windows. It looks like the alt code is 0252, but in most fonts, this will show up as a u diaresis (sp) symbol.
There’s a neat, rather strange, way around this, which avoids having to use the symbols list or library in MS office. I tested this and it seems to work beautifully, but you may be a little bemused.
Try this method.
Go to where you want to insert the checkmark
Type in the numbers 2713 (this is a unicode value)
Now, select those numbers with your cursor.
Now type in alt-x.
The numbers will disappear and be replaced with a checkmark.
Like so
✓Jm:
 
I also did some checking, via the wonderful world of the internet, and there is an alt code for the checkmark in MS Word 13. It is as follows:
 
Alt 10003.
Thanks for the alternative option, though.Wow, this is pretty cool – who knew!  I played around with this a bit & using the instructions below, different numbers create different symbols.  For instance typing 2708 instead of 2713, highlighting it & hitting alt x gives you an airplane!
 
Sherry WellsIf your laptop has a number pad then with number lock on hold down Alt and use 010003 followed by a space.  The heavy checkmark symbol is Alt with 010004. 
 
Brian Lee
brianllee@...I tried playing with 2713 and 2708, selecting the numbers then typing alt x.  Didn’t work.  What did I do wrong?  I also tried the checkmark and heavy checkmark and they did work.
 
Thanks in advance
 
Mona
 
Dogs have owners; cats have staff.Strange. Doesn’t sound like you did anything wrong. I was going to say that you have to make sure you *select* the number  code, and not just put your cursor on it, but it sounds like you already did this.Hi.
I didn’t really know about this either, but it *is* pretty cool. You can get all sorts of symbols this way, and I don’t think you have to mess around with the font, though I can’t be sure that they all show up correctly in all fonts.
 Cool, good to know.
A lot of the places I checcked said you had to change your font to wingdings in order to get the checkmark with the standard alt code, and that just doesn’t seem like a convenient or good option for most people.
 Mona:
Exactly which symbol were you trying to generate? I was searching for a checkmark to denote items I already had at home for a shopping list. The code I used as Alt 10003 and it placed it exactly I needed it to.

"Accessibility Driver For Screen Capture, How To Create A Toggle Keystroke 17 messages","Hi All,
 
Below are steps for creating a toggle keystroke for the, Accessibility Driver For Screen Capture, and this feature is also explained.
 
This can only be changed in the Settings Center Default All Applications in, the , Miscellaneous folder, #24 of 25.  Not the Miscellaneous folder in, Web
/ HTML / PDFs. 

The accessibility driver is a system level driver installed by our software that has been used for many years to provide screen information to JAWS. This
information is known as the Off Screen Model (OSM) and is used primarily by review cursors like the JAWS Cursor and Invisible Cursor as well as by JAWS
scripts. As Windows 10 increasingly uses different methods of displaying information, this legacy accessibility driver no longer works in many cases.
Clearing this check box configures JAWS to use new API Accessibility Monitor technology we developed in order to help overcome the missing information
previously obtained from the Accessibility Driver.
This check box is selected by default.

This feature has only been in Jaws since Jaws 2018, so if you're running a Jaws version prior to J2018 don't bother looking for this feature in the older versions.
To make a keystroke to toggle the, Use Accessibility Driver for Screen Capture, setting on and off try the following:
1. Press, Insert + F2, to open the list of Jaws managers, navigate to Keyboard Manager and press enter.
2. Press the letter, D, until Jaws reports, Default.
3. Tab 1 time into the list of default keystrokes and find the, Toggle Screen Capture Method none, entry.
4. Press, Alt + A, to open the Action menu, you are on, Add Keystroke..., so press enter.  The hotkey to go directly to the, add Keystroke, option is, Control + A,.
5. You are in a edit field so enter the keystroke you would like to assign to toggle this feature on and off.  Only type the keystroke, example:  Alt, Control + K.  Hold down the Alt & Control keys and press the letter, K, and don't type anything else but the keystroke you want to use.
6. Tab 1 time and there's a checkbox to assign this keystroke to desktop keystrokes only, that's up to you, but it's checked by default.  Tab to, Okay and press the spacebar, you'll get a dialogue asking if you're sure that you want to modify the,, Default.JKM, press the spacebar on, Yes, and you're done.  Now check the keystroke to make sure it works.  You should hear, Using Accessibility Driver On or, Using Accessibility Driver Off, when invoking your keystroke.

i am not makeing any changes in windows 7.
are these options only for the pro version? i have the home version.Hi Mike;
I looked in jaws 2018 and I couldn’t find this toggle but I was able to find it in 2019.
 
It would be good if you can give an example of what turning this feature on/off would do.

in jaws 2018, you'll find this setting,

note, when you get into the jaws settings center, you'll need to ctrl+shift+dc =default,
 
 
 
       The impossible is the untried,  Never under estimate the power of a dream. Easy enough to do, just got to figure out the benefit of doing it.Hi Net bat,
 
I don't know what to tell you other than maybe calling tech support to see if they can figure out why this feature wasn't installed with your J2018 or J2019 on your Windows 10 computer.  I have it  in both J2018 and J2019 on both my Windows 7 & 10 computers.  I'm running Jaws Home versions and my operating systems on both computers is Pro.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!Hi Larry,
 
I can't give you any examples because I'm not running any newer versions of programs that I can turn this feature on or off with to get better reading results.  I've tried this feature with my currently installed programs on my Windows 10 computer and either turned on or off didn't matter either way, but I posted the steps for those that might be able to benefit from having a toggle keystroke to turn this on / off on the fly.  Below is a thread that might give mor insight of this feature.

Hello dear listers. For a long time i use a program in order to trader in a exchange platform. The programm run under windows 7 who was the operating system
using the jaws 15 version. Before few days ago i upgrade to windows 10 32 bit using the jaws 2019 version. How ever when i load the same program in the
new operating system the jaws does not read any content in the screen using the jaws cursor. I am able to read only the top and the bottom of the window.
Any recomentation for a solution is wellcome and thanks for any assistance.

As much as  you may not like this answer, there may not be a good solution for this.
The Jaws cursor under Windows 10 has not nearly as much access to information as it did under Windows 7 simply because of how Microsoft allows screenreaders
to get access to what is on the screen. I use a couple of applications at my store for accounting and my point of sale where I have similar issues.
Vispero is working on this and you could try and see what happens if you turn off the accessibility display driver which is what Jaws has been using for
a long time to get information. Do the following and then open your program and see if it helped:
 
1. Open Jaws Settings Center with Jaws Key + 6 on the number row
2. Make sure you have the default settings loaded by pressing Control + Shift + D
3. Type ""acc"" (the first 3 letters of accessibility) in the search box, then tab once and you should have the following two results:
Speak Access Keys Within Web Pages _x001D_checked, ReadingUse Accessibility Driver for Screen Capture _x001D_checked, Miscellaneous
_x001D_not checked_x001E_
4. Press the spacebar on the second option, Use Accessibility Display Driver"" to clear the checkbox
5. Tab twice to OK and activate it.
6. Make sure you remember or keep these steps because you may find that some applications work better with the old accessibility display driver checked
and some may work better when it is unchecked.
And there is a bit of good news, Vispero is working on restoring more of the old Jaws cursor functionality with the new so-called GDI hooking method which
is basically what Jaws uses to get information when the accessibility display driver is unchecked.
Lastly, you may want to try the touch cursor with your program and see if you get anything with that, you can activate it by pressing Shift + PC Cursor
(Numpad +), press the PC cursor twice quickly to deactivate the touch cursor again. You can read more about it here:
Jaws Help > Help topics > Using Jaws > About cursors > Using the Touch cursor

Subject: [jaws-users] Accessibility Driver 
For Screen Capture, How To Create

A Toggle Keystroke

Hi All,

Below are steps for creating a toggle keystroke for the, Accessibility
Driver For Screen Capture, and this feature is also explained.

This can only be changed in the Settings 
Center Default All Applications in,

the , Miscellaneous folder, #24 of 25.  Not the Miscellaneous folder in,
Web
/ HTML / PDFs.

The accessibility driver is a system level driver installed by our software

that has been used for many years to provide screen information to JAWS.
This
information is known as the Off Screen Model (OSM) and is used primarily by

review cursors like the JAWS Cursor and Invisible Cursor as well as by JAWS
scripts. As Windows 10 increasingly uses different methods of displaying
information, this legacy accessibility driver no longer works in many
cases.
Clearing this check box configures JAWS to 
use new API Accessibility Monitor

technology we developed in order to help overcome the missing information
previously obtained from the Accessibility Driver.
This check box is selected by default.



This feature has only been in Jaws since Jaws 2018, so if you're running a
Jaws version prior to J2018 don't bother looking for this feature in the
older versions.
To make a keystroke to toggle the, Use Accessibility Driver for Screen
Capture, setting on and off try the following:
1. Press, Insert + F2, to open the list of Jaws managers, navigate to
Keyboard Manager and press enter.
2. Press the letter, D, until Jaws reports, Default.
3. Tab 1 time into the list of default keystrokes and find the, Toggle
Screen Capture Method none, entry.
4. Press, Alt + A, to open the Action menu, 
you are on, Add Keystroke..., so

press enter.  The hotkey to go directly to the, add Keystroke, option is,
Control + A,.
5. You are in a edit field so enter the keystroke you would like to assign
to toggle this feature on and off.  Only type the keystroke, example:  Alt,

Control + K.  Hold down the Alt & Control keys and press the letter, K, and

don't type anything else but the keystroke you want to use.
6. Tab 1 time and there's a checkbox to assign this keystroke to desktop
keystrokes only, that's up to you, but it's checked by default.  Tab to,
Okay and press the spacebar, you'll get a dialogue asking if you're sure
that you want to modify the,, Default.JKM, press the spacebar on, Yes, and
you're done.  Now check the keystroke to make sure it works.  You should
hear, Using Accessibility Driver On or, Using 
Accessibility Driver Off, when

invoking your keystroke.

I'm planning to do it, but I'd just like to know where this is coming from??
 
Regards,

Yes the on/off feature for the accessibility feature is under the miscellaneous in 2018 but I couldn’t find the toggle to set up the hot key in 2018 only in 2019.
 Hi Larry,
 
Although J2018 has the use accessibility driver For screen capture feature, in Settings Center / default all applications, and I didn't notice this until you mentioned it, as you stated it does not have the keystroke assignment in the default keyboard manager.  This is with both my Windows 7 & 10 computers.

Administrator Assistant Software 8 messages,"Morning all.
 
Using JAWS 2018, MS Office 13 and Windows 10 on a Dell laptop, can anyone tell me if there is a software program for performing Administrator Assistant duties i.e. setting appointments, etc.? I know that some of this can be created in Office, but was just wondering about a program already created to do these functions. I was on the JAWS Users website, under the programs and productivity pages, but did not find out anything regarding this inquiry. Thanks much.
JerryI have never come across any free software that will perform those tasks, sorry.I would use google calendar to set appointments. 
 
But, among the other activities, you might have to just go activity by activity, and see which product, software,  or service worked better.

JerryGood Morning,
Focus on the message, press the context key and select properties. On the Detail tab you will find the sent date. You will probably have to use the Jaws cursor to read this page in it’s entirety.
MarieJerry, didn't you ask this the other day?
GlennSorry, that should be the general tab instead of the detail tab.
MarieHi Jerry,
I remember now, you were wondering how to find a message last time.
To find the sent date, it is pretty easy.
I think the default is to display the sent date, and not the receive date.
If this is the case, when the message is open, press alt + the #2 key to hear the date.
If it shows the receive date by default, you can change that in settings.

Another Winamp Question 25 messages,"Hello, everyone.
 
Within the past few wekes, whenever I try to play an audio file from my external hard drive with Winamp, I get a message that says something like:  “Winamp has detected a an external drive;  do you want Winamp to access  this drive?”.
 
There is a yes/no button, but I can’t get to it.
 
I have tried enter, and the space bar.  I also have tried rooting the Jaws cursor to the PC cursor, but have had no luck.
 
Occasionally, after trying, I can get the message to play, but then I get an error message about reporting the problem to Winamp.
 
And, once I get these messages, the only way I can get rid of them is to completely shut down and re-boot my computer.
 
Has anyone experienced this issue?  If so, how can I respond, or better yet, how can I turn this anoying notification off?
 
I’m using windows 10 version 1809 with the latest build of Jaws 2019.
 
Thanks!
 
Tom BehlerI have not found a way to shut off the device detection setting in Winamp, however, you do not have to turn your computer off to fix the issue.
 
Simply bring up your task manager with control+shift+escape and arrow down until you hear Winamp.  Pressing alt+E will end the process and you can then use Winamp as normal from then on.
 
You don’t have to arrow down the list though, you can just press the W key until you land on Winamp, then end the process.
 
I would be interested if anyone is able to turn this feature on and off with Winamp.
 
VictorThanks, Victor.
 
This is very helpful.
 
Tom BehlerHi Tom,
 
First I don't use Winamp so my suggestions are only that.  Have you tried pressing, Alt + Y, for yes, or pressing, Alt + N, for no?  Also you could try tabbing to see if you can highlight the Yes and No buttons or try the Touch Cursor to see if you can sneak up on those rascals.

I don’t know what the new version is like, so I can’t say if it does the same thing or not.
 
VictorHi Tom & Victor,

From: Bill White
Hi, Tom. Try the following,
 
In the Winamp program, go to Preferences > Plugins > Portables > look for the USB one, and hit the uninstall button
 
Or with Winamp closed, delete pmp_usb.dll from the Program Files (x86)\Winamp\Plugins folder.

Once again, I started experienceing this issue several weeks ago, so it is fairly recent.
 
Tom BehlerHi Tom,
 
Just for the future, you don't need a touch screen to use the touch cursor.  Below is the touch cursor explained:
 
From: Rebecca Lineberger
I’ve had this stored for a while, and can’t remember now if this came from the Help Menu or from the Vispero website.  It mentions Windows 8, but I think
the information is still relevant for Windows 10.
 
 
 Object Navigation Using the Touch Cursor 
 
Certain applications, especially many of the modern-style apps found in Windows 8, do not always work as expected with JAWS when navigating with the standard
cursors such as the PC and Virtual PC cursors. Activating the new Touch Cursor enables you to use the
 
ARROW
 
keys on your computer's keyboard, or the controls on your braille display, to navigate through the actual objects in an application similar to using gestures
on the touch screen of a tablet. Application objects include everything from menu bars, toolbars, and progress bars, to form controls, regions, links,
etc. Press
 
SHIFT+NUM PAD PLUS
 
, or
 
SHIFT+CAPS LOCK+SEMICOLON
 
if using the laptop keyboard layout, to activate the Touch Cursor. To turn it off, activate one of the other cursors, like the JAWS or PC Cursor. Pressing
the PC Cursor command (
 
NUM PAD PLUS
 
) will cause JAWS to say ""Touch Cursor"" and the Touch Cursor will remain active. If Tutor Messages are enabled, JAWS will also speak the message ""Double
tap to activate PC cursor"". Press the PC Cursor command twice quickly to turn off the Touch Cursor and activate the PC Cursor.  
 
The Touch Cursor is enabled by default in certain Windows 8 applications to improve navigation. These apps include News, Weather, and Store. Whenever you
move focus to one of these apps, the Touch Cursor is automatically activated. To automatically enable the Touch Cursor in another application, press
 
INSERT+V
 
to open Quick Settings while focused in the application where you want to use the Touch Cursor, expand the Touch Cursor Options group, and then select
Automatic Activation. You must do this for every application where you want to have JAWS automatically turn on the Touch Cursor.  
 
Once the Touch Cursor is active, pressing
 
RIGHT
 
or
 
LEFT ARROW
 
will move to the next or previous object on the screen. This is the same as doing a left or right flick on a touch screen. Pressing
 
UP
 
or
 
DOWN ARROW
 
will move to the previous or next object by type. By default, these commands will move by region, or group if you are on the Windows 8 Start screen. This
is the same as doing an up or down flick on a touch screen. To change what object type these commands move by, press
 
PAGE UP
 
or
 
PAGE DOWN
 
to cycle through the available types. For example, if you want the
 
UP
 
or
 
DOWN ARROW
 
keys to move by headings, press
 
PAGE UP
 
or
 
PAGE DOWN
 
until you hear ""headings"". Now, pressing
 
UP
 
or
 
DOWN ARROW
 
will move to the next or previous heading.  
 
Press
 
CTRL+HOME
 
to move to the first object and press
 
CTRL+END
 
to move to the last object. To announce the current object, press
 
INSERT+UP ARROW
 
. To perform a Say All, which will cause the Touch Cursor to move through the application and speak each object, press
 
INSERT+DOWN ARROW
 
.  
 
As you navigate using the
 
ARROW
 
keys, the system focus does not follow the Touch Cursor. This allows you to freely navigate objects without changing the position of the PC Cursor or mouse
pointer. Pressing
 
SPACEBAR
 
or
 
ENTER
 
on the current element will move focus to that element and perform the appropriate action similar to double tapping on a touch screen. For instance, opening
a menu, selecting a check box, or activating a button or link. In addition, a rectangle will be displayed around the currently selected object to visually
indicate the location of the Touch cursor for sighted users.  
 
If the Touch Cursor is on an object containing text, such as the body of a news article, you can press
 
INSERT+ENTER
 
or
 
NUM PAD SLASH
 
to enable Text Review. In this mode, you can use the
 
ARROW
 
keys as well as all other standard reading commands to read the text as if you were reading a regular document. Pressing the
 
ESC
 
key will exit Text Review and return to Touch Cursor navigation.  
 
A good example of using the Touch Cursor is in the News app, where it is enabled by default. Once the app launches, you could press
 
DOWN ARROW
 
to move to the /Top Stories region and then press
 
RIGHT ARROW
 
to move to a particular story. When you find the article you want to read, you can press
 
INSERT+ENTER
 
or
 
NUM PAD SLASH
 
to switch to Text Review so you can use the
 
ARROW
 
keys or the braille display to read the article. Once you are finished, press
 
ESC
 
to close Text Review and then use
 
RIGHT
 
or
 
LEFT ARROW
 
to select another article from the current region, or
 
UP
 
or
 
DOWN ARROW
 
to move to a different region.  
 
Touch Cursor Navigation Quick Keys  
 
While the Touch Cursor is active, you can use Navigation Quick Keys to quickly jump to various types of objects, such as regions, headings, links, form
controls, and so on. These commands are similar to the Navigation Quick Keys that are used when navigating HTML and PDF documents with the Virtual PC Cursor.
 
 
By default, Touch Navigation Quick Keys are not enabled when the Touch Cursor is activated. This allows you to fully use applications that support typing
in the main window. For example, the News app lets you type so you can quickly locate specific stories.  
 
If you would like Touch Navigation Quick keys to be enabled automatically when the Touch Cursor is activated in a specific application, press
 
INSERT+V
 
to open Quick Settings while focused in the application, navigate to the Touch Cursor Options group, and select Touch Quick Keys. You can also press
 
INSERT+Z
 
while the Touch Cursor is active to temporarily toggle Touch Navigation Quick Keys on or off.  
 
Advanced Object Navigation  
 
For advanced users, specifically those who may be involved with developing applications, Advanced Navigation provides more detail about all objects in
the UIA (User Interface Automation) structure.  
 
With the standard Touch Cursor, you can only navigate objects that are visible on the screen in the current application. In Advanced Navigation, the Touch
Cursor traverses all UIA objects in a hierarchical manner. All Objects, whether visible or not, can be traversed in Advanced Navigation.  
 
To enable Advanced Navigation, press
 
NUM PAD STAR
 
, or
 
CAPS LOCK+A
 
if using the laptop keyboard layout, while the Touch Cursor is active. Once active, use the
 
LEFT
 
and
 
RIGHT ARROW
 
keys to move to the previous or next sibling object and the
 
UP
 
and
 
DOWN ARROW
 
keys to move to the parent object or the first child object. To view more Advanced Navigation commands, press
 
INSERT+H
 
while this mode is active. Press
 
NUM  PAD STAR once more to turn off Advanced Navigation and return to the standard Touch Cursor.

Tom BehlerHave you tried alt tabbing to it?
Sometimes these can duck behind the application's window.
GlennYes, I have tried the alt tab, but no luck.
 
I should have mentioned that earlier.
 
Tom BehlerStrange, I do vaguely remember this message but don’t recall having accessibility issues with it. It was annoying though. Winamp does not need a plugin to access a USB drive/stick/whatever as this is comletely operating system-dependent, normally.
So, I uninstalled the plugin quite some time back, I think.Hi Jean,
 
No, that’s not what I meant.
 
Winamp has a portable device detection plug-in that recognizes when the computer is connected to a USB device.  The problem is that Winamp doesn’t distinguish between external drives, USB sticks or other devices, and so it brings up the dialog box for every thing that’s plugged into the USB port, though it doesn’t seem to think my printer is a media device.  LOL.
 
VictorI've always been annoyed by this too, and I'd like a way to turn it off.
But with my Windows 7, and next to the latest Jaws, I've always been able to close it.
Perhaps the latest update is what prevented the one with the original post, to close it
GlennThat is exactly what I meant though. I haven’t seen this prompt/message in years, and I have multiple USB mass storage devices that I plug in and unplug every day. I seem to remember being able to dispense with the message 8before* I got rid of the plugin, but now, yeah, I’m not toally sure. I disposed of two or three plugins because I noticed that Winamp suddenly became slow to load; this was one of them that is easy to sacrifice, since there’s no reason Winamp needs to know or care what kind of storage device you are using.",,,,,1,2223,72.02,17.99,68.54,45.99,16.23,18.26,79.44,62.57,50.16,9.99,5.22,2.88,0.04,2.16,0,0.09,4.77,14.3,8.28,1.44,13.36,7.24,4.09,7.6,1.57,15.47,4.59,2.02,2.74,0.22,1.26,1.39,15.74,1.57,13.99,2.47,3.06,2.25,3.91,0.22,5.31,0.18,2.47,2.07,0.36,0.58,0.4,0.13,0.04,0.09,0,0,6.88,3.69,0.58,0.4,0.09,0,2.07,3.15,0.09,0,0,0,1.98,0,0,1.98,2.56,0.27,0.45,1.71,0.13,0,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.4,0.54,0.36,0.04,0,0.04,0.31,0.22,4.18,10.35,0.63,2.38,5.08,0.58,0.18,1.89,4.9,2.43,5.08,1.03,0.27,0.04,0.22,0,0,16.91,6.21,6.21,0.27,0.27,1.26,2.7

Answers to a couple more Skype 8 script questions,"Answering a couple questions asked in various places:

If you find an slman.jcf file in your JAWS user folder, it is safe and perhaps wise to delete it.

The revision 129 shown in the installer and by Insert+q for the revision 130 scripts is harmless and an accident, but the code is correct. I'm not fixing the revision number because that would prompt another round of
translation exchanges for non-English scripts.

The revision 130 scripts should work in Skype 8.51.0.86 and also 8.51.0.92, which was released this week.

Are there some updated contacts for Skype dev team?,"Hi guys,
    I'd like to contact Skype support for a thing that I am
      encountering because I think it's a bug, but anyway if you figured
      out something feel free to answer. Basically, yesterday I manually
      updated Skype to version 8.61 as soon as it went out, and I
      figured out that hotkeys mostly don't work, such as alt+numbers
      for going in to the various Skype parts, or ctrl+shift+p to start
      an audio call. I only manage to go to the contacts tab with alt+2,
      but then nothing works. So I'd like to contact Skype support and
      wanted to know how should I do for it right now.

Big long updates 29 messages,"Hi guys.  Has anyone experienced installing Windows updates lately?  I just
had one.  Fortunately, today my sighted friend was here and that was good,
but apparently my computer was trying to install a big update from May for
Windows 10 and it didn't install.  Well, there was a time back on July 10
that Jaws didn't start and I had to reboot a few times.  These updates are a
real pain.  Jaws doesn't warn me when there is a Windows update or anything.
It's really stupid.  It used to be that there were warnings and the updates
installed faster.  What do you do when you get updates?  How do you know
when you get them?Hi Cheryl,
 
When you say Jaws wouldn't start, do you mean the computer was running and Jaws wasn't responding?  Or, did you start your computer and Jaws wouldn't start?

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Hi Mike.  I mean that I would turn on my computer and Jaws wouldn't start.
I didn't know what was going on.  Then I rebooted several times and it
finally worked.  This was a month ago.  Then my sighted friend came today
and told me that an update needs to be installed.  Anyway, good that he got
it installed.Hi Cheryl,
 
If Jaws doesn't come up after starting the computer this means that there's a good possibility that the operating system is doing something in the background and rebooting the computer could possibly cause unknown things to happen and they're usually not good to an update if that's what's happening.  If this happens again you should be able to start Narrator and navigate with it.  If the operating system is updating this means it's in a pre-windows state and Jaws can't run in a pre-windows state.  Narrator will be able to give you an idea as to what's happening and then just give the computer time to do its thing and it'll probably reboot on its own or give you a message telling you it needs to be rebooted.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Hi Mike.  I tried to run Narrator, but it didn't run.  Nothing worked or I
couldn't see the screen.  Oh well, maybe next time I'll ask someone to pop
in and read the screen.  I don't know why I couldn't get Narrator to come
up.Or use a mobile phone to scan the screen if you have one. Applications such
as SeeingAI work well for this purpose.

Microsoft tends to release Windows updates on the second Tuesday of the
month, so around that time each month, I just use Check for Updates to bring
in the latest (including the latest security fixes, which are important).
Those who don't keep their software up to date are more vulnerable to
malware and other malicious activity, so I try to stay ahead by ensuring I
have the latest installed. (The same holds for Microsoft Office, Web
browsers, and anything else that connects to the Internet.)Hi Jason.  I don't have a smart phone.  I can't use them.  Touch screens
really baffle me.  I need something with buttons.  I know lots of people can
do finger flicks, but I can't.Hi Cheryl,
 
Somewhere along the line the start up and Turn off keystrokes for Narrator changed.  Just in case you didn't know this here's the keystrokes plus the scan keystrokes for reviewing the screen.
 
Press ctrl + windows + Enter to start and stop Narrator.
Use shift + spacebar to start and stop scan mode.
when Narrator is in scan mode Its like useing the Jaws cursor. You arrow up and down and use spacebar to activate items.
Wwhen scan mode is off its like the PC cursor  you tab to controls and press spacebar to activate them.
Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Hi Mike.  Okay.  Thanks.  Would Narrator really work if the computer is
doing an update?  How come Jaws won't work during an update?Hi Cheryl,
 
I'm only speculating here because this hasn't happened to me and I don't have any first hand experieence, but while the computer is updating the sound drivers might not be loded so neither Narrator or Jaws will be heard.  Once your update has finished I would think the sound would return and whatever screen reader you had running at the time will start talking.

I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Hi Mike.  Okay.  Well who knows.  Hopefully it doesn't happen again.usually because the update is updateing before windows is loaded no windows , no jaws.
the other thing is many times if you  have a large download or a large number of files you are copying  the c p u will turn off the on board sound card so free up more c p u power until it has finished its task. then it will turn the sound card back on.
that is what may happen when you hear the  screen reader voice studder for a few seconds when accessing a hard drive.I've never had Jaws automatically start downloading it has always required me to press ok to start the download. 

LarryIf you're using Windows 10 it automatically downloads all updates on a daily
bases.If you are talking about the major upgrades to Windows 10 then Narrator will work while upgrading.Hi Mike,

while the computer is updating the
sound drivers might not be loded so neither Narrator or Jaws will be heard.
Once your update has finished I would think the sound would return and
whatever screen reader you had running at the time will start talking.
If there are no sound card drivers to be run in safe mode, WNarrator doesn't speak and no screen reader can speak either. But if any installed sound card drivers work during safe mode, Windows will use those to run Narrator. I have a USB sound card and another built into thee motherboard. In safe mode and while updating, Narrator only uses the motherboard sound card because the USB interface needs Windows to run. But on my laptop, my internal sound card doesn't load at all in safe mode. Nonetheleess, when I'm updating Windows, Narrator manages to get hold of this internal sound card in order to speak. I'm not sure why this doesn't happen in safe mode, which is where I would need Narrator most. As it stands, I can't use safe mode on my laptop without sighted assistance. But all my installed screen readers work in safe mode on my desktop.


Orlando Enrique FiolHi Orlando,
 
That's what I thought.  Thank you very much for the verification.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.I appreciate the discussion on this. I have an HP desktop PC, Windows 10 version 1903, latest JAWS. When I have updates available, I am given an option either to update and restart or update and shut down. Thus, I know when they are coming. The minor updates seem to take very little time to accomplish. When the major update of 1903 was presented, the update and restart option did not work initially. I went to check my updates and was presented the option to restart now or to schedule the restart later. I didn’t do this the first time because I was scared. After writing this list and receiving encouragement from you guys, with fear and trepidation, I restarted the PC from the Check for Updates screen. I went to another room and waited. About 20minutes later, the PC began talking again. Upon checking things out, it was just fine.
 I know this is a silly question. How do I check for updates and cause the question to come up? I do not think I am getting updates. I have Windows 10.

Blocked shut downs issue 4 messages,"
If I have Jaws 2018, or Jaws 2019 load at login and after login, when I go
to shut down or restart, the operation is blocked and there is nothing I can
do other than power down.

I only had one version loading of course, but I tried with each separately.

If I use Narrator at login and after login, I can restart or shut down with
no issues what so ever.
Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, how was it resolved?

www.turner42.comHi Richard,
 
Off the top of my head and not having experienced this behavior personally, this kind of smells like a permissions issue between Jaws & Windows 10.  I don't know how this would be changed, but I don't think it's a very hard fix if this is the case.
Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!

O if it was an easy fix where permissions are concerned, but unlikely as Microsoft assures me I have full administrative rights on my machine.

Brave Browser 32 messages,"I heard about Brave in the FS podcast and I just got it. It does work well with jaws 2019. I like it and since I heard that google is not getting safe regarding security, I will use it and I sometimes google freezes and affects jaws. So I will play with Brave. It is similar to google.You're getting brave and trying it ay?
 Actually it's very similar to Chrome and it does work very well with Jaws.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!I just installed the brave browser and so far I like it pretty well.I had to try to be punny.
 There is one issue.  If you save your book marks in folders.  If you do
control D then tab to more press space tab to where it should show your
folders it doesn't read anything.  Chrome had this issue and it was fixed
now they need to fix it for Brave.I like it, too, but had issues when using it with Amazon.  When contacting
their support, apparently there are known issues in navigating Amazon, so I
went back to Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.

There is a great browser I downloaded on my phone called Private Browser
Pro, and haven't checked to see whether or not it is available for the PC.

But my alltime favorite browser is Kiwi Browser, and also wonder if there is
a PC version.

On my phone it is very fast and very clean without the clutter you see on a
lot of browsers.

""Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.""Yes. JAWS 2019 works well. No issues. Brave is similar to google. It has the same setting, how to get to the menu. I do not see much difference. It looks stable and is fast.Yes. I like it. If it continues to do so, I will not use google.Yes. Happy July 4 for those who live in the Great USA. Hope this is allow and I will not get people mad of me because it is not jaws question.🎆  🎇  🧨
 
Everyone celebrate!

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”
 I see my imports from google. When I go down tobook marks, I see them.Look what you started now foldger I hope it stops, please.I just went to amazon. What was your problem? I was able to move within the
page and did a search and could see what I was looking.My fault for not changing the subject, my apologies, the enthusiasm got the best of me.  Sorry group.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”I had some problems with the login, but they may have fixed them by now,
good to hear.

""Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.""I knew that I will get blame. I am sorry for showing my love for the US.When I transfer my password and so on from google to Brave it load the web
page without no issues.You are mixing apples and oranges.?? Brave is a browser.?? Google is a search engine.?? So how can Brave be similar to Google?

CCleaner question 5 messages,"Hi, for those that have the pro version that can do things like automatically delete browsing on exit is there a way to tell what is checked and unchecked?  Thanks.If you check and uncheck the first item in the list, the checkboxes appear beside each item.
 
VictorHow do  you tell CCleaner what you want it clean from the browser?
 Yeah, usually when there are multiple check boxes and I realize that I won't know which one I'm checking, I go back to the first one, like Victor indicated, and see if the item comes after or before the check box.
Usually that is the only to know what is being checked.
Sometimes if the page is written right, it echoes what is checked when you check it.
 
GlennActually Glen,
 
In this case, it seems to be a bug with Jaws and the C-Cleaner application.
 
When you arrow down the list, the first item in the list is shown with a checkbox, but everything after that does not have a checkbox beside it.
 
When you check and uncheck the first checkbox, for some odd reason, the other checkboxes down the list appear out of no where.
 
It’s really weird, but there you have it.

Call for Skype 8 (Electron) JAWS script testing assistance,"I announced this on Twitter recently and forgot to announce it here...

I have prepared a set of JAWS scripts for Skype 8 (Electron) for which I need some testing done on other computers out there. The script update fixes the announcement of dates in Skype chats, which should work fine everywhere
in English and hopefully in other languages. There is another feature though that is why I am requesting testing help:

The beta scripts try to adapt their own loading method based on your JAWS version, so that the scripts work identically for all supported JAWS versions. This peculiar bit of coding is required because of changes between JAWS
versions in how scripts are loaded for Electron apps.

So, I need to know the following from whoever out there is willing to report back:

* Do the scripts work reliably under each of JAWS 17, 18, 2018, and 2019?

Of course, I figure each tester will test only one or two JAWS versions; I'm just hoping to get results for each version overall.

Note that you may, on first running these scripts, hear an alert message and may be asked to restart JAWS once. This is because JAWS sometimes fails to detect changes to a file that governs how scripts are loaded
(ConfigNames.ini, for those techies out there who care) until the next JAWS restart.

If you need to retreat to the main release, you can always run the official installer found from https://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/ to reinstall the official script version.

The direct link to the beta scripts is https://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/jfw_skypeelectron119beta.exe

Camera Not Working on Skype Windows 10? Here's How to Fix It,"I recently did a post on Skype's microphone issue and how it is not
    working for so many users. After reading that post, some of our
    users asked us to do a similar post for Skype's camera issue. See,
    the camera is not working on Skype for many Windows 10 users. Users
    are frustrated because they can't attend meetings and had a video
    conference calls. Don't worry, we got you covered.

    There can be multiple reasons behind why the camera is refusing to
    connect with or give permission to Skype to use it. Let's take a
    look at them one by one.

    Camera Not Working on Skype

    
    1. Skype is Down

    
    Different apps and software can go out of
      service for a number of reasons like DDoS attacks, malware, bugs,
      and so on. While I would recommend Down Detector to check service
      outages on any given day, for Skype, Microsoft has created a
      dedicated page themselves.

      Follow the link below to check if Skype is facing any issues.

      Visit Skype

      2. Updates

      
      Has Microsoft released a new update for Skype? Before moving on,
      there are two ways to install Skype. If you have installed it from
      the Windows Store, then you can check the updates section to see
      if there is one available. If so, update it immediately.

      If you have installed the Skype app directly from the official
      site, then you will have to either launch the app to if there is
      an update prompt, or you can go back and download Skype again.
      This is why it is better to download from the Windows Store unless
      it is giving you troubles.

      3. Network Connection & Troubleshooting

      
      Check your Internet and WiFi connection and make sure that it is
      working. Skype video calling can consume a lot of bandwidth and
      needs a high-speed Internet connection to work without any lags.
      One thing you can do is to visit Speedtest site and check your
      download and upload speeds. Another thing you can do is connect a
      smartphone or some other device to your WiFi network and check if
      it is working right. This way, you will know whether the issue is
      with WiFi or your laptop/computer where you can use Skype.

      

      Windows 10 computer comes with a network troubleshooter that will
      check your network connection and test it for various errors. If
      you have reason to believe that there is something wrong with the
      network connection, search for network troubleshooter in the
      Windows search and run it. Follow the on-screen instructions if an
      error is found. You may also visit the Microsoft
        help page where they explain, in detail, why Skype can't
      detect webcam on Windows 10.

      Visit Speedtest

      4. Reinstall

      
      Reinstalling any software or app can solve a lot of problems
      including bad and corrupted files, bugs, and so on. Having said
      that, reinstalling is just part of the process. You need to remove
      old files too. First, right-click on Skype to uninstall it.

      When you uninstall an app, it leaves left-over files on your
      system which can be corrupted. To delete them before you reinstall
      a fresh copy of Skype, press Ctrl+R to open the Run prompt and
      type ""%appdata%"" without the quotes before hitting Enter.

      Delete the Skype folder found here.

      

      Now you can either visit the Microsoft Store to download Skype
      which is what we suggest or download directly from the site. Many
      users have reported that installing from the site actually solved
      the camera not working on Skype issue for them. Maybe it is worth
      a shot so do try. Note that updating apps is a lot easier if you
      install it via the Store. Click on the Get Skype for Windows 10
      button to choose an alternative, Get Skype for Windows to download
      the file on your hard drive.

      Also note that when you do a fresh install of Skype, the app will
      ask you to give it necessary permissions to use the microphone and
      the camera. This will help it provide audio and video.

      Download Skype

      5. Webcam Permissions

      
      You did everything right and have given the app necessary
      permissions to use your camera but still see the 'no device found'
      error in Skype. It is possible that the settings have failed to
      register the change due to some bug. To check, press Windows key+I
      keys on your keyboard to launch Settings and select Privacy here.

      Select Camera in the left window pane and scroll a little to find
      a list of all the apps that have permission to use the camera.
      Find Skype here and make sure that it is toggled on.

      Check if camera is working on Skype in Windows 10.

      6. Skype Cam Settings

      
      Apart from Windows 10 settings, each app comes with its own
      settings and Skype is no different. Launch Skype and click on the
      menu button to open Settings.

      Select Audio and Video in the left window pane here and you should
      see your webcam working. If it is not working, use the drop down
      menu above to select the correct camera device. Maybe you have
      more than one installed?

      7. Webcam Drivers

      
      Webcam on your Windows 10 computer is a hardware device which
      needs drivers in order to connect and work with Skype and other
      apps that uses it. Are you using the latest drivers? Are they
      corrupt? To search for and install an update, open the Device
      Manager and look for webcam device that is installed on your
      computer. Usually, it should be under Imaging Devices.
      Double-click to open it and right-click on the camera hardware to
      update the drivers.

      Once done, reboot your Windows 10 PC to check if the camera on
      Skype is working again or not.

      8. Run Troubleshooter

      
      Windows 10 comes with a troubleshooter that will hunt for bugs and
      other problems that are plaguing your computer and will recommend
      necessary solutions for them. Search for Troubleshooting in
      Windows search open it in Settings. There are a lot of
      troubleshooting options but I am going with Windows Store Apps
      since I have installed Skype from there and as mentioned earlier,
      it is a known issue.

      Follow the on-screen instructions in case it finds some error. You
      may try other related troubleshooters based on your hardware and
      software configuration. Check if Skype can detect the webcam now
      or is it still not working.

      9. Webcam Compatibility

      
      Unlike Apple's Macs, Windows computers come in a variety of
      configurations which involve different processors, webcam units,
      sound devices, RAM from companies that manufacture them. How do
      you know that the webcam installed in your system is compatible
      with Skype or not?

      Fortunately, someone over at Ubuntu has compiled a list of all the
      known computer models with webcam units that are compatible with
      Skype. Please go
        through the list and note that even if your's is not in the
      list, it is possible that the list was not updated or is
      incomplete.

      10. Reset Skype

      
      Resetting Skype is a much better option than say, formatting or
      resetting Windows 10. The latter will delete all apps, software,
      and data stored on your computer leaving you with an empty canvas.
      Taking backups and reinstalling everything can be an arduous task.
      To reset Skype, press the Windows key+I keys on your keyboard and
      select Apps.

      Select Apps & features and find Skype in the list. when you
      do, click on it once to reveal the Advanced options button.

      Scroll a little to find two options. One is Repair and the other
      is Reset. I would suggest here to first go with the repair option
      and see if it resolves the camera not working on Skype issue. If
      it fails to work, go for the reset option which will delete all
      settings and data from your computer.

      When you log back in, it will download fresh files and data from
      the web. What this will do is clear all corrupted files and create
      new ones.

      Camera Not Working on Skype in Windows 10

      
      The camera and microphone issue in Skype is nothing new. There are
      many different ways to solve these errors as I explained to you in
      the post above. I do not suggest formatting your computer as that
      can be cumbersome and the error may return again.

-SugarI remember checking the website to see how far back you could go with downloads. this was two or three years ago and you could go to the combo box and download version two or three.
More recently, I found that the earliest you could go was version 10 so they must have removed those versions that were out of date and would not work with windows 7 and or 10.

Can Jaws speak incoming messages while I am typing?typing,"Hi,


Is there a way to get Jaws to continue to read incoming messages while I am typing to send a message? This used to work flawlessly in Skype 7, but has not worked at all since Skype 8.. I'm using Jaws 2020 and/or 2019, and the latest version of Windows10.

Canon MX479 Printer Help 2 messages,"Evening folks.
 
Using JAWS 2018, Windows 10 on a Dell laptop with a Canon MX479 Multifunctional printer, I am having a strange issue. I am trying to print some things out, and it does not seem to want to print. I have it connected via bluetooth, and all of the settings are correct, and it is connected to our wify. We have even tried restarting it several times with no success. Any suggestions/ideas? Thanks in advance.I guess the first thing you would want to do is find out if it’s a connectivity issue, or something else.
If it’s got uSB also, try connecting this way and see if you get any results.
There probably is something like a Canon support forum where you’d likely get better help/answers for this specific printer.
And, of course, this should go without saying, but be sure to read the user manual.

Chrome Settings for Notifications 5 messages,"Hello,
A friend is having trouble sending messages to the list for some reason, so I'm posting his question.
He went to Send Space and he has started getting pop-up ads on his computer, and this happens as long as Chrome is open, or even after it's closed, unless he goes into task manager and closes all instances of Chrome there, or reboots.
I had this problem and I found notifications in Chrome settings under advanced, and I tried to help him find it and I could not find it, on his computer or on mine.
It was in mine, because I had to go into notifications to turn it off, or block ads from coming up on that site.
Either I forgot where I found it, or Google has updated Chrome to not have a notifications option.
Can anyone give the levels in Chrome settings to block ads from certain sites?
Thanks.
 
GlennHi Glenn,
 
I couldn't expand the Advanced collapsed heading level 2 where Notifications is located using Jaws2019, but I could open the Advanced using J18 and J2018.
To access the Advanced collapsed folder:
1. Open Chrome, press, Alt + F, then the letter, S, to open settings.
2. Navigate by heading using the letter, H, until you hear, Advanced ... collapsed, and press enter or spacebar.
3. Now navigate by heading again until you hear, Advanced ... expanded, and down arrow to find the settings you want.

1, be in the cell roll you want it to be read, like A1
2, Press insert V
3, press the letter T
4, arrow down to title reading
5, arrow down one time to, Define Name Column and Row Titles off
6, press the space bar until you hear current file
7, arrow down two times to title reading detection off
8, press the space bar
A, the first choice is read the column
B, read the row
C, read both
9, after you make your choice then press enter twice
Then it will go back to the work sheet
 
Hi List, Is there a quick way or shortcut command to turn the announcing of columns and rows in Word 365 with Jaws 2019?
 
Thanks very much!
 
Sincerely, Vicky V            Hi Patti, Thanks very much for these instructions.  I’m just sorry to see that there apparently is no quick On/Off command for columns and rows.
 
Sincerely, Vicky VThanks, will do!
 
Sincerely, Vicky VHello Vicky,
 
There is a keystroke for setting column title reading in an Excel worksheet and one for setting row title reading.  At least, this is true for JAWS 2019 when using Excel 2013 but I think it should still work when using Excel in Office 365. 
 
To set column title reading move to the row that contains the column titles and use JAWS key with CTRL, Alt and C.  To use row title reading move to the column that contains the row titles and use JAWS key with CTRL, Alt and R.  After setting column and row titles every time you arrow up or down you should hear the row title and every time you arrow right or left you should hear the column title for the column focus moves to with the arrow keys.  They are not easy keystrokes but you can add keystrokes or they can be changed in the keyboard manager for Excel.  If you have a number pad then you might consider holding down the big insert key (JAWS key) and the CTRL key just to the left of the left arrow key using your right hand, and hold down Alt to the left of the spacebar perhaps with your thumb of the left hand and find the C if setting the column title reading or R for the row title reading. 
  
Several years ago, Freedom Scientific put out a DAISY book on why using the Excel naming feature should be used instead of using the JAWS method for applying titles to columns, rows or both columns and rows.  When using the Excel method anyone using Excel can take advantage of the naming feature as changes are saved in the workbook instead of in a JSI file as with JAWS.  The above keystrokes can be used but using the Excel naming method was recommended by Freedom Scientific in the training documentation.  If the worksheet is just for your use then using the keystrokes above will likely suffice but if you want more info on the Excel naming feature feel free to contact me.    
 
Take care.

brianllee@...Brian, is there a way to turn off columns and rolls off while using EDGE?
I’ve already tried insert 6 and did a default and attempted to set edge up to work well with JAWS.
But would appreciate the additional actual settings that what should be on and off for EDGE to be more blind friendly.
Very Thankfully Yours,
Ron KolesarThank you Brian.  These are the shortcuts I was hoping to hear about!
 
Sincerely, Vicky VHello Ron,
 
Here are a couple methods you can try to see if they do what you are wanting.  I am not currently using the chromium-based Edge browser but these steps will likely work.
 
To affect the speaking of such things as table row and column titles and cell coordinates try the following:
 
1.       Open the browser and use JAWS key with V to bring up the quick settings for the browser.
2.       Tab to the tree view and you should hear the “Virtual cursor options” item announced.  If the level is closed then use right arrow key to expand it. 
3.       Arrow down to “Virtual cursor verbosity level” and use the spacebar to cycle through the three choices.  Stop pressing spacebar when you hear “Low.”
4.       Press T three times until you get to “Table options.”
5.       If “Table options” is closed then use right arrow to expand it.
6.       Arrow down and you will find the current setting for layout tables.  Leave this set to ignore.
7.       Arrow down to Table Titles.  “Only marked headers” is selected by default.  Use spacebar until you get to the Off option. 
8.       Arrow down to Cell Coordinates Announcement.  If selected then the coordinates will be announced after the cell content.  Use spacebar to uncheck it.
9.       Tab to OK and use spacebar.
 
If you want to stop hearing table and grid information at the beginning or end of such elements you can do the following:
 
1.       When in the browser use JAWS key with 6 to launch the settings center for the browser.
2.       Tab to the tree view and then arrow down to Web/HTML/PDFS.  If necessary use right arrow key to open it.
3.       Press R until you hear “Reading” and if necessary use right arrow to open it.
4.       Use down arrow key until you get to “Web verbosity level” and you will hear that it is set to high, medium or low.  Use spacebar repeatedly to cycle among these three settings.  You might want to use “Low” to minimize the amount of speech feedback from JAWS.
5.       Arrow down to “Configure web verbosity levels” and if necessary use right arrow to expand it.
6.       Use down arrow to the level you chose.  “Low” should be the level you choose to get less speech when navigating. 
7.       When you hear “Low” with the ellipsis press spacebar.
8.       This brings up a list of preferences for when the “Low” verbosity level is set.
9.       Tap T until you hear “Table or grid” and press spacebar to uncheck it.
10.   Tab to OK and use spacebar.
11.   Tab to “Apply” and use spacebar, and then tab to OK and use spacebar again.
 
Take care.

Compatibility with Medical Charting Software 12 messages,"Hello JAWS Users,
 
I am a totally blind JAWS user. I will be starting a hospital residency in August. A requirement of this residency is to write charting notes in the hospital’s Electronic Medical Records (EMR), through the hospital’s secure IntraNet. The charting software used by this hospital is Cerner/PowerChart. Does anybody know about the compatibility of this software with JAWS 18?
 
Thank you,
 
Kelsi WattersI don’t know about that software in particular, but I know that most hospitals will not allow third party software access to patient information.
I work for a rehabilitation agency and our staff who deal with job site accessibility run into this all the time.
 
Have you talked to their I.T. staff to find out if they are willing to put Jaws on their system?
 
I hope they are and that the software won’t require thousands of dollars worth of scripting, but it probably will.
 
Good luck,
Richard

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss."" --Douglas Adams, from Life, The Universe and Everything, p.59I ran into this problem when doing my hospital internship. I was working with three different hospitals and none of them were willing to share with a third party. I was told that if it was a permanent work situation, maybe, but not for an internship.
 
The only solution I had was to get a reader who they approved, someone in the same program I was in, and have her enter into the charts whatever I told her. Not the ideal solution as her mistakes, if any, became my mistakes, but it was all I could do.
 
VickiI have never been in a situation to personally have to enter anything in hospital charts.
I work at a rehabilitation agency, yes, but my job is dealing with adaptive devices outside of computers.
I work with the people that get to deal with hospitals when these situations come up.
Like Vicki said, it is really hard to get them to budge if it isn't a permanent job, and even then, it is extremely costly if it can be done.
First step is to talk with the I.T. folks or at least, their HR department, since this is an accommodation issue.

So basically, what they, and other companies like them, are saying is: Tough cookies to you. We don’t care what the ADA says. Please forgive the pessimism.
JerryMaybe you could use AIRA to do so.
 I sure would not recommend going to the employer as a first measure.
The rehab agency has a responsibility to do what it takes to get people employed, and the state agency should pay for any scripting that will provide accessibility.
And if the state agency does not think that they should do that, I would go to a Client Assistance Program, which is the go-between for clients and the state agency.  If a state does not have a CAP program, then there should be a state ombudsman to contact.
But if the job would get someone off of SSDI, then they should be motivated to assist any way they can.
GlennYes.  That would be my first go to.  If this is a school project, make sure your school is involved with the jaunt to the state rehab agency. 
 
JustinThe sad reality is, assuming we are still talking about the hospital issue, is that no matter who is willing to pay for the scripting, if the hospital won't allow a third party software like Jaws on their client sensitive database, the only option is to either bring a law suit, or find another internship.
The State agency can bring all the standard arguments about the ADA, but if the organization says no, it will need either a law suit or contacting the Attorney General and that will take even longer. If the program is to start in 3 months, I doubt even if they were willing, scripting could be done by then.

It should not be this way, but it is.
I hope it gets worked out.

It is up to the state agency, if the person is a client, to approach the hospital and talk to their IT people and offer to hire someone to do scripting.
Glenn
 I'm not going to continue with this thread as it is pointless.
If the employer refuses to allow the software, even if it won't cost them a dime, the agency can do nothing.

Copying online text 5 messages,"Until recently I could almost always select a piece of text on the web and paste it into a document but recently this isn’t always the case, for example, I wanted to paste the details of a book I am reading into an e-mail to share with a friend but Amazon wouldn’t let me do this.
Is there a work-around?
AlisonThe way that usually works for me is to place a temporary place mark with windows control K and arrow to the end of the text and do insert + space and then press the letter M.
That selects it, and then you can copy it.
Note, you can put the mark at the end arrow to the beginning to, the main thing is that your cursor is at one end and the place mark is at the other.
I have done this when finding the spot again would be a pain, and I'm already at the end and it would be easier to backtrack to the beginning after leaving the marker.
GlennAlison,
If Glenn’s suggestion doesn’t work in this instance, try going to JAWS quick setting with JAWS key+v, then arrowing down to the “Select and copy” option. If it doesn’t say “from the virtual cursor,” press the spacebar until it does. Tab to Okay and press the spacebar again.
 Maybe, if the placemarker method does not work, you can save the page as text if it will let you then do it.
 
Then, copy and paste your material.Have you checked your settings to make sure you’re copying from the virtual cursor and bit on screen highlight?
 
This setting keeps getting shut off on me sometimes and I have to switch it back.
 
I just haven’t bothered calling FS about it since it’s a minor thing for me.
 
Open up a webpage, then press insert+V.  In the search field type copy and arrow down to select and copy from virtual cursor, though in your case it may say select and copy from on-screen highlight.
 
To change the setting, press your spacebar.  It cycles through the two settings.
 
Good luck.

Yes, Google Chrome works very well with JAWS 2019.?? Many JAWS users have switched to it as their default browser because it is faster and less cumbersome than IE and Firefox.

The only reason I don’t use it more often is that I have some privacy concerns. A few things do work better in FF also. Firefox’s main problem right now is that very large pages (even with nothing but text) take forever to load into the virtual buffer, sometimes crashing the browser altogether.
Anyway, no need to limit yourself to one browser. I have five on my system right now.

Early report on Skype 8.51's Split View and the Skype 8 JAWS scripts,"I now have Skype 8.51.0.86 running in Split View mode. I do not have the latest August update to JAWS 2019 installed yet. This message will provide information on using this new mode with my existing Skype 8 scripts, as well as
some general information on how the new view works.

First, for those who find that Insert+Q says Chrome scripts are loaded rather than Skype scripts when a chat window is in focus:

The following early suggestions are experimental and based on my brief experiments this evening and on
comments I have received from various folks.

You can try adding the following line to the [Domains] section of ConfigNames.ini in the JAWS user folder; but see notes below:

[Domains]
about:blank=skypeelectron

Doing this may cause the Skype 8 scripts to load in other places though, mostly in other web apps. This modification should not be required in JAWS 2019 as of the August update.

Then, some general information about how this view works:

When Split View mode is enabled, pressing Enter on a conversation list entry in the main Skype window opens the chat in a new window. Alt+Tab then works to switch among chats and the main Skype window. However, a new incoming
chat message will not open a new window; that will appear at the top of the Conversation list. You just have to go there to open the window for it yourself.

Hotkeys provided by Skype itself for jumping around in a conversation work in separate windows as they do in the normal view; e.g., Alt+Shift+e for moving to the Edit box.

Commands like Alt+1 for conversation list and Alt+2 for contact list only work in the Skype main window, not in chat windows. One way to jump to the main window is to Tab a few times from a conversation Edit box and press ""Open
recent chats.""

The rest of this message only applies to those for whom Insert+Q says that the Skype scripts are loaded. This assumes you are running revision 121 of my scripts.

The command sequences for moving to the chat edit and chat history areas should work in Split View mode just as in the normal view; e.g., [ e to jump to the edit box.

Typing indicators and announcements should also work as expected in split-view mode already, including the sequence [ t for announcing who is currently typing.

Insert+T will not say who is online, away, etc., or read mood text in a chat window, until I release a script update.

If you had to use the Index=skypeelectron and/or about:blank=skypeelectron tricks to make the scripts load, chances are that JAWSKey+v will bring up JAWS Quick Settings for Chrome rather than Quick Settings for the Skype
scripts. This is because of the way JAWS handles loading scripts for websites, as opposed to loading by application name. At this time, I suspect there is no easy way to fix that issue except by updating to the JAWS 2019 August
release.

Emails 7 messages,"Morning, all
Using outlook,jaws 2019 and w10. In outlook, when I copy an email to folder and delete  all jumk and other from the google folder the copies got deleted also. I thought if you copy the email to another folder they will be safe. Help.Hi Holger,
can you get them from the deleted folder?
I think people are mistaken about keeping messages in their junk and deleted folders.
Messages, unless they have attachments, take up almost nothing from your hard drive space.
A year of messages without attachments are seriously a drop in the bucket of your hard drive space.
Keeping messages is useful so you can search for messages for information, or in case you accidentally delete a message.
I have thousands and thousands of messages in my deleted and junk folders, I only permanently delete  them if they have an attachment, and once or twice a year I go in and delete them.
Hopefully you did not permanently delete them.
But to answer your question, did you copy them, or move them?
It may be safer to move them instead, because if you only copy them, Windows may assume that if you got rid of this message in this folder, you also don't want the copies.
And you can search all folders with shift + control + F with most eMail programs.
 
HTH.
GlennNo. I checked no all got deleted. When I was using another server provider for email, I could copy my email to another folder and delete the mail. Now with google is a major pain. It has so many folder that the same email gets copy in most of them. Would love deleting those folder that I do not need and just keep the one I created.
 What eMail program are you using?
Most have an option to remove from server after deleting.
You may need to log into the Google account settings to set your eMail preferences.
GlennI am using outlook in my w10.You may want to do alt + T and up arrow to options, and control + tab to the advanced page and see if your version has deleting options available.

The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any."" -- Alice Walker


I believe the best approach will be the CountIf function. You weren't specific as to whether you'll be filling out the spreadsheet and whether the number of questions will be consistent but let's assume you'll have a constant 20 questions and you'll be entering an uppercase Y for yes and an uppercase N for no. Let's also assume that you'll be entering these Y and Ns in cells B1 through B20. You could place the following formula in cell B21 to give you a count of the Y values:
 
=countif(B1:B20,""Y"")
 
If desired, you could place another formula in cell B22 to divide the result in Cell b21 by 20 to calculate your percentage. You can be as creative as you like and could use an If function to test whether the division is 80% or greater and even incorporate everything into one formula but the larger the formula gets, the more difficult it is to resolve any problems.
 
Good luck.
 
Alan LemlyI do not know what cell in column B your answers will start and end in.  But here is a formula that you can use.

=countif(b1:b20,""yes"")/counta(b1:b20) 

Now, you will have to put in the cells that are covered in column b for b1 and b20 that I put in the formula.
The formula basically counts each cell that has a yes in it for your cell range in column b, and divides it by the total cells that contain answers in your range in column b.

One more thing that you will have to do is to format that cell as a percentage so it will show as a percentage and not a decimal.

Hope this helps.

ChrisHello Steve,
 
You might try using the following formula.  You will need to change the cell designations.  The following formula assumes there is either a Yes or a No in cells B1 through and including B10.  You can use the following formula anywhere but for this example it is going into cell B11.  After using the formula you might need to use the keystroke of CTRL with Shift and number 5  in the cell where the result goes to change the cell formatting to percentage.  To try it out just copy the following formula and paste it into the cell where you want the percentage.    
 
=COUNTIF(b1:b10, ""Yes"")/COUNTA(b1:b10)
 
I hope this is what you are needing. 
 
Take care.

Excell question 7 messages,"Hello:

File Grouping 13 messages,"Hi Folks,
 
I just updated to Windows 10 version 1903, and my files seem to be grouped by date, or at least, the last time I accessed them.
 
The go by today, last week, last month and so on.
 
Can I shut this off, and if so, how?
 
I’ve looked through the view menu and it seems like everything is set like before the update, but I still can’t get it to look right.
 
Does anyone have any ideas?
 
VictorHi Victor,
 
This is because you need to change the, Group By, setting to, None, in the view menu.  While in a folder, let's use the Downloads folder as an example.  Press, Control + spacebar, so Jaws reports, not selected.  Open the context menu with the Applications key or Shift + F10.  Press enter on the, View submenu, choose what you want, list , details or... and press enter.  Open the context menu and open the, Sort By submenu, and press enter on your choice.  Now open the context menu and open the, Group By submenu, find, None, and press enter.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!Give the following a try;

 

 

The, Group By, in the View menu needs to be changed.  Try the following:

 

1. Open your Downloads folder, or, your documents folder, and press, Control + spacebar, to make sure nothing is selected.

2. Press the applications key or Shift + F10 to open the context menu.

3. In the View submenu press enter on, List, or whatever you want from this submenu.

4. Open the context menu again, open the, Sort By submenu, and press enter on, Name, or whatever your choice might be.

5. Open the context menu again, down arrow to the, Group By submenu, and press enter on, None.

That's it, you should be good to go.

 Hi Mike,
 
Thanks for this, it helped, byt only temporarily.  When I go to aply to all folders, it reverts back to the grouped items and changes the sort order to date accessed.
 
Any idea what’s going on?
 
VictorHi David,
 
Thanks for your message.  Please see my previous message for my current predicament.
 
Thanks again for the solution.
 
VictorIf you deselect all files in the folder, then do a right click and from the menu go the group by sub menu and select none
That should fix itHi Victor,
 
To be clear, are you attempting to apply the view to all folders while still in the folder with the issue and not from the Control Panel?
 
For example, after performing the steps outlined earlier in let’s say the Downloads folder:
 
press Alt+F
 Down arrow to “Options” and press Enter.
Press Control+Tab to move to the View page.
Upon moving to the View page you will be given the option to apply the view to all folders of the same type, press Spacebar.
Tab to OK and activate.
Finished.
I apologize if these are in fact the steps you tried. This is what I had to do to make the setting stick.
 
Good luck.
 
MauricioI’m still having the same problem. I can’t locate an option to set all folders to the same view like we used in earlier versions. In File Explorer I hear progress percentages and then my sort by choice is shown- but windows seems to be reconfiguring it when I open Explorer. But if I open my user name, downloads- the display reverts to the order by date thing after a while- which is making us all nuts 😉
 
CherAre you saying that you apply the view from within the folder you modified or from the control panel? Thanks.
 
CherOK,
Give the following a try;

 

 

The, Group By, in the View menu needs to be changed.  Try the following:

 

1. Open your Downloads folder, or, your documents folder, and press, Control + spacebar, to make sure nothing is selected.

2. Press the applications key or Shift + F10 to open the context menu.

3. In the View submenu press enter on, List, or whatever you want from this submenu.

if you've already have list checked then, leave this as it is.

 

4. Open the context menu again, open the, Sort By submenu, and press enter on, Name, or whatever your choice might be.

again, if you have name checked leave it as it is.

 

5. Open the context menu again, down arrow to the, Group By submenu, and press enter on, None.

here's where most likely the issue is, you can't find none in the list, so, while in the list, press enter on name, go back into group-by menu, arrow down you should find none press enter your done.

That's it, you should be good to go.
 
       The impossible is the untried,  Never under estimate the power of a dream.
 Yes, I have done this more than once- but has then reverted. Just tried to set all folders the same while in the downloads folder- will see what happens…
 
Cher
 
.Hi,
 
Yes, in the steps I outlined below, I never once go into the control panel; I stay within the folder, for example the Download folder, to perform all steps.
 
Mauricio.Hi Mauricio,
 
Yes, I am applying to all folders from within the folder itself, I am not going into the control panel for any part of this.
 
On the flip side, it has corrected itself, and I guess my settings finally synchronized with the cloud.
 
Perhaps the 1903 update wasn’t as flawless as we were led to believe.  LOL.

Filling out a .pdf form 4 messages,"I have a .pdf form requiring me to add information.  So far, neither JAWS nor NVDA nor Narrator will allow me to type into this form.  can it be done?
Good question.  I've had similar problems filling out forms of this type.  Hope there's an answer.--Matthew ChaoHi Ann,

Are you being told that it is actually a fillable PDF? Sometimes people format a form and then save it as PDF. They mean it to be printed and then filled in manually.

However, if it is supposed to be a fillable PDF, you might want to try Out Loud which is the Adobe text to speech reader. I am not at my computer, but I think you can find it under the ""view"" menu or the ""tools"" menu. The ⠧⠻⠨⠝ I have used in the distant past sounded awful, but if the file was formatted for its use, it is worth giving a try. Once you get it started, you will want to turn off JAWS because they will talk together which is realaly distracting. Out Loud does not have any braille support.

Good luck!

Filling out an envelope 14 messages,"Hi All,
I am using JAWS 2019 with the latest version, office 2016 and windows 10.
When I go to fill out an envelope, I pulled up a word document and than pressed alt plus m for the mailings tab than e for envelopes.
It says divelery address so I typed in the persons name and than pressed enter to type in the address but it doesn’t do anything.
I tried typing in their whole address and using the reading command but it just says envelopes and labels.
Any suggestions on how I can fix this problem.
Thanks in advance.
Kate WalshI have found Microsoft doesn’t play nice with their mailings tab, and stick with Avery all the way.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”
 I have Word 2010, not 2016, so I don’t know if this will work for you. 
If I want to print an envelope, I find it easiest to type the information in a blank document.  The return address goes at the top, not indented, then the delivery address several lines below, again not indented.
When I go to the mailings tab and then to envelopes, everything is already filled in, in the proper places.  I have the envelope inserted into the printer and all I have to do is tab until I get to print.  Some printers have an actual physical button to press to start the printer and sometimes there’s a continue button on the screen which you may have to alt-tab to.  Someone may have to show you the first time just to make sure the envelope is inserted as it should be and to make sure it printed properly.    
 How far do you indent for business size versus a small envelope?
Thanks
 Not unlike using a typewriter the way we used to back in the day.  I remember the spacing learned back then.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”
 If you’ve told Word what size envelope you have, Word will put the addresses where they need to go.  Writing the addresses in a blank document—no indentation necessary—is just a way to have Word fill in the edit fields for you.  You can always fill in the fields yourself from the mailings/envelopes tab.  Again, I just type in the addresses, no indentation required, since Word has a template for the envelope size you’ve selected.How far do you have to go down between the pieces of info on the page?I would say that with the built-in margins, you would not want to go down at all.Hey Judy, long time no talk or see, from Ron Kolesar Ham Radio Station KR3DOG-PA-WCECTM
I have a HP all in one printer.
When I insert a envelope, which is almost never these days when ever possible first.
I try to use a persons and or company’s e-mail address.
But do you place the envelope in length ways and if so, with the flap side up and or down and to the let and or to the right?
Also, or do you place it with ways where the flap is going across instead of up and down?
And the above questions apply to if the envelope is in length ways or with ways.
Very Thankfully yours, A lost friend Ron Kolesar Ham Radio Station KR3DOG-PA-WCECTM
Pennsylvania West County emergency Com-Tree Manager.
 I would just skip a line or two, as you would have done in the olden days when you were writing a formal business letter with both addresses listed at the left before the body of the letter begins.
 
Actually, if you’ve saved your return address, you don’t have to type that at all.  It will be filled in for you.
If you use the edit field in the mailings envelope tab, you don’t have to do anything but fill in the information:
Name
Address
City, State zip
Just pay attention as you tab through the fields and options on the way to the print button and follow the prompts.  This is not that complicated.  Smile.
 Hi Ron,
I am using Word 2007 on Win7, and Jaws 2019 and the envelope wizard works 
very well for printing envelopes.
Typically on HP ink jet printers,the envelope would go in
with the flap facing up and pointing to the right,
and on laser printers the flap would be facing down and pointing to the 
right.
Where the envelope is positioned in the paper tray will depend on the model,
in my old HP, the envelope was positioned in the right side of the paper 
tray oriented as mentioned above,
but in my newer printer, the paper has to be removed and the envelope guide 
must be used to center the envelope in the paper tray.

""Tomorrow's another day, another way!""
""and if tomorrow never comes, problem solved!""Hi, Ron, this is Judy.
 
Very sorry, but I am not remembering you from other than the e-mail lists.  I am from out west, originally Colorado Springs.
 
I was a “ham” a long time ago with WN0CGG while I was growing up, but we moved overseas with my Air Force father, and I had to give it up, as we lived in West Germany’s buffer zone.
 
Regarding the envelope, it will depend on your printer instructions, but I am guessing that the envelope would go in on the top of the printer tray lid, just inside those adjustable pieces.  It will probably go flap down and guessing again, lengthwise.
 
You’ll have to give it a try.  I am going to do the same, just for fun, haven’t tried it with our new laser printer.  I usually type all our envelopes.
 
Even at work, no one learned how to use our fancy-dancy printer/faxer/copier to do envelopes, and we all just typed them on our office’s IBM Selectric 2.
 
None of us ever thought of trying Becky’s idea of typing in a word doc first, and letting the mailings tab place the addresses properly.  None of us knew to do that. 
 
I should employ her technique also when creating labels.  We all just pulled up the mailings tab, then typed in the information, and it never worked.  I gave up and started downloading from Avery.
 
Thanks Becky!
 
Hope this works for you, Ron, and let us know how it goes.

Mike,
 
 I do not think this works in Notepad, but it absolutely does in MS-Word (and I just tested it using your example).
 
 You must use Advanced find and replace and you must check the checkbox for ""Use Wildcards"" after hitting the ""More"" button in the Find & Replace dialog
to make that checkbox visible.
 
 Using the following in the find field:       ([0-9]{1,}%)*^13
 
will find any line starting with one or more numeric digits, followed immediately by a percent sign, followed by any number of characters, followed by
a new line/new paragraph.
 
If you use nothing (leave blank) the replacement it will remove the lines.
 Brian
 
Mike's steps:
1. While in Word press, Control + H, to open the Find & Replace dialogue.
 
2. In the, Find field, copy / paste the string of text below:
 
([0-9]{1,}%)*^13
 
And do not put anything into the, Replace field.
 
 Using the above string of text in the find field will find any line starting with one or more numeric digits, followed immediately by a percent sign, followed by any number of characters, followed by
a new line/new paragraph.

3. With the above string of text pasted into the, Find field, press, Alt + M, to select / open the, Replace with more button.
You can also tab from the Find field to the Replace with More button and activate it with the spacebar.
 
4. Now press, Alt + U, to check / select the, Use Wildcards, checkbox. 
You can tab to this checkbox also, after activating the Replace with More button and it takes several tabs to get there.

Folder view in Windows Explorer 7 messages,"I finally got Windows 10 upgraded to version 1903 and I'm running the latest version of JAWS 2019.

Perhaps it was like this before I upgraded to 1903 and I just didn't notice, but the folder view for my downloads folder seems messed up. First, when I enter the folder, JAWS says something about ""today expanded"" and the files are not listed in alphabetical order. How do I change the view so that I get a detail view with the subfolders listed first in alphabetical order then the files, also in alphabetical order?

JeffWhile in that folder, hit alt+v then arrow right to details and hit your spacebar, then arrow right to group by, hit your spacebar and select name.

No, this happened in the 1903 update.  Try the following to put it back the way it used to be.
1. Open your Download folder and press, Control + Spacebar, to make sure you deselect anything in the folder.
2. Open the context menu with the Applications key or Shift + F10.
3. In the, sub-menu View, press enter on List or Details, or whichever option you prefer.
4. Again open the context menu and in the, sub-menu Sort by, press enter on , Name.
5. This is the biggie, again open the context menu and press enter on, sub-menu Group By, and press enter on, None.
You should now be back to the old way of the download folder display.

http://www.FreedomScientific.com/CertificationHi Mike, 
By using your steps, I can get my downloads folder back to alphabetic order.  I can not, however, find a way to save the settings.  Must I go through these steps every time I open the downloads folder?  It is no big deal since I can get it back to alphabetic, but I was just wondering.
 
JoanHi Joan,
 
This has been an issue for some and not for others.  Hopefully they'll stick after a few times.  What you can try is making these same changes in This PC first, then executing the steps again in the Download folder.

For Windows users: sharing a file using Skype from context menu,"Hi guys,
    I am not sure if this was the list were we talked about this
      topic but if not I think this info could be useful for someone.
    It is now possible to share a file via Skype starting from the
      context menu of the file in Windows explorer, especially if you
      have latest 8.58 Skype version. The difference as compared to the
      past is that now the menu voice is not inside ""SendTo submenu"",
      you just have an option called ""Share with Skype"" inside the
      context menu, just press enter on it an you'll get a box where you
      have to search for the contact to whom you want to send it.
    I am taking advantage to test the correct behaviour of this list,
      I am having some issues since this morning with other lists on

I don't know if this will help, but it sounds as if your Downloads folder is set for music.  Since you have no customize this folder in your context menu, you can get to it through properties, which you did list as being there!

When you press enter on properties, shift-tab once to get to the tabs list.  It should say general tab.

Right arrow till you get to customize tab and then press the tab key.  You should be in a combo box that will let you optimize the view for the different folders, documents, music, pictures, etc.  I have my downloads folder set for documents view.

You can tab to okay when you're done.

Now open your downloads folder and press the context menu key with no folder or file selected.  See if you have the view menu with the sort by and group by choices available.

You can always call the MS Disability Desk since this is more a Microsoft issue rather than a JAWS issue. 

I hope this is of some help.

Hi Mike,

The instructions you provided that will turn off these functionalities
in Word. What if I want to keep these functionalities but stop JAWS
detection?

There are settings available, but there are not working it.While focus is on a word document, go into the JAWS settings center with JAWS key+6 in the numbers row above the letters. When the search field appears, type ""spell"" without the quotations. Then arrow down through the options.Gary Ray here.
 
Please note that I am running Office 2010.
 
I was able to fix this in Word 2010 using the directions given.
 
I have my Outlook 2010 set to use Word as the editor and was getting the same problem as in Word.  The Option changes for Word did not carry over into Outlook
 
I went into the Options for Outlook under the Mail tab and was able to get corrections made so I no longer have the problem in creating new email messages.  If I had to list the exact steps I used, I would be in trouble.
 
I’ll be changing to a different Office version in 2020 so as long as I can keep it working as in the past, I’ll be happy.  I have no idea if these changes in JAWS 2019 will mess with Excel or Power Point.
 
It appears that JAWS is switching some of the setting functions from inside JAWS to the MS product one might be running.  God only knows what it is doing to other Office versions.  My Office is getting close to extinction so I cannot really say.
 You might try the following.  Why it works I have no idea but I had the same problem with the setting not stopping the grammatical error detection.  I set the Advanced Grammar and Proofing checkbox to the checked state, used apply and OK and the detection of grammatical errors stopped.  I went back into the settings center, removed the checkmark, used Apply and OK and the grammatical error detection did not resume.  After unloading and reloading JAWS as well as restarting my system the feature still worked as you would expect without the grammatical errors being detected.
 
Take care.

Google Chrome crashes 12 messages,"Hi,
So far nobody has been able to duplicate this situation.  I'm posting it here to see if anybody has suggestions.
While downloading using Chrome several weeks ago, the application would finish downloading and I could do a say line to hear the current line but nothing else when I moved around.
I had to use task manager to close down Chrome.
It happened with all three screen readers on my desktop, JAWS, NVDA andn Narrator.
I wrote to Google Disability thinking it was Chrome.
then with the next JAWS Private Beta build the problem went away only to reappear about ten days ago.
I wasn't sure if it was indeed a screen reader problem or something in a recent Google update.
this last Thursday with the newest Private build of JAWS, the problem went away again.
the problem is that JAWS and Google updated about the same time so I don't know if its Google, a screen reader conflict or maybe both.
So far Google hasn't been able to come up with a solution or even duplicate it.
And if JAWS, NVDA or Narrator are involved, where would I go from here?
Would the JAWS logs show FS anything?
Has anybody else experienced this?
I especially see it with BARD and other websites from which I download.
I'm using the latest JAWS private build and Windows 10 update as well as Chrome Version 76.0.3809.87 (Official Build) (64-bit)
I just tried an experiment and went into About for Chrome and got an update this morning.
And with the latest Chrome build which just updated as I wrote this message, I have another Chrome Crash.
When I go into task manager to get rid of Chrome, I also see a message which says:
AdBlock has crashed. Click this balloon to reload the extension.
Sometimes its another app or extension that has crashed so it is not always the same one.
I can use Chrome Canary and have never seen this crash happen.
Any ideas as to what is causing this and how to solve it?

Subject: [jaws-users] Google Chrome crashes

Hi,
So far nobody has been able to duplicate this situation.  I'm posting
it here to see if anybody has suggestions.
While downloading using Chrome several weeks ago, the application
would finish downloading and I could do a say line to hear the
current line but nothing else when I moved around.
I had to use task manager to close down Chrome.
It happened with all three screen readers on my desktop, JAWS, NVDA
andn Narrator.
I wrote to Google Disability thinking it was Chrome.
then with the next JAWS Private Beta build the problem went away only
to reappear about ten days ago.
I wasn't sure if it was indeed a screen reader problem or something
in a recent Google update.
this last Thursday with the newest Private build of JAWS, the problem
went away again.
the problem is that JAWS and Google updated about the same time so I
don't know if its Google, a screen reader conflict or maybe both.
So far Google hasn't been able to come up with a solution or even duplicate
it.
And if JAWS, NVDA or Narrator are involved, where would I go from here?
Would the JAWS logs show FS anything?
Has anybody else experienced this?
I especially see it with BARD and other websites from which I download.
I'm using the latest JAWS private build and Windows 10 update as well
as Chrome Version 76.0.3809.87 (Official Build) (64-bit)
I just tried an experiment and went into About for Chrome and got an
update this morning.
And with the latest Chrome build which just updated as I wrote this
message, I have another Chrome Crash.
When I go into task manager to get rid of Chrome, I also see a
message which says:
AdBlock has crashed. Click this balloon to reload the extension.
Sometimes its another app or extension that has crashed so it is not
always the same one.
I can use Chrome Canary and have never seen this crash happen.
Any ideas as to what is causing this and how to solve it?

That is near the bottom, I don't recall if you have to expand

I think Chrome is also checking for malware.

I've had instances of Chrome crashing on my PC, but doesn't happen that
often.  Either it won't resolve and I'm unable to navigate or all of a
sudden it disappears and I am at my desktop, or wherever I was before I
opened up Chrome.

GlennHi.


I've had Chrome just disappear a time or two in the past few months, but nothing directly related to downloads. If this is only happening when you download something, I wonder if what ever Antimalware utility you use outside of Chrome is causing this when it scans the file as soon as Chrome unlocks it, or perhaps before Chrome unlocks it, and that's stirring up trouble somehow. I wish it wasn't that intermittent. How are you going to know if what changes you make is actually a fix? If you do figure out how to crash it every time, maybe try it once with external Antimalware disabled temporarily to see if it still happens?


I'm running normal non development Chrome and I do have Ad Block Plus installed in it. I also have Chrome Sounds and a couple of other extensions enabled. I guess it might be worth uninstalling or resetting your Chrome and, if you sync your Chrome with your google account, not syncing it again until you've tried to reproduce the problem a bit.

Group Guidelines,"Hello all. It's that time again, where a reminder is sent out  once a month regarding the rules so here they are.
 
Hello to all.  Hear is this month's reminder of the Skype English rules. taken right from the welcome message
 
Hello and welcome to the Skype English list. Here our goal is to have fun discussing various things related to skype and the screen 
readers such as jaws and others.  Remember the following:
 
1. flaming of any kind, virus warnings, spam, or anything off topic will not be tolerated.
 
2. Posting in HTML is aloud, but no links will work. The message will hopefully be converted to plain text. Let me know if you see 
any attachments. i doubt you will.
 
3. Absolutely no attachments are aloud on this list. Security comes first and this will minimize the chance of viruses spreading.
 
4. Keep all intro threads to at least 3  or 4 messages before the thread is taken off list. That way we don't drift off topic. I 
know this is going to be hard for most of us including this mod here but if we keep the  messages on topic the archives will look 
a lot cleaner and people will be able to find info on what they need.
 
5. speaking of clean archives absolutely no discussion of anything other than Skype and its use with screen readers will be tolerated on this list.  If the admin notices any other topics such as google talk on this list they will close the thread immediately. I hate to do this but this is to keep the archives easier to find for old members as well as new ones.
6. When you first join this list it's normally customary to send out an intro message.  Since this list is growing by leaps and bounds this will cease and desist.  The new comer will now  if they want to send out a question regarding the scripts, skype, gw connect, anything that this list covers. any ""hello"" messages and ""I'm new. here is my info"" messages will no longer be tolerated.  We want to keep the searchable archives at the mail archive as clean as possible.
 
7. Before you post your question(s) to the list,  please search the group archives or do a google search. This prevents the cycle of repeated messages. It also teaches you the user to search before asking for help. Oly when you have exhausted yoru resources should you come to this list. We get a lot of messages, so the archives are full of stuff dating back to at least 2005.
 
. Have  fun and happy skyping.
 
 
Failure to abide by any of these rules, especially the last one, will get you 3 strikes then the member is band from said list.

I recently figured out though, that when I go to Skype's download page I get version 8.68 once again. There is an hotfix for the Mac version, but in Windows the situation is like I described. Do you have some news on it?

I already had Skype 8.68 installer so I decided to downgrade for now, and when I go to check for updates I get the message saying that I have the latest version.

Has anyone had experience with sig tags and Jaws?,"
I just first heard about them this evening, and I am curious. There is a lady on another e-mail list I am on who creates them and customizes them for people, and I was wondering if any blind people are doing that, can do that, and how it is done. 
 
Since I’ve discovered emojipedia, I love the imagery and creativity.  How far can blind people and software take it?

Speeking of word processors,

I've grabbed it, it looks like its a fork
 of open office, but to my surprise its indeed accessible for all the
work I've done on it so far and its snappy as I liked.
I haven't used it heavily to give a fair compare with MS office, but
sure enough it worth every penny.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Hi Judy,
This might be interesting however, there are some free open source options too, like Libre Office  and Open Office.
Thanks.
GlennTrue, I hadn’t heard of this one before and was just curious.
 
Thanks.

Help with jaws. This is urgent. 9 messages,"My computer was working well Wednesday night and I shut it down and when I restarted it yesterday all sound was dead.
I was running windows 10-1809 and the jaws latest June update. I have called Microsoft support 6 times already they did all the troubleshooting they could and still no sound but everything showed that it was working except the sound service was dead. Finally they updated my computer to 1903 and then I had sound again but I can’t get jaws to run on it no matter what I do. I can run narrator fine now I have uninstalled jaws and all the programs associated with it and Microsoft even cleaned the registry and we have re installed jaws several times and even tried a jaws repair but jaws comes up and says there are missing files please re install this program. I
Even called freedom scientific support and got no help there. I would like to know if anyone else has had this problem and if so what did you do to fix it.
I have done all I can to fix this and I am still stumped, if anyone can help me with this I would really appreciate it very much.I had a similar problem not with JAWS but with installing Office. Microsoft disability desk tried for several hours to get it installed but no go. This happened right after updating to Windows 10 1903. Finally I did a reset of windows and after that all went as it should. I installed Office in a few minutes. I think something happened with the first upgrade to 1903 and the reset fixed it.When you did this, did you do the keep files, or remove everything?I am resetting everything now and removing all files I don’t know exactly what Microsoft did but I am in the reset process now and there should be nothing left on it but windows.I kept the files.
I kept the files the first time and it still did the same thing so now I am getting rid of everything.Hello Loy and mike, thank you both for your responses. I had to reset the computer twice but the last time I installed jaws it came up working.
There must have been something in the files causing the problem because the second time I removed everything and that finally did the trick so thank you both very much and you can bet that will be a lesson not soon forgotten.Glad you got it working. In my case Microsoft disability desk worked on my computer remotely on three different occasions, a total of over 6 hours. Then  they got a more advance tech person and he is the one who told me to reset the computer and everything worked after that.Well. keep it mind friends. whenever you uninstall anything from your computer few files of that software are still remain in your computer registry. in order to completely remove the files you need to clean up your registry too. if you are not experience with registry configuration then you must use any software which provides you advance uninstall rather then using windows native uninstaller.

How Do I Get JAWS Out of My List of Open Windows? 6 messages,"Hi,
I know this is a really basic question, but I don’t know the answer so I’m asking here.]
When I alt-tab through my list of open windows, I keep having to go through JAWS Home Use. I’ve tried minimizing that window, but that doesn’t work.
Could someone tell me how I can get JAWS Home Use out of my list of open windows when I alt-tab through them?
Thanks much.
EvanI always wished Freedom Scientific would make this option the default, but it's not, but I always find it an annoyance when working on people's computers when they have not set Jaws to run from the system tray.
To fix this, alt + tab to the Jaws window, and do alt O for Options, and enter on basics, and tab to run from system tray, and check it with the space bar.
HTH.
GlennHi Evan,
 
Run Jaws from the system tray.  To do this try the following:
1. Alt + Tab, to the Jaws window or press, Insert + J.
2. Press, Alt + the letter O, to open options or if you pressed, Insert + J, press the letter, O.
3. Press enter on, Basics.
4. Tab to, Run Jaws from the system tray checkbox unchecked, & press the spacebar to check this box.
5. Tab to, Okay, press enter to save your change & close Jaws options
6. Restart Jaws or your computer for the change to take afect.

This is the same as a right mouse click.

 usually if you are inside the application, JAWS key plus q tells you what script version you have.
I don't know if this is universal or if it depends on the individual who wrote the scripts.

That is the way it works with scripts I have written by Jim Snowbarger for Sound Forge and Brian Hartgen for numerous script applications.

How to Have JAWS speech at Start-up and Shutdown 21 messages,"Stanley, while the Jaws start message is mostly consistent, you’ll find the Jaws speech at Windows shut down is hit and miss.
 
I know this as I’ve been using Jaws since 4.5, about fifteen years now.
 
The only way I knew when Jaws was shutting down was when my computer shut down and Windows XP did it’s chime thing.
 
Since then, what you described is hit and miss for me.
 
For example, I just saved a draft of this message, re-started my computer and went back to the message, and I had no indication that my computer was re-starting, nor that Jaws was shutting down save for my computer fan whirring around in the background.  That fan certainly is consistent, certainly not the Jaws speech at Windows shut down.
 
VictorHi All,
 
As I mentioned earlier, try installing, Stascom, it'll let you know that your computer is both starting and shutting down reliably.  Note: Don't use IE11 to access this link, but use any other browser.  I couldn't get the webpage to open using IE11.

No one has more to say than the woman who says she doesn't want to talk about it.Hi Mike,
 
I just read the description of this program, and a great deal of the information sounded familiar.
 
Did this utility used to go by a different name?
 
Perhaps in the old Windows XP days?
 
I also think David had it up on the website under Windows Utilities.
 
Am I correct?
 
VictorHi Victor,
 
I learned about the Stascom Suite several months ago and just installed it to try it out a couple of months ago.  If it was introduced as far back as XP I don't have a clue.  If it's on the Jaws-Users website I don't have a clue as to what it's called, but it's not under the, Utilities, heading as, Stascom, or at least my search didn't find it using the Stascom name on the Programs page.
 
Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!Hi Mike,
 
No, I think David might remember this, but at the time it was on the Jaws users page it wasn’t called Stascom, it was called by another name, as it maximized windows, provided shut and start up sounds and a whole host of other enhancements to the sound scheme.
 
It’s been a while, at least ten or more years-ago.
 
VictorHi Victor,
 
Stascom doesn't provide start or shutdown sounds, but it informs you what it's doing via a verbal message by a voice you pick.  It doesn't add anything into the, Control Panel / Sounds Link / Sounds Page.  The same voice you pick will deliver any message that is delivered by the Stascom program.  This program is based on the selected voice rather than a sound picked via a sound scheme / Media folder.  There are other voices available.  By default it uses the default Microsoft voice, which is in Windows 7 MS Anna and I forget what the default voice of Widows 10 is, maybe David?.
 
Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!How do you change the voice it uses?Does this program load automatically at start up??? Does it have a System Tray icon??? Or do you have to open it before shutting down to hear its shut down announcement???

Description of hotkeys and user preferred modifier keys 
list of 4 items
• The default modifier key for the Stascom hotkeys is the control key. Should you experience a clash with another program on your system, the modifier
set can be changed to either Alt or Alt+control. This option can be accessed with the hotkey for the Configuration Manager, modifier+7, then choosing the
entry pertaining to hotkey modifier selection. Stascom has a bypass key, modifier+0, which will suspend all Stascom hotkeys for five seconds. This enables
the user to use a hotkey in another application without the need to change the default modifier or unload Stascom for the active session. An additional
option is to disable the home row 1 to 0 quick access hotkeys under the general category in Configuration Manager. 
• When using either Alt or Alt+Control as preferred modifier set, the word count hotkey is excluded from the quick access home ro. This is due to technical
reasons beyond the scope of this document. However, when using a modifier other than the control key, the word count feature can still be accessed from
the program dashboard, modifier+backslash. 
• It is also worth mentioning the purpose of the desktop and start menu shortcuts. If the program was unloaded during any given session, these shortcuts
will launch the program. If the program is already active, it will open the dashboard interface from where all features and configuration options are available.
 
• The table below lists a complete list of the key bindings with their associated actions. If you have left the modifier key on its default, the word ""modifier""
refers to the control key. Else, replace ""modifier"" with the alternative you have selected, as described above.

If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!No, TweakUi was for all users, and I think it was a MS product.
This is for the Blind, for the most part and Stascom does not allow for the amount of tweaking that TweakUi did .Hi George,
 
Do you have the Stascom program running?  This is the default keystroke to go to the Stascom configuration manager.

If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!Hi Rick,

No, I don't think so, it was something you could add on to your computer that ran in the system tray, made sure all your windows were maximized, and had special announcements that let you know various things.

I'm sure it'll come to me at some point.  LOL.

VictorHi Victor,
I don't recall what it was right off,
was it available for XP and those versions of Jaws?

HTH,

""Tomorrow's another day, another way!""
""and if tomorrow never comes, problem solved!""Yes, it was, and it first appeared on the website where the lady died and David migrated her stuff over to the Jaws User's site.  Now it's bugging me, as it was a great addition for the blind and screen readers in general. Sheepish Grin.

VictorI believe it was Debbie Scales you're talking about, and I think her website was possibly, JFWLite, or something like that.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!The lady was Debbie Scales, the site was JFWLite

How to Have JAWS speech at Startup and Shutdown 2 messages,"Hello Everyone:
 
This is Stanley Haupt from Lehighton, PA. I have been using JAWS since Window-Eyes was discontinued. I started with JAWS 18, JAWS 2018 and JAWS 2019.
 
On this list there has been some email discussion about having JAWS speak when starting and turning off your computer. I have the box check to start JAWS at the Log-in screen. The start JAWS box for all users is not checked. The final step is to run JAWS for this user always.
 
It takes my computer fifteen seconds to start. JAWS says JAWS Professional.
 
When I do Alt-f4 to shut down JAWS says JAWS for Windows. That message let’s me know that the computer has shutdown properly.
 
I am the only one in the household who uses the computer.Also check ‘the start JAWS box for all users checkbox.

How to change the download folder back 2 messages,"Hi All,
I know this has been posted numerous time and I thought I saved the instructions on how to change the download folder back to the way it was before my pc downloaded Windows 1903. I cannot find those instructions. Can someone please give me those instructions to change the downloaded folder back to the way it was in 1809. Thank you in advance.
Mr. EdGood to hear from you.  Salt River is probably not an option, unless our guitarist Leona can get that time off for a morning performance.  She works in Newfields and may be able to come in late.  I'll have to check with her.
Cost is $200, if the bassis can do it and $150 for the three of us. 
The harmonica workshop would be a good fit.  We've done it at about 40 libraries in N.H. and everyone learns aa couple tunes.  The harmonicas are $3 apiece.  This is a special deal that we get from the Hohner codmpany abnd we make no money on them.  You can read about the workshop and Salt River at our website:
www.harmonicaworkshops.com
The workshop can be done either morning or afternoon.  
Let me know what you think, after checking us out.

my cell:  207 376 8178

Thanks.

Mike

Are there any settings and options of which I should take special note when installing and running Skype Desktop Version 8.54? Thank you in advance. Bill Whitebillwhite92701@...,,,,,1,54,60.76,2.75,86.01,77.5,13.5,24.07,81.48,62.96,50,11.11,9.26,7.41,0,1.85,0,0,1.85,7.41,3.7,5.56,14.81,11.11,3.7,5.56,0,20.37,1.85,3.7,0,0,0,0,11.11,0,11.11,0,0,1.85,3.7,0,7.41,0,3.7,3.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.56,3.7,1.85,3.7,0,0,3.7,1.85,0,0,0,0,1.85,0,0,1.85,3.7,0,0,3.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.56,7.41,0,1.85,5.56,0,0,0,3.7,1.85,3.7,3.7,0,0,0,0,0,20.37,16.67,0,1.85,0,0,1.85
Is it worth learning the adaptations for a laptop or instead buy an external keyboard with a numpad? 43 messages,"Hi everyone,

I am beginning to learn JAWS, having used Zoomtext as my reader for many years.

I use a laptop which does not have a numpad.

The JAWS support page offers an audio tutorial on how to modify my keystrokes for a laptop.

Would you recommend that I teach myself these modifications or instead purchase an external keyboard with a numpad which plugs into the laptop by a USB port?

Thank you in advance for any assistance.

Regards, Michelle BernsteinHi Michelle,

This is really one of those personal preference things. However, if you are only going to use your laptop with JAWS and you haven't been using JAWS on a desktop computer, then I think it would be just fine to learn and use the laptop settings.

When I got my laptop, I bought an external keyboard with a numpad because I also use a desktop here at home and a ⠙⠑⠎⠅⠞⠕⠏ when volunteering. I know I'm a wimp, but switching all the time between the two layouts would have made me go silly!

Good Luck!

DebbyI too use an external full size desk top keyboard with my Lenovo laptop.
Back when I originally learned how to use JAWS; they taught me on a full size desktop keyboard. Although today; I wish I’d of learned on a laptop keyboard. I’ve tried learning the laptop keyboard, but I just don’t have the patience.
People probably think I’m nuts; when I’m traveling with my laptop in its laptop bag; with a full sized desktop keyboard sticking out of it! But whatcha gonna do?There are only a few differences between using the laptop & external keyboard, mostly the insert key.  If you can get used to that, I’d recommend sticking with the laptop.  You’ll probably be mostly using a laptop from here on in.  Attaching an external keyboard to it is clunky if you can & still want to see the screen. 
 
You might be able to find an external numeric keypad which would be smaller & could sit right next to your laptop. 
 
Sherry WellsI also have an external full size keyboard connected to my Asus laptop.

Being blind, I turn off the computer screen.

Turning off the laptop screen saves on electricity and power.

But, this Asus laptop does not have an on and off switch.

I found out the keyboard shourtcut, Function key plus F7, turns off the laptop screen.

This shortcut, Function key plus F7,  is done on the laptop keyboard.Hi Michelle:
 
It is a matter of personal preference, I can only tell you what I, as a long-time JAWS user, do.  First, I always use laptop keyboard configuration, even on my desktop and full keyboard, which allows me to use the keystroke CapsLock+I to read the line the same as Insert-UpArrow on the numpad, but I am used to have my right hand on the numpad since I began using JAWS in 1989, so on my laptop I normally use an external keyboard with numpad.
 
HumbertoHi Michelle,
I actually don't use my number pad that much, and when I use my laptop, there is a command for routing the jaws cursor.
But the thing I like about a desktop keyboard over a laptop one is not the sometimes lack of a number pad, but the closeness of the keys on a laptop.
The function keys on laptops rarely have separations between the three groups of four keys.
So for my laptops, I use loc dots on specific keys.
The keys I put them on are:
F4 F8 F12
3 7 0
tab F G enter
windows key and application key
These specific keys allow me to find my way around as quickly as I do on a desktop keyboard.
GlennHi,
 
My first laptop did not have a numpad, so you will be fine.  I had that laptop and successfully used for six years.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Hi, Debbie and All,
 
You’re reminding me that when I started to work, the computer I had was not a laptop, but I liked the convenience of the Jawskey being the caps lock, so kept the laptop settings on my desktop, and enjoyed the convenience of either using the numpad or caps lock, depending on what the other hand was doing at the time.  It worked out very well having the best of both to hand.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”I had no intention of learning laptop layout when I switched to JAWS.  However, if memory serves correctly, I want to use caps lock as an alternative JAWS key and this did not work as I wanted it to when in desktop mode.  I turned on laptop mode and have really found it quite intuitive as someone still relatively new to JAWS.  It’s like your right hand is sitting on the numpad already, so you just get used to thinking of your right hand sitting there and the position of the keys is the same.   So, if a command says to use insert and the numpad 5, I just think of how my hand would be sitting on the 4, 5 and 6 keys on the numpad and hit the corresponding key on the querty part of the keyboard.  Hope that makes sense.  It was easier for me than trying to remember that same command as insert k. I think that laptop layout should be the default, since I think most people like having that extra functionality, and most people don't understand that they wouldn't even know that it was on until they needed that extra functionality.
And the having to double-tap the capslock is probably a plus for poor typists anyway, because poor typists often inadvertently press the caps lock more than better typists do.
GlennI love how you can simultaneously use the laptop layout on a desktop computer with keyboard with number pad.  You have the best of everything to hand.  For those of you with a number pad keyboard, switch to laptop layout and you will still have your number pad functionality, plus the caps-lock Jaws key when convenient.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Hi,
 
I was a typist long before computers were on the scene and long before I had my first laptop in 2007.
 
One time, when typing on a greeting card on our IBM Selectric, I accidently double-tapped the caps-lock on the typewriter hahahaha.  Muscle memory really does work, even when you don’t need it to.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”I always wanted a selectric, but they cost more than I want to spend on one now adays.
GlennThey are wonderful, and wedidn’t get ours until the nineties, when the college my hubby was working for was warehousing all theirs.  We had one given to us because they were trying to get rid of them.  I wonder how many offices or institutions of learning have some mothballed somewhere.
 
At work, we still had our Selectric 2 we hung onto and still used in the office from time to time.  For me, it was a great tool for writing on sticky notes, making out office deposit slips, etc.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Yes, you don’t need a numb pad the lap top keyboard is easy to use and learn. In fact I much prefer it . You can do most selections without moving your fingers from the keyboard home typing position.Well what else can you do? ignore them. (smile) I know how that feels. I used to use a laptop that I’d borrow from the testing center at school. Their keyboard didn’t have a numpad which made using the screen reader rather difficult. Eventually I had to switch to a full pc. The only reason I had to use the laptop for a while was because there were issues with getting the screen reader software installed on the pcs, that is, until they had changed their policy. Now all computers have screen readers, in the library, computer labs, Etc and I no longer have to deal with those scronny laptop keyboards. So basically, just do what you feel you have to do and ignore those who poke fun at you about carrying around an external keyboard.
 I don't know why anyone would prefer to navigate with the number pad, it's a longer reach than the four arrow keys.
But it does take a concerted effort to make the change I know, because I too used to carry around a desktop keyboard with a laptop, but it was mostly for the bigger spaces between the keys than it was for the number pad.
But it is good for the brain to learn to adapt.
I'm sure I could adapt to laptop keyboards without dots on some of the keys if I had to.
GlennOh yes, very doable, and quicker to adapt than you might think.
 
It is true you don’t have to move your hands, as much off the keys when using the laptop layout, but I also like hitting the insert key with the arrow-up, right there together when wanting to read current line.  Otherwise, I mostly use the laptop layout, and use the desktop layout when the keycombinations I need are close to the num pad.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Judy,
With laptop layout I use caps lock plus up arrow to read current line.

"Issue With WINDOWS 10, EXCEL And JAWS 2 messages","Hello,
 
I am using the latest version of JAWS 2019, with Microsoft Office 365 on a WINDOWS 10 Lenovo Yoga 530 Two-In-One Laptop. I believe that the WINDOWS 10 Build is Version 1809.
 
Whilst most of the Office 365 apps work brilliantly with JAWS, I have an issue with EXCEL. When I open an existing workbook, or choose to start with a blank workbook, JAWS announces the cell reference, with any cell contents, when they come up, as expected. If I use the arrow keys, to move to an adjacent cell, that is also read with any relevant content. If I then use the arrow keys again, everything goes silent and I can arrow around the sheet as much as I will, without any feedback from JAWS. This issue happens consistently. If I access the ribbon etc, that is spoken fine, however, when I go back to the sheet itself, nothing is verbalised.
 
I have not changed any JAWS settings, in respect to EXCEL and am bewildered why this issue is present. I use another Lenovo laptop model at work and do not have any issues, albeit I am still using WINDOWS 7 there.
 
I have written to VFO and am still awaiting a response a week later.
 
Has anyone came across this issue and, if so, were you able to fix it, either permanently or by finding a workaround?
 
Many thanks in advance, for your feedback. I am based in Scotland, United Kingdom.

J2019 & Soundcards 4 messages,"Hi All,
 
Running Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit with J16 thru J2019 all the latest Jaws builds.  For whatever reason J2019 will not read the names of my soundcards in either the, System Tray / Speakers / Playback devices or the, Control Panel / Sounds / Playback devices.
 
When I arrow up / down to highlight / select a soundcard to work with Jaws won't read anything, just announces, Speakers.  If I route the Jaws cursor to the PC cursor is the only way Jaws will read the soundcards by their correct names as Realtek or Soundblaster.
 
I've tinkered with screen resolution and made sure the screen was maximized, but J2019 is the only Jaws version that I have installed that won't identify the soundcard names at all, just reports speakers for either soundcard.
 
All input and advice will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks mooy moocho.

If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!Hi Mike,
Did you try going left and right?
I know in control panel in some other devices, they are left and right and if there are like 4 or 5, it starts a new line, which you would find with down arrow.

JAWS Shutdown Sound 28 messages,"One of the most annoying things about running Windows 10 is that there is no shutdown sound to indicate that your computer has shut down like in previous versions of Windows.?? The only reliable way to determine for sure that your computer has shut down completely is to listen for the internal cooling fan to stop spinning, which is not always possible, especially with a laptop whose internal fan may emit little or no noise.?? But the next best thing would be to have JAWS issue a shutdown sound whenever you close it manually or you shut down your computer.?? Is there any way to assign a shutdown sound to JAWS??? That other unmentionable screen reader has a shutdown sound, so I don't see any reason why JAWS couldn't have one, also.


GeraldAccording to this How To Geek article, you have to now edit the registry to get the exit windows sound back.
Up to you if you want to do this, but this is the link to the article I found:

There's no way I'm hacking the registry just to get a shutdown sound.?? This isn't rocket science.?? If Open Book can have a shutdown sound, there is no reason why JAWS can't, either.


GeraldPerhaps contacting Freedom Scientific directly would be the next step?

Windows has fixed it so the only way to get a Windows shut down sound is to hack the registry.  Or, perhaps contacting Microsoft would also be the next step if having a shut down sound is that important.

I have an SSD drive and hear nothing, but to make sure the computer has shut down, I just check that the external CD drive won't open.

If one doesn’t have a CD drive, then I can see where this gets annoying.

Good luck,
Richard

I thank you although it doesn't bother me that they are no longer there, the fact that I can put them back sounds like a challenge I would like to take.Hi All,
 
Take a look at this little program, Winaero Tweaker.  It can do many tweaks without adding anything to your computer.  It takes hidden settings that are there by default and either enables or disables them and explains exactly what the tweak does if you click on the provided link.

No one has more to say than the woman who says she doesn't want to talk about it. So, you trust this person to change your registry for you.
Other than changing Windows 10  registry, I don’t know how this software would reveal hidden settings.

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss."" --Douglas Adams, from Life, The Universe and Everything, p.59I tried it and still no shut down sound.Once you enable it you have to assign what sound you wish to use. It seems to work so far for me.You are correct in that program does work. It has been a long time, but those how to geek articles always impress me quite a bit. So either way is fine. It is I forgot about that program.Hi Gerald,
You are making a comparison of the operating system versus an application.
Jaws and Openbook are both applications,and if neither are running at the 
time Windows shuts
down, you would still not have any indication that Windows is doing so.
So, adding a shutdown sound to Jaws would not be a reliable indicator.
On my systems, when I execute a shutdown command , Jaws notifies me that 
Windows is shutting down and I am about to be logged out.

HTH,
Rick Justice

""Tomorrow's another day, another way!""
""and if tomorrow never comes, problem solved!""I wonder if a jaws script could be written for this.
GlennWhen I shut down the computer with NVDA running, I hear the NVDA unload sound, and if I did not exit NVDA, that means the computer is shutting down.
GlennI tried as well and no go.Exactly.?? So if a shutdown or unloading sound can be incorporated into this alternate screen reader, I see no technical reason why JAWS couldn't include one, also.



GeraldTwo thoughts, those of you who did the registry fix, did you then assign a sound in your sound scheme?
Do you have fast startup checked? That may nullify the sound settings.
Those comparing other screen readers exit sounds with Jaws, as Rick I think it was, pointed out, Jaws says something about exiting since the screen reader is dumped before the system finishes shutting down.
I have had situations where something else was blocking shut down, so even if Jaws or anything else had a sound, it wouldn't have helped.
Hence my method of checking the CD drive, or if no CD drive, then plugging in a usb device might get a sound.
The bottom line here is that only Freedom Scientific can say if a shut down sound can be added via script, or anything else.
Just my opinion.

Hi Richard,
 
Rather than speculating, have you tried going to the website and reading about how it works?

No one has more to say than the woman who says she doesn't want to talk about it. Hi Gerald,
 
Another program that you could run is, Stascom.  It will tell you when the computer is starting and shutting down amongst many other features.  One of its features is Maximizing targeted windows.
 
From: Richard Turner
Program features
list of 18 items
• Battery status on laptops is reported automatically while disconnected from charger,  while charging, or both. The notification intervals  are configured
in the Configuration Manager. As can be expected, this feature and associated  options  are hidden on desktop computers; 
• Contact Manager, including  yearly customisable audio and text birthday reminders for listed contacts. Alert options are either audio and text, text
only, or disabled. If set to audio and text, the audio alert will be repeated after 15 minutes (by default), if a reminder is not acknowledged. The interval
can be changed to  half hourly, hourly, or disabled in Configuration Manager. This module is mainly for the benefit of users who do not have access to
a smartphone, or possibly those who prefer the flexibility and simplicity of the Stascom alternative. The current version does not feature importing contacts
from an external file source such as csv; 
• Reminder Manager with audio and text alerts, with optional repetitions on a future date. Audio alert sound can be changed if desired. The same customisable
options as with birthday reminders, are available. See above; 
• Calculate day of the week for any date between 1 January 1601 and 31 December 9999; 
• Maximises application windows automatically. Window title exceptions can be specified ; 
• Prevents mute status on default sound card automatically. Recovery volume is configurable; 
• Low volume correction on default sound card (disabled by default). Minimum and normalise levels are configurable; 
• Two schedules and output percentage for automatic volume adjustment can be specified (disabled by default); 
• Password Generator, creating a unique, very strong 10 character password with each keystroke. Generated password can be copied to clipboard optionally;
 
• Time announcements on the hour,  half hour and  quarter hour. Individual hours can be specified, or disabled altogether.  Custom audio chimes are optional
if preferred over the included sound clips; 
• Accented and other special characters  can be easily inserted with hot keys; 
• Alphabetical list of 51 Windows applications and settings quickly accesseible with a hot key; 
• master volume level increased / decreased   by 5% with hot keys, ascending / descending tones to indicate the volume adjustment; 
• Word count for selected text in commonly used editors and browsers, with an option to place the result on the Windows clipboard. This feature is not
supported in some editors and e-mail clients with non-standard cursors. The results are more accurate than in most similar packages, as it ignores all
punctuation and special characters; 
• Program configuration can be reset to installation defaults; 
• Report generator, providing a summary of program settings and system information in HTML format for easy navigation; 
• Choice of three sets of modifier keys to use with Stascom hotkeys. A bypass key suspends Stascom hotkeys for five seconds. Should the user wish to disable
the home row 1 to 0 hotkeys altogether, this can be done under the general category in Configuration Manager. If these keys are disabled, all options can
still be accessed through the program dashboard, activated with modifier+backslash.

No one has more to say than the woman who says she doesn't want to talk about it. Good call Mike, I didn't even think of that.
But since I had to rebuild my system, I haven't gotten around to reinstalling Stascom.

JAWS Skype for Dekstop scripts no longer functioning after skype update,"Hi.
The subject generally explains what I think has happened. Yesterday I invoked skype as I normally do (unusually for me, I actually have a hotkey for this), and, the user account control came up. I saw a quick “setup” screen, and the programme seemed to be updating. I feel like it wasn’t a major update because I seem to remember being on skype 8.51.something previously. Anyway, now it says, Skype 8.51.0.72, which it says is the latest version.
I’m using JAWS 2018, and as well as the native JAWS skype scripts, I had installed scripts from http://www.dlee.com, which add a little bit of extra functionality and keyboard commands.
Now, none of the scripts are loading. When I check with insert-q, JAWS announces that the scripts for “Google chrome settings” are running. I understand skype for desktop is now a chromium-based application, and if there were no scripts specifically designed for skype, this is exactly what it would say. But these scripts were all working fine until last night.
The programme is slightly usable without scripts, but it’s not great. Braille display does not track in message history (and increasily I like working with speech off so I can more comfortably listen to music or whatever). I have to keep remembering to hit insert-z to turn off the virtual cursor when typing.
Another weird thing, which may be related, is that  the first time I invoke skype, now, the programme activates, but seems to be minimised. I have “run in background” turned off in settings; in fact, my actual skype settings don’t seem to have changed at all.

Canberra, Australia.Well…this wasn’t happening to me before yesterday. And, I do not have JAWS 2019, else I would likely be using it.The latest JAWS 2019 update apparently fixes this issue, which occurs in Skype 8.51 (dated 12 August 2019).
 
I suspect older versions of JAWS, including 2018, are affected also; but the fix is in the latest JAWS 2019. So your best option is to upgrade to JAWS 2019 and try it with that version.Hi.

"JAWS Skype script revision 220 released, to fix issues in Skype 8.82","As I mentioned in another thread on this list, Skype version 8.82 came out on Friday or so and broke a few
things in my scripts. Notable among these was the typing indicator sound, which began playing constantly in
all chat windows. I released a temporary fix yesterday (Saturday) but now have a full release for everyone.

Go to https://www.dlee.org/skype/#hist to read the release notes. The download link, as usual, is on the same
page. Note that this update should only be used if you are running Skype 8.82 or later. Running this updated
script revision with an older Skype version is likely to cause a few things not to work as expected.

One extra bit of good news: A few of you a while back reported that Alt+1 did not work to move to the
Conversations list when a group chat was in focus. This is because Alt+1 is a native Skype keystroke and it
did not work in that particular circumstance. In this revision 220 of the scripts, I finally scripted around
this so it does work in that case.

Happy Skyping.

"JAWS Skype script update, and next step plans","I just released JAWS Skype script revision 197 at https://www.dlee.org/skype/

This update just fixes a few chat handling issues and adds the key sequence [ B for reading the current Skype
Credit balance when available on screen. (Chat issues fixed include JAWS saying ""Region"" or ""List item"" and
failing to announce when crossing over a date.)

My plan for the next Skype release is worth mentioning ahead of time...

I plan to make my Skype scripts work with the Vispero scripts in your current JAWS version instead of
replacing them. This has several side effects:

1. The features supported will vary based on your JAWS version.

2. The minimum JAWS version I support will be JAWS 2018 instead of 17.0, because older JAWS versions supported
the obsolete Skype 7 application with scripts of the same name, and we don't want to run those with mine. :-)

3. Some of the features, and hopefully any new features Vispero adds, will start working whether you use my
scripts or not.

Again, the above list of effects should apply to my next release, not the release I posted today.

The reason I waited this long to do this is that it is difficult to support Vispero scripts without requiring
them, and I did not want to move the minimum JAWS version up too fast.

JAWS Startup and Shutdown 2 messages,"Hello Everyone:
 
This is Stanley Haupt from Lehighton, PA. I did recheck the different settings for starting and shutting down JAWS. It does say JAWS Professional when JAWS comes up talking. If I select Alt-F4 JAWS says Shut down Windows. I hit enter and the computer shuts down. Thanks to those who sent me email about this feature for JAWS. I now have all the settings checked. Start JAWS at the logon screen checked, Start JAWS for all users checked and Start JAWS for this user always.
 Stanley,
It is not that we don't know when Jaws is shutting down, it is that in windows 10, there is no shutdown sound for some folks.
But some people relied on another screenreader making its shutdown sound to know that windows has closed it for shutdown.
However, to your example, I have tried to shut off Jaws, and sometimes it takes a long time to shut down and I have to alt + tab around to make sure it is actually unloaded.  So Jaws does say it's shutting down, but it would be nice to know when it is actually unloaded.

JAWS and Endpoint management System Software 10 messages,"Hi group,
 
My wife is a med. transcriptionist and she uses JAWS 2019 latest with a Win 10(version 1809) operating system. her current employer is asking her to install Endpoint Management System software and she is wondering if anyone on this list has used Endpoint Management software and if it interferes with JAWS in any way? Endpoint Management is a security software that incorporates anti virus, anti malware and lots of other security features onto the computer system and my wife fears if she installs it on her computer that it will screw up her system. Anyone out there have any experience with this software and JAWS?
 
thanks in advance,
Marvin Atkins Marvin, I’m afraid I don’t have any experience with this software, but I want to be sure that, in addition, you ask not only Vispero, but also Endpoint. Sometimes software companies will tell you if they’ve had experience working with screenreader programs. Some will even offer to help if the user encounters problems. It’s in their interest to be accessibility-compliant.Adrian,
 
yes, I fully intend to contact Vispero and Endpoint to see what they say before my wife atempts any installs. I also have a backup laptop where I can install the software to test it before installing on my wife’s work computer. I do not believe JAWS will work with Endpoint’s interface but it is all the background activity we are worried about as far as interfereing with JAWS is concerned. I was just curious if anyone out there had any experience with Endpoint. Thanks for your response.
MarvinMarvin,
I work at a large bank and Symantec Endpoint is installed on our laptops.  I am also on Windows 10 and using JAWS 2019.  I have not experienced any issues with Endpoint.  It’s just kind of there doing it’s thing and I never pay any attention to it.   I see the icon in my system tray, but that’s it.
 Robin,
 
Thanks for this good info. May I ask, do you use Outlook at work? My wife is currently using Outlook 2010 and is another concern of hers.
MarvinI am on Outlook 2016 at work.  I think we also used Enpoint when I was on Outlook 2010, but I was also on Window Eyes at that time.  I’m a heavy user of Outlook and have not seen any issues.  Occasionally I may have a delay as an email is opening, but I cannot say if that is Endpoint or just a general thing.  Given al that I read on this list, I do not believe that any weird quirks I have with JAWS are related to Endpoint, since others seem to talk about the same quirks.   
 
RobinThank you Robin, for all the great info. Hopefully, things will work as well on my wife’s system as on your system.
MarvinHi Marvin,

The laptop I received from my company had Symantec Endpoint Protection installed on it, and as Robin said, it just kind of runs in the background.  I haven't noticed any negative impacts from it being on my laptop.  I use Outlook on the web, Word and Excel, the ServiceNow change management application, puTTY to access servers, and Skype for Business, all on a daily basis.

Pam

Marvin,
I work at a large bank and Symantec Endpoint is installed on our laptops.  I am also on Windows 10 and using JAWS 2019.  I have not experienced any issues with Endpoint.  It’s just kind of there doing it’s thing and I never pay any attention to it.   I see the icon in my system tray, but that’s it.

Subject: [jaws-users] JAWS and Endpoint management System Software

Hi group,

My wife is a med. transcriptionist and she uses JAWS 2019 latest with a Win 10(version 1809) operating system. her current employer is asking her to install Endpoint Management System software and she is wondering if anyone on this list has used Endpoint Management software and if it interferes with JAWS in any way? Endpoint Management is a security software that incorporates anti virus, anti malware and lots of other security features onto the computer system and my wife fears if she installs it on her computer that it will screw up her system. Anyone out there have any experience with this software and JAWS?

thanks in advance,
Marvin Atkins

JAWS and sound forge 9 messages,"Hi,
A friend wrote me with a problem.
I think I remember this problem coming up a while ago but don't know how it might have been resolved.
Any suggestions?
He says:  I am having a conflict with jaws 2019 and sound forge 11 on my pc.  I have a sighted engineer friend who notice that if I open sound forge 11 first then jaws 2019 I will have speech and I can use sound forge 11.  If I open jaws 2019 and then sound forge 11 my jaws speech will disappeared and I need to reboot my pc to get jaws  back.  My friend believes that Jaws and sound forge are fighting   over the sound on my sound card.  What can I do to fix this issue.

John again, I can confirm his problem but have not encounterd it myself.
He is using windows 10 latest version.
We installed the latest sound forge drivers today.

http://www.FreedomScientific.com/CertificationHi John,
 
Is Sound Forge a self voicing program?  I've heard of it, but don't know what it does.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!I don't think SF is self-voicing.
Did you go into Jaws settings and try selecting a different sound device for Jaws?
I usually bring up the settings by pressing enter on the Jaws icon on the desktop.
Go to utilities and down arrow to sound card and try checking another device by pressing enter on one that is not checked.
Also, be prepared to call up Narrator or another screenreader if things go silent when you do this, so you can go back and check another one.
GlennSound Forge is a powerful but expensive audio recording, editing and mastering software. The SnowMan has jaws scripts for it and anyone interested to purchase can learn more about it at:
http://heartofiowa.net/~snowman/scripts.html
find more about Sound Forge at:
https://www.magix.com/us/music/sound-forge/That would only help if he has another sound source to feed jaws through.It shows two in mine, and I only have the one device inside my computer.
GlennHi Glenn,
 
That's because 1 is Windows Default and the other is the soundcard brand name.  They're both the same soundcard.

Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)Hi Glenn,
 
Try switching from one Realtek  selection to the other, but beware you might lose sound.  The 2nd Realtek selection probably has something to do with settings for other soundcard functions.

JAWS becomes irregular with pending Windows 10 update 5 messages,"Windows 10 Creators, 1809 (OS Build 17763.615)
JAWS 2019.1907

This morning I was entering a report at a website when JAWS would not open an Edit field no matter what I did.
I minimized my work & moved back into my computer where JAWS was not announcing Icons on my Desktop and when I moved to the Task Bar & Tabbed it would not announce the icons there either.
When I finally managed to activate INS + F4 I noticed the selections were preceeded by ""Update"" then Shutdown or Reboot.
This has happened to me at least 2 times before when a Windows update comes in and is painful and a time waster to say the least.
Any ideas what Windows 10 is doing to me and a possible fix I can do so that a pending update does not make my JAWS go wonky>?

GeorgeHello George,
I’ve had the same type of issue from time to time. It’ actually will happen with any version of windows or screen reader. Unfortunately, there’s no real way to stop this. All you can really do is save any open documents, do the reboot, and once you’re all logged back in, reopen everything and go on from there.
MikeHmmmmm sounds like something on the list of things FS should fix. I've not seen this. How ever what I have seen is that now sometimes for what ever reason Windows blocks the shut down because it wants me to save my work. lol Like it can't tell JAWS is a screan reader and there's no need to save nothing nor shut JAWS down.

GeorgeHi george,
 
Try going into Windows Updates and Security and under the Updates tab go to the, Change active hours, or the, Advanced options.  Between these 2 you should be able to get the updates to come down when you're not using the computer.
Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.If you are using OneDrive, GoogleDrive, or some other cloud storage, shutdown will be blocked because these “drives” haven’t been updated. You just tell Windows to shutdown anyway. It’s a Windows thing, not a JAWS thing. +1 for FS… at least, not a -1!

JAWS script update released (was Re: Skype is unified! Skype UWP for Windows 10 is now the same as Skype for Windows Desktop! Here's what will happen and what to do.),"I have released revision 173 of the JAWS scripts for Skype, as promised in an earlier message I sent here today. That message is quoted below for reference.

The new URL for JAWS Skype scripts is https://www.dlee.org/skype/

The ""electron"" part is removed, though for some time the old URL and all references thereunder will still work, via an HTTP redirect.

Please read the Revision History entry carefully for this release. A direct link is https://www.dlee.org/skype/skype.htm#hist

In particular, there are specific installation instructions there for this update, which is because this update effectively replaces two sets of scripts at once: scripts for Skype for Windows Desktop 8, and scripts for
Skype UWP for Windows 10.

Final notes of potential interest:

If you are migrating from Skype for Windows Desktop to the newly identical Skype for Windows 10, check your settings (Ctrl+Comma), because settings from one version may not be automatically applied to the other even though
the interfaces are the same. I recommend paying particular attention to where Skype says your audio will come from and go to.

If you use the BXUpdate feature of BX to update scripts, run through the installation instructions for this Skype script update for this one; do not try to use BX to update the scripts. That doesn't work when the URL
changes, the script name changes, and the scripts replace two different sets of Skype scripts at once. :-)

JAWS scripts for Skype updated to address the ChromeLegacyWindow issue,"I said I wouldn't, then I did...

Skype script revision 178 is posted at http://www.dlee.org/skype/

This update includes the same sort of automatic fix that I put in the scripts for Microsoft Teams a few months ago. When Skype decides to act evasive and throw the ChromeLegacyWindow announcement at you, the scripts should
catch it, interrupt it, announce ""Fixing window structure,"" and promptly fix the window to work normally. This should hold until Microsoft fixes Skype itself, as I expect they will just as they did for Teams.

There are other minor updates in this revision, detailed as usual in the Revision History section of the above page.

Hi Richard,
 
Running Windows 10 Pro & J2019, the only time my shortcut keystrokes don't work is when Malwarebytes is running.  MWB has this window called, Malwarebytes Tray Application, that, for lack of a better term, lays over the top of other screens, but the weird thing about this page, or whatever it is, is that it's invisible to the sighted people, but is seen by screenreading programs.  Several months ago I demonstrated this fact to a nonbelieving MWB tech support person by the way of a screen shareing session and they were able to get rid of this page in Windows 7, but not in Windows 10.  I've read about others with the same issue you're having and I do hope they join in with you since not being able to use your shortcut keystrokes can be very irritating.

I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Hello Mike.
 
Interesting info there. I have Malwarebytes myself, but disabled all the features, and just ran it as an on-demand scanner. Recently (earlier this month) my PC builder took my machine and put everything in a new, much bigger case, and installed an SSD for my system drive. While doing so, he updated Malwarebytes and now it’s the fully functional trial version again, which has this “tray application” thing that you mentioned. I hear it come up when I first start the computer and the desktop comes up. However, it does not seem to be interfering with my shortcuts. I had to test this just now as I hardly use them at all anyway, but, all does still seem to be working here.
 
I’m running Jaws 2018, though. This seems to make a difference, somehow.
 
 Hi JM,
 
While on the Malwarebytes Tray Application window you can press Alt + F4  to close this window and it will also take MWB out of the system tray as well, but it doesn't stop MWB from running in the background, updating, or doing scheduled scans if you were running the pay for version.

Jaws Announcing Selected Text 5 messages,"Howdy All,
 
Running Windows 7 & 10 pro with J16 thru J2019 latest.  When selecting all the text in a text / Notepad file Jaws used to report how many characters wer selected, but not any more.  What or where do I need to go to find this setting so I can get this function back?  All help will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks mooy moocho.

I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Mike,
 
I’m guessing this isn’t the answer, but just in case. Notepad, Windows 10-1809, latest release of JAWS 19.
 
Whether JAWS reports the number of characters selected depends on which text selection level I choose. I will be told the number of charazcters if I select all (control-a) or from focus to end of text (shift-control-down arrow). However, if I select with just shift-down arrow, JAWS does not give me this information.
 Hi Adrian,
 
When selecting all text with, Control + A, is where I used to get the total amount of characters reported, but I'm not getting the number of characters no matter which keystroke I use.  I don't know when Jaws stopped reporting character count for sure, but it most definetly happened within the last couple of months.  Thank you for your input.

I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Mike,
I think what she is saying is that it still works with Jaws. I don’t know if you may have changed something that cause it to stop for you. I just went to a document and it works the same for me as for Adrian.
MarieHi Marie,
 
With Word documents Jaws reports correctly, but in text files it was not until I changed something this morning.  I'm not sure which setting I changed, but Jaws is now reporting character count in text / Notepad files the way I like Jaws to report.  Thank you for your input.

Jaws Uppdate 2 messages,"I just installed the update with no trouble.
They still haven’t fixed the issue where jaws reads punctuation when it is set to none.
 
Pastor GilHi Pastor Gil,
 
Where do you have punctuation set to, None, and it's not reading correctly? Read the note below.
 
Note:
This is a note on the difference between changing punctuation settings in Jaws quick settings, Insert + V, & customize punctuation in the Settings Center default all applications.  They work backwards from one another.
 
When setting punctuation in Jaws quick settings, this controls the amount of 
punctuation JAWS will speak / recognize.  The default setting is most.  To hear less 
punctuation spoken you would select some or none.
 
When making changes in the customize punctuation list, this basically tells Jaws how much of a selected punctuation mark to ignore.  If you do not want
Jaws to speak/recognize a particular punctuation mark you want to choose the
"" all "" selection.  You will have 4 radio buttons to arrow up or down
through.  They are none, some, most, & all.  In these selections they work
backwards than what you would think.  For example;  If you choose "" none ""
for the dollar sign, Jaws will speak / recognize every dollar sign in
whatever you are reading.  On the other hand, if you choose the "" all ""
radio button, Jaws will not speak / recognize any dollar signs.
 
Summary:  In short the Jaws quick settings tells Jaws what punctuation to recognize / speak, & in the Settings Center default all applications / Customize
Punctuation settings, tells Jaws what punctuation to ignore / not speak.  Hence, they work backwards from each other.
 
Hope this helps some of you understand the differences between the 2 
punctuation setting options.

Jaws and Removal of Tables 11 messages,"Afternoon all.
 
Using Jaws 2018, Windows 10 on a Dell laptop, I am trying to remove a series of tables, along with its text, from a Word 13 document. I know that this has been discussed previously, but I cannot remember the process. Any help in this will be helpful. Please forgive the sometimers.

“If you ask my opinion, I will use five dollar words, and expect four dollars and eighty five cents in return change.”
 Hi,
Did you try to select it, and pressing the del key?
HTH.
GlennYes. Now there is another problem. Within some of the tables is text that I need to keep. So, what is the process for keeping the text, which I know is contradictory to my previous inquiry. Sorry.If you use the  temp place marker, you can put a place marker and go to where you want to stop selecting and press insert + space bar and the letter M, and that selects up to where you are, then you can press delete.
To get to where you want to stop selecting, just use the normal navigation keys before you press insert + space bar and then M.
HTH.

Sorry.Okay ... so what is the temp place marker, and will the steps provided keep the text? Thanks for the reply.Also, maybe I didn't mention it, but control + windows + K places a mark.
GlennIf you copy/paste the Word doc into Notepad, the table formatting will go away but the information will be saved.

In Word, while in the table, press alt+j, then l, then v to remove the table structure but leave the text.Anne:
I followed your instructions, but could not get it to do what you said it would, so I am going to shut it down for the day. Thanks for the suggestions.Hello Jerry,
 
Here are a couple methods that you can try.
 
If you have many tables in the document you can list them using JAWS key with CTRL and T.  After doing so use down arrow key to find the table you want to work in and press enter to move focus there.
 
With the cursor located in the table press the Alt key to move focus to the top part of the ribbon.  After doing so press J followed by L followed by V. 
In the resulting “Convert table to text” dialog box you can choose how to replace the column dividers.  The default is by using tabs.  If you want to use a space instead of a tab then choose the down arrow key to the “Other” radio button.  Press spacebar when focus goes into the edit box. 
Tab to OK and press spacebar. 
 
If your keyboard has a number pad you can do the following:
 
Move focus into the table. 
Use JAWS key 3 (the number above E).
Immediately use Alt with the number 5 on the number pad.  This selects the entire table.
Use CTRL X to cut the selection.
Without moving the cursor immediately use the application key and move down to the pasting options.  Arrow right to the Keep Text Only option and use enter key.
 
This second method is quick but the tabs are still left.
 
You can then proceed to select and delete the text you don’t want to keep.   
 
If after pasting and keeping text only you want to get rid of the tabs you can select the text that you pasted and use Find and Replace.  After selecting the text use CTRL with H.  In the Find What box use a caret with T (that is shift key with 6 followed immediately with 6).  Tab to the Replace With box and press spacebar.  Tab to the Replace All button and use spacebar.  Word will tell you it has finished with the selection and ask if it should check the rest of the document and you can answer “No.”
 
Take care.

brianllee@...Hello Jerry,
 
I noticed an error in the message I just sent.  When you use the Find and Replace dialog in the Find What box use caret with T, (that is Shift with 6 followed by T).  I accidently put that it is Shift with 6 followed by 6.  Here is the revised message:
 
Here are a couple methods that you can try.
 
If you have many tables in the document you can list them using JAWS key with CTRL and T.  After doing so use down arrow key to find the table you want to work in and press enter to move focus there.
 
With the cursor located in the table press the Alt key to move focus to the top part of the ribbon.  After doing so press J followed by L followed by V. 
In the resulting “Convert table to text” dialog box you can choose how to replace the column dividers.  The default is by using tabs.  If you want to use a space instead of a tab then choose the down arrow key to the “Other” radio button.  Press spacebar when focus goes into the edit box. 
Tab to OK and press spacebar. 
 
If your keyboard has a number pad you can do the following:
 
Move focus into the table. 
Use JAWS key 3 (the number above E).
Immediately use Alt with the number 5 on the number pad.  This selects the entire table.
Use CTRL X to cut the selection.
Without moving the cursor immediately use the application key and move down to the pasting options.  Arrow right to the Keep Text Only option and use enter key.
 
This second method is quick but the tabs are still left.
 
You can then proceed to select and delete the text you don’t want to keep.   
 
If after pasting and keeping text only you want to get rid of the tabs you can select the text that you pasted and use Find and Replace.  After selecting the text use CTRL with H.  In the Find What box use a caret with T (that is shift key with 6 followed immediately with T).  Tab to the Replace With box and press spacebar.  Tab to the Replace All button and use spacebar.  Word will tell you it has finished with the selection and ask if it should check the rest of the document and you can answer “No.”
 
Take care.

brianllee@...Hi Brian, I too have been looking for a way to get rid of tables but keep the text. Your second option works great for me.

Jaws and Word 13 Really Weird Issue,"Morning all.
 
Using Jaws 2018, MS Word 13 and Windows 10 on a Dell laptop, I experienced a really weird issue.
 
As per the posts on creating addresses for labels, I wanted to test the theory outs. So, I took a blank document, typed in the return address, went down a few lines, typed the destination address, then pressed alt m. This brought up the mailings tab. I went down to envelopes and pressed enter. Jaws stopped speaking, and word shut down.
 
So, I reopened Word, went through the process again, JAWS stopped talking for a few minutes, and then jaws came up stating JAWS was installing. So, I let it go through its process, and after a few minutes of nonaction, I shut down my laptop. Then I restarted it, and everything is as it was before the start of this merry-go-round. Any ideas/suggestions as to why this is? Again, really weird.

Jaws friendly laptop 32 messages,"List, my Toshiba laptop is in need of replacement.
Have any of you on the list recently purchased a new 15.6 inch screen laptop computer that works well with jaws?
I would like another laptop that has a built in keypad.
Also, has jaws worked well with the new solid state drives?
Thanks for any help.
Like many of us using jaws and access technology for the last 28 years, can remember in the past being sure we got a laptop with the right kind of video card and audio card.  That said my current Toshiba was bought off Amazon with standard video and audio card.
Again, thanks for any ideas or suggestions.
John in sunny southwest FloridaJohn,
I really don't think any of the variables you are considering will be of concern.
Jaws will work on pretty much computer running Windows.
The thing for you to be concerned about is the form factor of the computer and if you are comfortable with it.
GlennWell the layout of the keys can differ. As for the keypad thing. Only once and that's on my Dell Enspiron 3840 desktop have I run into the issue of not being able to use the num pad as is for JAWS. It doesn't even have the on and off key. But than again it is a business config.

John in sunny southwest FloridaJohn,
That is what I meant by form factor.
Jaws will work fine on all computers, but there are factors such as the F-keys requiring the FN key to do some of the tasks that we typically do, and I think that on the laptops where this has happened, usually that feature can be turned off in the BIOS, but perhaps someone can let you know if they haven't been able to turn that off.
I think it is important to put my hands on a laptop before buying it.
For example, my wife has an Acer where all the keys touch and there is no easily discernable distinction between all the keys, just lines where the level keys touch.
Even with dots on it, I hate it.
But we ordered it from Best Buy a long time back and I had my brother pick it up and I met him in another town when we could do so, and I would have never picked this laptop for my use, but that is what happens when you buy one """"feel untouched"" you might say.
GlennAlso, especially if you are considering HP, make sure you can change the behaviour of the function keys, as HP sets them to act as hardware function keys. Most of them have an option in the bios to switch this, but some do not.John,
I should add that I am not knocking Acer laptops.
I have another Acer laptop here with Windows 7 and I love the layout.
I think Acer makes a great laptop.
I like Dell's laptops, but I think that their desktop computers are crap in my opinion.
Dell hasn't done well with good driver support for its hardware in desktop computers, and I don't think they have the best components.
But their laptops seem quite good, as far as quality.
But all manufacturers make different models and they are always changing, and if someone is looking for a new computer, it is pretty hard to ask for opinions on brands and models, as most people with a computer that can tell you about it, are using one a year or more old, and this won't help you in your search, since they are changing all the time.
So if you do order one ""feel untouched"", ask about the separation of the keys, and what the F-keys do by default, and if it is not what you want, if that behavior can be changed in the BIOS.
Also, it wouldn't hurt to get on-line and read some reviews of computers and based on that, call the store or the manufacturer and ask them about the form factor.
HTH.
GlennThe solid state drives are wonderful. My new dell desktop has one, as does my slightly older Dell laptop. I’d never purchase another computer without one.
 one thing to watch out for with some computers is you can not turn off the number pad because they do not have a number lock key. which most screen readers need before they can use the keys for there mouse functions.My first laptop didn’t have a num pad, which in retrospect was probably a good thing, because it mae me learn the alternative Jaws commands.  I found that I really liked that setup better than the traditional keyboard.
 
Once I went back to the keyboards with num pads, I still kept the laptop layout since I liked it so much.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”I like that the solid state drives are faster and more reliable, but I don't like that you can't hear them booting up.
Often you are wondering what the computer is doing, if it is booting up, and you can't tell non-visually with solid state drives.
But again, this is a factor that has no bearing on Jaws. 
I do care about the audio on some laptops, some laptops, sold as business models, at least in the past, have had terrible sound.
But now that we use laptops in the business world for things like Power Point and the like, perhaps poor quality audio is becoming more of a rarity in laptops.
This is something you might find out about by reading reviews on models on-line, before you decide.
GlennMy husband remembers the day I couldn’t stand Vista when it first came out, but I only remember really liking it over all.  I had Windows 7 at work.  I really never liked Windows 8, but 10 is much better.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Good point.
Which reminds me, I would also look for the ability to turn off the monitor, not all laptops do that.
 
GlennYeah, this is an issue that makes me leery about buying a computer with an SSD.?? Because an SSD emits no noise like a mechanical hard drive, it would be almost impossible to tell for sure that your Windows 10 PC has shut down successfully because there is no shutdown sound like in Windows 7.?? Sometimes, you might hear ""JAWS for Windows"" when the shutdown has initiated, but there is no reliable way to tell whether it has powered off unless it has a DVD drive on which you can simply press the eject button to tell whether it is off.?? Also, I have read that although a solid state drive may be more reliable as a mechanical hard drive, it may not last as long because its memory cells tend to wear out over time and eventually become unusable with repeated write cycles.?? Is this true?



GeraldHi Gerald,
I think that the write cycles depend on how the computer is used.
I almost never reboot my computers, they run 24/7 and this would be better for an SSD, because the Swap file is not rewritten over and over as it is every time you do a complete shut down and start up.
I think leaving the computer running is better for mechanical hard drives too.
Glenn
Yeah the write thing only matters if you write lots of stuff to the drive. So most gamer laptops at least only use the SSD as a boot drive. Desktops like the special XPS's from Dell do this as well. This maybe a problem with the real cheep 300 and $200 laptops that only have that SSD.Hi Gerald.

this is an issue that makes me leery about buying a computer with
an SSD.?? Because an SSD emits no noise like a mechanical hard drive, it
would be almost impossible to tell for sure that your Windows 10 PC has
shut down successfully because there is no shutdown sound like in
Windows 7. Sometimes, you might hear ""JAWS for Windows"" when the
shutdown has initiated, but there is no reliable way to tell whether it
has powered off unless it has a DVD drive on which you can simply press

Your computer is shutting down when speech disappears. You can also pay attention to the sound of its fan. When the fan stops blowing, your system has shut down entirely.

Also, I have read that although a solid state drive may be more 
reliable as a mechanical hard
drive, it may not last as long because its memory cells tend to wear out
over time and eventually become unusable with repeated write cycles.?? Is

I've never heard this.. Both my solid state drives have lasted three years so far.

Geeks that do rediculious tests that may not reflect the true punishment avrage Joe will give or in this case won't give the PC. Gamers are these people. Gamers do punish their PCs.I have heard both pros and cons about leaving a computer on all the time.?? As you say, it is probably less stressful on a hard drive to leave a computer on all the time.?? On the other hand, leving it on all the time generates heat, which could shorten the life of other components like the mother board or processor. And of course, leaving a computer on all the time will increase your electric bill, which in my case is already ridiculously high, like over $200 a month in the summer when I'm running my air conditioners. So I prefer to turn off my computer at night when I'm not using it.

Jaws losing focus with Skype for Business 2015 running,"Hi there
 
I’m new to this list, have no idea to do an archive list and can only hope this question hasn’t been addressed before.
 
I am required to be logged into an open team chat the whole work day as this is how our team members post questions and announcements.
Every time a team member posts a message to the open chat my screen reader seems to focus on the message, i.e. away from what I’m currently doing.  It drives me crazy and is very unproductive as you can imagine. 

The quickest way I have found to restore focus to my current application is by pressing the alt key twice, but surely there’s a solution?
I have checked Skype settings, specifically checking that Always on Top wasn’t checked and it doesn’t make a difference.
 
I googled and found Doug Lee’s scripts for SFB and downloaded the version for SFB prior to SFB2016, hoping that might solve it.
Unfortunately I suspect they’re not compatible with Jaws 2020, because in the installer the list is blank under the text that reads:
“The following compatible versions of JAWS have been found on your system.  All versions

are currently selected for installation.  Use Space to alter selections if necessary, then press

Install to proceed.”
I then activate Install anyway but the installer just closes.
 
The system configuration we’re using at work is determined at a corporate level, so I have no control over that.  I’m using:
Windows 8.1 pro
Skype for Business version 2015
JAWS Version 2020.1912.11.400
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

Jaws not loading my settings and correct voice 7 messages,"Hi,
I started my computer yesterday and when the screen came up to enter my pin, Jaws spoke and it was using the Tom compact voice which is the correct voice. After I put my pin in and my computer continued to load and Jaws came up speaking it was using the Jaws eloquence voice. I then restarted my computer twice again and the same thing happened. I have never in all my years of using Jaws had the change of voice happen. I have Tom compact voice as my default voice. I have use this voice for years and it has come up running every time. So since the Jaws voice was not correct I assume my settings were not being loaded either.  So I went into the Jaws settings and merge my settings over from Jaws 18 and as soon as I did this the Tom compact voice came on and my Jaws is working like it should be. One more thing when I shut down my pc that night and turned it off that night it was running correctly and then I turn it on in the morning and the settings did not come on  correctly with the correct voice. So have any of you ever had this happen where your voice and settings never came up running correctly?
Mr. EdThis happens for me fairly often. The fast solution is to go into voice profiles with JAWS key+control+s to select my default. I agree, though, it is disconcerting.Hi,
Do you think it is only changing the voice profile or do you think it is also not loading the personal Jaws settings?
If you change the voice profile back then how do you tell the personal Jaws settings are loaded?
Mr. EdHi Adrian & Mr. Ed,
 
Have either of you noticed if this happens after an update?  Or is it a spiratic random pain in the posterior?!  It seems like Win10 1903 came out with 2 or 3 cumulative updates in a short period of time and you know we all receive updates at different times depending on what criteria I don't have a clue!  Since I run eloquence as my default I've never had this happen.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!It is changing only the voice profile.It doesn’t happen often, and I’m hard-pressed to detect a pattern. It happened when I rebooted the other day, but not right after a Win10 update. The one reliable occurrence is brief but odd. When I unload JAWS with JAWS key+F4, another voice temporarily takes over. I think it’s Eloquence. But when I bring back JAWS, my default voice reasserts itself.
 
The only time this phenomenon was a real nuisance was when I updated JAWS. I’d lose my default completely and have to use the synthesizer manager to get it back. However, I haven’t experienced the problem after the last one or two updates.
 Hi Mike,
No update were being done. My computer was working great when I shut it down for the night and then the next day when I turned it on the voice and settings were not loaded. I rebooted a number of time with the same results. I had to merge my settings over from Jaws 18 again and now is seem to be working okay. Never had this issue in using Jaws for Numerous years.

Jaws versus other solutions,"Hello everyone, I hope you are keeping really well. Loosely, Freedom
scientific is by far the largest manufacturer of assistive technology
solutions for those who are blind or visually impaired. Moreover, it
is the primal developer and unique provider of the broadly recognised
screen reading solution, Jaws for Windows. I don’t think I need to
explain what Jaws is. It is known worldwide. Nonetheless, in the
recent years, Jaws has been coerced to enter a tallying rivalry.
Subsequent to the development and mass embracement of the concept of
free screen readers, the trait of merchandising Jaws globally has been
substantially lowered. Many people became more interested in free
screen readers solution. I certainly do not destine to promote
something in particular on that regard. Nonetheless, I’d aim to argue
for the affirmitive, as to the necessity to dispose of this immense
illusion, that Jaws is invincible. People have been manipulated to
incorrectly assume, that major computer tasks are undone properly
unless you use Jaws. This is a biased standpoint. I have shifted to
free screen readers and I am quite satisfied with their brilliant
outcome. I simply am carrying on all primal computer chores. At work
and home, I  conveniently interact with various applications. The
question I have for Freedom Scientific affiliates, why would I spend
thousands of dollars on a license of a software that is now utterly
contested and possibly rather surmounted? Freedom Scientific regularly
releases consecutive versions, to somewhat compel the user to upgrade
frequently, so they could keep their profit margin on the rise. The
right to freely access information is unexclusive and it has to be
supremely prioritised. Moreover, purchasing Jaws is absolutely
unaffordable for many people, especially, those who permanently reside
in developing nations. The concept of open source screen readers is
intemperately advocated for from ethical perspective. Freedom
Scientific takes advantage of the Jaws stereotype, so they could sell
further licenses and extend their technological ascendancy per say, as
farther as they possibly could. Their marketing team convinces
colleges, that in order for their visually impaired students to
perform well, they must buy Jaws for them. Thence, Freedom Scientific
essentially relies on orders given by enormous organisations, as of
colleges, popular associations for the blind et cetera. However, if
they would have relied on the actual user, they may have ended up
losing a fortune. Also, the concept of open source screen readers is a
decent alternative to get rid of the moral crisis of tolerating
software piracy. I unfortunately used to be one of those who copied
and used Jaws illicitly. I reposed my conscience for quite awhile.
Now, I determined to stop doing that. I was one of those who were
quite cozened about Jaws and its unvanquishable stance. I urge Freedom
Scientific staff to sternly redress their current situation. Despite
its popularity, Jaws is factually now clobbered with unrestricted
alternatives. People at Freedom Scientific must recognise this reality
and deal with it. Many people including myself, do not have the motive
to buy Jaws, as long as its free counterpart is constantly available.
It makes everything beautifully accessible, just like Jaws and
possibly even better. So, the logical question here is, why would I
buy Jaws, even in the theoretical instance of affording it, if I could
equally cope with demands executing plenty of free alternatives? This
question is gravely valid. I keenly await responses from Freedom
Scientific staff to argue their case and attempt to sustain their
proposition, that Jaws is practically unparalleled. I must mention
here, that I have been using Jaws for nearly fifteen years. I didn’t
catch any major difference when I switched to the unrestricted
substitute. Lastly, I truly thank each and everyone who has read my
message with sincere interest. I ultimately must assure all
recipients, that I didn’t covet to provoke or offend anyone with what
I said. It’s of individual preference to use whatever you’re
comfortable with. I just destined to state my opinion plainly. Thank

"Jaws, MS Teams and BT headsets","Where I work we are moving to use MS Teams in place of actual phones for calling.
 
Does anyone have recommendations for wireless headsets that work with both?  I currently use Apple Beats X, but in order to get this to work properly I have to use the microphone from my laptop and not the headset.  This is the only way I have been able to configure it to work.  If I try to use the microphone from the headset, then while on a call I no longer have any feedback from Jaws.  If I leave the mike set to the laptop, well Jaws then continues to work while on the call.
 
I have tried a Logitech wireless headset that uses the Logitech dongle, and that seems to work without issues, but they are only comfortable for a little bit, which won’t work.
 
Looking for any recommendations from those who may have already gone down this path and found something that works.  Just as a side note, wired headsets work fine, but I don’t want that.

"Jaws, pdf and ocr 3 messages","Afternoon all.
 
Using jaws 2018, windows 10 and a Dell laptop, I was trying to open a pdf document with Adobe Dc software. It would no be read with jaws, so I used the OCR software. I used the steps provided by a previous post (insert spacebar, O for Ocr, and D). I got a message that ocr failed to start. Has anyone ever come across this problem, and what was the solution? Thanks in advance.
 
JerryI posted this quite a while ago.  Since then, the problem has been resolved, but since you’re using an earlier version of JAWS, you might look at the previous fix.  I can’t remember if it was Adobe or Vispero that solved the issue.
Open Adobe, either from the icon on your desktop, or from the start menu.
Press control-k.
Press s till you hear

There is a checkbox that says,
Enable protected mode at startup.  If it’s checked.  Press the spacebar to uncheck it.
If you get a warning message, that’s okay.  You need to change this to make it work.

Eventually I got a prompt indicating that I was at a certain numbered location and that another location was number 673 and it had a higher number. I was asked if I wanted to go to that higher nmber and when I said yes, the PC jumped to the same spot as was on my iPhone.
But it took a while and I think i  also had my iPhone open as well which made the sync possible.

Labels bug fixed,"Hi guys,
    I think I recently posted a message since I found out a bug in
      Skype 8.56 or so, where after logging out of you account the ""Sign
      in with another account"" button was not labeled correctly, meaning
      that JAWS only said button. Now I figured out that it's fixed with
      Skype 8.57, so if you did not update and you often need to pass
      from an account to another I recommend you to update asap.
    In case it is useful, I am now using Skype 8.57, JAWS 2020 latest
      build, and scripts revision 137. OS is Windows 10 version  1909.

Links Inquiry 10 messages,"Afternoon all.
 
Using Jaws 2018 and Windows 10 on a Dell laptop, I need some information on an issue with website links.
 
I am trying to do some online research, and one of the links I am attempting to open says “link World War 2 on mouse over”. I have tried opening it with the spacebar, pressing enter, and the applications (shift f10) keys. None work. Can anyone answer this issue and offer a workaround? Thanks.
 
JerryWhich browser are you using when this happens?
Have you tried insert + F7 to list the links?
HTH.
GlennI did listing the links, and it did no good. My web browser is IE 11. Thanks for the reply.Root jaws to pc, and double click.
You can also try it without the virtual cursor on.Exactly what do you mean, keyboard-wise, by double clicking? I do not use a mouse.Us the jaws cursor.
Insert minus on the numpad
Then, double click the left mouse button.
 For a mouseover link, press control-numpad enter and the PC cursor key, all at the same time. Listen carefully for what JAWS says after you release the keys.Which browser are you using? There is a website I use all the time and I have this same issue but I switched back to IE and problem resolved.
 
LarryLarry:
 
I use IE 11, and the suggestion provided from Adrian worked great. It is
 
when on the specific link, press control jawskey enter (the last two keys are on the numpad). Then listen to what jaws says. Hope this help, as it helped me.
 Also, internet explorer might be your issue.

Hi All,
 
I ran across a tip on how to set the time for how long balloon messages will stay up so you can have time to access them.  Here you go;
 
In Windows 7 it's under ""Ease of Access"".  Type Ease of Access in to the
search box in the start prompt. In the Ease of Access Center go to, ""Make  it
easier to focus on tasks"", and hit enter.
Near the end of the options that come up is a combobox with different time settings to adjust the time
that those balloons stay on screen.
I adjusted mine to 1 minute which gives me enough time to find them and
click on them.  Hope this helps.  Take care.
Mike
 
Working with Balloon messages using Windows 7
 
If you are using windows 7 and you would like to delay the time for the windows balloon system notification to disappear, please do the following.
 
The first thing we will need to do is access the ease of access center, which you could quickly navigate there by pressing Windows key plus the letter U.
After arriving to the ease of access center, you will need to tab until you hear ""Use the computer without a display"" without the quotes and press enter.
In the next dialog, press your tab key until you land on a combo box, which will ask, ""How long should window notification dialog boxes stay up?"" Use your
up and down arrow keys until you land on your preferred time. After you make your selection, tab to the ok button and activate it with the space bar and
you are done.

Might be a bug in JAWS with the new edge browser? 2 messages,"Hello to all.
I'm tried simply just smacking the enter key, I've tried alt down arrow and I tried to simply right arrowing, and I can not get the combo box to open to easily down arrow to the lesson that I need, then press the go button that's under that and simply go to that lesson.
But I can go to the page in the lesson that I need that is lesson four, if I simply go to the bottom of the page and go up to next and smack enter and luckily the page number is just above the next button towards the bottom of the screen.
The web page that I have in my favorites is as follows:
www.training.fema.gov
Then in the search engine, go to the search engine and you'll want 200 c
Then you'll want independent study.
Once that pops up for some strange reason you'll have to search for 200 c once again, You should see the link for 200 c.
Click on the link and down arrow until you see something like take the internet self study course.
Many Thanks.

Moving Email In WLM 21 messages,"Win 10
Latest Jaws
WLM 12
 
To move an email to a folder in WLM, I use ctrl shift V. Neither Jaws nor Window Eyes will read the list of folders.
 
Any ideas?
 
Bob Ringwald
Amateur (ham) radio station K6YBV
www.ringwald.comAre your windows maximized?
Or at least the eMail window?Select the messages you want to move, press the context key and choose Move or press the letter v,. The folders will be displayed so just arrow to the one where you want the messages.I used to know how to maximize a window in WE. But forgot.
 
How do I     DO IT IN jaws?How do I select the email that I want to move?
 
If I am sitting on the email and hit  the context key, there is no move function.
 
If I hit V, also does nothing.
 
-BobWhen you are on a message, it's selected already.
You can hold the shift key and arrow through consecutive messages and move them.
You can search for a bunch and select some or all of them and move them.
On maximizing, do alt + Space, and X.
I think windows + up arrow maximizes too.
GlennPress the space bar to make sure the message is selected and I always get the move option on the context menu. If you are not seeing it, you may need to do a repair on WLM
To maximize any window, if using Jaws, you can do an alt+space bar and arrow down to maximize or type the letter X. Another method is to press ctrl +the up Arrow.You need to maximize both the program window and the message window. Once I have done this, I do not have to do it again.I do everything and still do not see list of folders. A sighted person sees them but neither Jaws nor WE verbalizes them. Even did a WLM repair.
 
-BobDid the video settings get changed?
Sometimes people with low vision will change the display settings, and then Jaws has trouble reading some elements.
Glennare you useing something other then the standard windows color scheme and resolusion?
have you checked to see if jaws has the correct script file associated with wlm?
i don't have your problem with  folders not being spoken with wlm 2012, window eyes, jaws 2019 or nvda. they all work.How do I get the Jaws script file for WLM 12?

BobI dought that the video settings got changed. But will try to check.
 
Would that affect Window Eyes also?
 
BobPerhaps not, as I don't know if WE uses a video intercept for TTS.
Glennit should already be in the applications list. its called windows live mail.
while wlm is loaded press the jaws and 6 keys to open the script manager.
try pressing the jaws and t key to hear the title of the script file wlm is useing.
if it is not windows live mail tab to the application list to see if the windows live mail script is in the list.
i'm not sure on this. but once it is highlighted  i think you only have to close the script manager and it would then be associated with the wlm program.Hi Net bat,
 
Insert + 6, opens the settings center.  Are you meaning the, Insert + Q, keystroke by chance?

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.no, i don't know what about 90 percent of the shortcut keys do. grin
i used insert 6 to find out which script is being used and if it is not the right one for the program running i change it there.What is the jaws key?the insert key. i guess fs dropped the name jaws key to describe this jaws modifier key.
it also depends on which keyboard layout you use.
jaws uses the insert key on the 6 pack for the desktop keyboard. the laptop layout uses the caps lock key.
if you press insert 1 this will  turn on  and off the keyboard help and you can try all the key combonations to see what they do.
if you double press the keys that have a description it will give you more info.It is the -00 key on the number pad.

Pastor GilI don't see a 00 key on the number pad. I used insert 1 to get the function of every key and none said 00.

NVDA Skype add-on update released (was Re: Skype is unified! Skype UWP for Windows 10 is now the same as Skype for Windows Desktop! Here's what will happen and what to do.),"I have released version 2018.04.2 of the Skype add-on for NVDA, at https://www.dlee.org/skype/NVDA/skype.nvda-addon

Apologies for the funny version number btw; I just noticed it says 2018 as I was writing this announcement, and I already announced the update in other places.

Features:

URL change! The old skype/electron URL will still work for a while, but the above URL is the new location for this add-on.

Works with both Skype for Windows Desktop (Skype 8) and Skype UWP for Windows 10, which is now the same interface.

Fixes review cursor navigation in messages in a chat history list. I did this long ago, but it broke at some point.

A note that I also included when I announced the JAWS script update:

If you are migrating from Skype for Windows Desktop to the newly identical Skype for Windows 10, check your settings (Ctrl+Comma), because settings from one version may not be automatically applied to the other even though
the interfaces are the same. I recommend paying particular attention to where Skype says your audio will come from and go to.

Hello Mike,

First of all, if you turn off the display of grammatical errors in Word you
will not be able to use Word's feature of displaying incorrect grammar in a
document.  The JAWS detection of the marked errors only points out the
places in the document marked with the blue underline by Word.  Turning off
the JAWS detection does not turn off Word's displaying of grammatical
errors.  However, it is the JAWS detection that doesn't stop when unchecked
in the Settings Center.  Turning off the Word options affects the proofing
and the display of errors whereas the JAWS feature is just for whether or
not those errors should be detected by JAWS and spoken.  

To access the proofing options in Word do the following:

1.  Hold down Alt key, press F while the alt key is held down and then
release the Alt key.  If you are used to the menu structure that is the same
keystroke used for going into a file menu.  The Alt+F keystroke activates
the File button in later versions of Word.
2.  After using the Alt with F keystroke use the letter T by itself.  This
activates the Word Options menu item.
3.  After pressing the letter T focus should go into a list of categories
for the Word options.  At that point either press the letter P to select the
Proofing options or use down arrow key until you get to the Proofing
category.  
4.  Once you have selected the Proofing category by either pressing P or
using down arrow to it, you use the tab key to move from option to option
relevant to proofing.
   Use the tab key (in Word 2013 you tab 12 times but it might vary in other
Word versions) until you find a checkbox labeled ""Mark grammar errors as you
type.""  If JAWS says it is checked then use spacebar to uncheck it.  If in
the future you want grammar errors marked by Word as you type in a document
then go back into the options and check the box.  
5.  After using the spacebar to uncheck the box use tab key a couple times
to find a checkbox labeled ""Check Grammar with Spelling.""  If JAWS says it
is checked then use spacebar to remove the checkmark.  If in the future you
want grammar to be checked with spelling then go back into the Proofing
options and check this box.
6.  After using spacebar to remove the checkmark use tab key until you find
the OK button and use spacebar to activate the button.

The above steps are for stopping Word from marking grammatical errors with a
blue underline.  If you want Word to display grammatical errors but not have
JAWS detect and speak them that is where the current problem with JAWS lies
as using the checkbox in the JAWS Settings Manager to stop the detection
doesn't seem to work, at least for Word 2013.      

Take care.

New Dropbox Navigation 3 messages,"Howdy All,
 
I just ran into an issue with Dropbox where it wouldn't let me acces my files.  Well, it turned out that it wanted to update and after downloading the installer and reinstalling Dropbox navigating the folders flat out sucked, so here's how to change the necessary setting for easier navigation.
 
1. Open Dropbox from the system tray, tab to, Access and Manage your Dropbox settings button, and press enter.
 
2. Now tab to, Preferences, and press enter.
 
3. On the General tab, tab to the, Open folders in Dropbox combobox, open this combobox and choose the, Explorer, option.  With Jaws you can open this combobox with Alt + down arrow and then up arrow to the Explorer option and press enter to close the combobox.  Now tab to, Okay, and press enter to save and close preferences.
Note:  This can act a little tricky so it might take a couple of attempts to get the Explorer settings change to stick.
If you have a shortcut key that opens Dropbox options, after you openDropbox up arrow to, Preferences, press enter and follow step 3 from above.
 
 

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!Mike,
That definitely works.
When I encountered this issue earlier today, I did the following which also works.

I resolved the problem by going to my C drive,  opening Users, then opening my user folder and then opening the dropbox folder which lives there. I then created a desktop shortcut.

I'm going to have to try this new info myself here soon.

New Jaws update what's new 3 messages,"Hi all,
Here is what's new:
Enhancements in JAWS 2019.1907.31 (August 2019)

The following is a list of improvements made in JAWS 2019 between the June 2019 update and the August 2019 update.

To download the latest release, visit the Downloads web page. You must be logged on as an administrator to install this software.

This update fixes an issue encountered by some users where JAWS was not reading as expected in the Windows 10 Start menu. If you are experiencing this problem, open JAWS Settings Center, press CTRL+SHIFT+D to load the Default File, type ""start"" into the search edit box, and then toggle the control called: ""Start menu: Access-Out-of-Process"" so that it is checked.
In response to customer feedback, JAWS sounds such as when INSERT+SPACEBAR is pressed to enter Layered Keys mode are no longer muted when Speech On Demand is active.
Addressed an issue where the Text Analyzer keystrokes were not being found when using the JAWS Commands Search feature (INSERT+SPACEBAR, J).
When creating meeting requests using the Outlook calendar, resolved an issue where new attendee information was not being reliably indicated in either speech or braille.
Resolved a reported issue where the keystrokes to read message headers in Outlook, ALT+1 through 4 on the number row, were not working in Windows 7.
Resolved an issue where returning to an open Outlook email after exiting a Word Document would result in your cursor landing at the top of the email rather than the previous location where you were reading.
Resolved an issue in Microsoft Office where JAWS was not reporting if an endnote or footnote had been inserted with speech even though Braille was correctly identifying the information.
Addressed an issue in Word 2016 reported by SSA where JAWS would repeat the last line of the document after completing a Say All (INSERT+DOWN ARROW).
Addressed a reported issue where the spelling buzzer to indicate a misspelled word was still being heard even when the ""Detect spelling while typing"" option in setting Center was disabled.
In Microsoft Teams, resolved an issue where JAWS was speaking incoming message and call notifications multiple times.
When navigating by character in secure password fields in Chrome and Firefox, resolved an issue where JAWS was saying ""star"" multiple times for each character.
Addressed a reported issue in Chrome where typing in contracted Braille was not working as expected.
Resolved a customer reported issue with SQL Server Management Studio where JAWS was not properly navigating and reading a results Data grid.
Resolved an issue reported by international Braille users where incorrect Unicode characters were being entered using computer braille under cHow many of us actually experienced any of these issues I wonder?
 I remember some of these issues as problems people have posted to this list. I’m glad Vispero takes the trouble to note the ones they’ve fixed, even if there are others that seem to be neglected. Also, the fixes list is never comprehensive. A few updates ago, they fixed an annoying problem I and others were having with Word, but I didn’t read about it in the “What’s New” section. Even beyond these issues, cumulatively, JAWS gets better at handling Chrome, the Internet in general, and other aspects of our computer-based work. I think it’s a very good thing that Vispero keeps us informed and that we have Mike B to make it even easier for those of us on this list to get that information.",,,,,1,580,74.36,26.93,80,37.6,24.17,24.66,79.48,58.79,46.55,6.9,2.93,1.03,0.86,0.69,0,0.34,3.97,13.62,8.79,1.9,11.9,7.59,6.55,5.86,1.72,16.21,4.31,1.9,3.1,1.03,1.03,1.03,11.72,0.69,11.03,3.28,1.55,0.69,1.55,0.52,3.62,0.17,2.24,1.72,0.52,0.52,0.34,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,7.76,5.52,0.17,0.34,0.17,0,4.14,2.41,0,0,0,0,1.55,0,0,1.55,4.83,0,0.34,4.48,0.34,0,2.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,0,0.69,0,0,0,0,0.34,0.34,3.1,11.38,1.21,0.86,9.14,0,0.52,0,5.52,6.9,2.76,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,14.14,4.31,3.62,0.17,0,1.03,5

Notifications and Action Center 10 messages,"Ok, I'm confused and frustrated. From time to time, I hear JAWS announce a notification, such as when its booting up or when a device is inserted, etc. But I cannot ever find this text anywhere on the screen. Where is JAWS reading this from and how can I review or act upon it?

I was thinking I heard that these notifications could be heard by pressing windows-a, but this brings up something called the Action Center, and I cannot figure out what I can do with this dialog. Tabbing around seems to leave me with the option of clearing these actions, but again, how do I actually learn what these actions want me to do and how I can act upon them?

If there's any documentation on this, please point me in that direction.

Thanks,
JeffWindows-a, that will bring up the notification center.Thanks, Mike, but did you read my message? I know that windows-a brings up the Actions Center, but as I said in my original message, what can I do in this Action Center besides clear the notifications? How can I read what action is needed and take that action?

Thanks,
JeffHi Jeff,
in the following guide to the Taskbar in Windows 10, there's a section on notifications:
http://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Taskbar-10-Guide.html

David.David, you do have some great material on your web page. I just hope you keep it coming along, thank you.Thanks, David. I appreciate your guide. I found it helpful, although I'm not sure how to take action on a notification. This is probably because I don't have any that need action to be taken at this time. Hopefully, I'll remember what to do when I do get such a notification.

JeffHi Jeff,
Maybe this will help, I saved one of Mike's messages, which I think he had saved from someone else.

Here you go:
 
Hi All,
 
I ran across a tip on how to set the time for how long balloon messages will stay up so you can have time to access them.  Here you go;
 
In Windows 7 it's under ""Ease of Access"".  Type Ease of Access in to the
search box in the start prompt. In the Ease of Access Center go to, ""Make  it
easier to focus on tasks"", and hit enter.
Near the end of the options that come up is a combobox with different time settings to adjust the time
that those balloons stay on screen.
I adjusted mine to 1 minute which gives me enough time to find them and
click on them.  Hope this helps.  Take care.
MikeHi Jeff & Glenn,
 
Those steps are for Windows 7.  Below are steps for Windows 10 to keep the notification on the screen longer, but the keystroke to access a notification if it pops-up is, Windows key, Shift + V.
From: Bill White 
1. Open Control Panel.
2. Navigate to Ease of Access, and press ENTER.
3. Navigate to the ""Make it easier to focus on Tasks link and press ENTER.
4. TAB about ten times to the ""How long should Windows Notification Dialog Boxes Stay Open"" dialog. 
5. Arrow up and down in the combo box to find your desired length.
6. TAB to the OK button, and press ENTER.
7. Now Windows Notifications will stay open longer.


Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Hi Jeff,
thanks for the feedback. Concerning taking action on a notification, then for both banner notifications and notifications in the Action center:
1. Immediately after moving to a notification, pressing spacebar or enter normally takes you to the app or part of Windows which sent the notification.
2. A notification may contain additions controls for actions related to the notification, and you tab to these if they are present.

I've updated my guide to try and make this clearer,
David.Hi Mike,
just to add that you can also change the time the notification remains opens in the Settings app, and it's simpler:
1. Press Windows key + U. The settings app opens at the Ease of Access page, with the first category, Display, selected.
2. Tab to the Show notifications for combo box, and select the time that you want.

Office 13 Inquiry 2 messages,"Good afternoon all.
 
Using jaws 2018 and Windows 10 on a Dell laptop, can anyone tell me if it is possible to install office 13 on more than one device, and if so, what are the steps for doing so? The second device is also a laptop with Windows 10 on it. Thanks in advance for any assistance.
 
JerryHello,
 
It depends on whether you have a multi-user license for office 13.  If yes, then you simply run the installer on the new laptop.
 
If you have only a single-user license, then no it isnnot possible.

One Drive,"Hi Folks,

At the moment, I have two desktops, two documents, and two downloads folder, but while one set is in it’s normal place, my user folder, the other set is in a user folder/one drive.
 
I want to uninstall this feature, but I don’t seem to know where to do that.
 
Aside from that, I don’t even see a place where I can configure it, so it doesn’t display these extra folders, as it makes it very hard to save files.

Online Backup Services 14 messages,"Hi all,
 
Can anyone recommend an online pc backup service that work well with Jaws. Downloaded and bought Idrive last night and find that I can’t figure out how to get Jaws to work with it. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,
ChrisI use Open Drive.
It's 100 bucks a year for unlimited.
It has a secure folder that you will want to back up your critical stuff.
You will want to download their wizard and when you do that, you just sync folders on your computer and it keeps them backed up.
GlennI’m too cheap to pay for a backup service, I just purchased an external drive and back up all my files to that.Cool, thanks. Thinking about getting my money back from Idrive. 😊
 Is this the same as one drive?I'm with Larry. Online backup services are not inexpensive and require a speedy Internet service and still are not as fast as an external USB drive. I realize an external USB drive doesn't meet the offsite backup recommendation but it is a lot less expensive and much faster.

Alan Lemly This is a Jaws thing too:
“My Computer Works,” out of Arizona Provides not only back up of everything on your Machine, they offer Assisting services and teaching classes, something new this year. There is that price, yet, in my 6 years with them I find them a valued service. The last time I heard they are along with working with businesses, me and 8 other blind persons and other sighted clients.. Just so you know if this is something you want in setting up with them in a contract, yearly, you will have three icons from them on your desk. All speak English..

 No, it is something different.
GlennAlso, it is not just for backing up.
You can use the public folder to place files and send links to people to download.
GlennWell, drives fail.
I would not consider it one or the other.
Drives are a good source of storage, but there's nothing wrong with keeping the irreplaceable stuff on-line too, that is, along with backing up on a drive.
But if I could only do one or the other, on-line would be the way I'd go.
If we have an EMP or CME, it could wipe out all magnetic data, and I'm guessing on-line drives are magnetic.
The irreplaceable stuff would best stored on a disk of sorts, ie, CD DVD, bluray.
 
GlennHi,
About how much does this service cost?
Mr. Ed
 I use backblaze for my mac.  haven’t installed it on the pc yet, but if the mac is any clue, it works flawlessly.

$95 per year, with unlimited storage.
First backup takes a while, but after that only changes.
Restores are easy, you select what you want from a web page, and it emails you a link to a zip file.

Outlook list boxes not read by Jaws. 3 messages,"Hi, All,
 
In all my years on the PC and since Jaws 3.0, I have never seen this behavior.
 
My inbox list of messages is invisible to Jaws, although Jaws works when opening a message.  But Jaws will not read the message list as I arrow up and down.  NVDA has no problem with this, and I am having no problems composing a new message with Jaws.
 
This is not only true of the inbox, but the other boxes in my Outlook program.  I am using Windows 10, Jaws 19 and Outlook 10.
 
This just started a few minutes ago, and I haven’t been doing anything out of the ordinary with my PC.
 
Any ideas?  Thanks.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”First,
Reboot your computer.
If that doesn’t clear it up, then make sure the preview pane didn’t get turned on.
If that doesn’t help, I’d suggest a call to Microsoft Accessibility since you didn’t do anything out of the ordinary.  An update may have happened or an accidental key press that changed something.

PDF Open parent document 14 messages,"Hi all,
 
When clicking on a link within a web page to go to a pdf document I am given the option to select a button “open parent document”,  this is my only option and after selecting I still cannot read the pdf document.
Any help would be appreciated.
Running Windows 10, latest Jaws I e and chrome.
 
Thanks
 
JohnI got that same message yesterday with IE and with Chrome. But with Chrome I was able to continue to arrow down and read the PDF. It would be good to know what this message is and how to resolve it.
 
LarryTry pressing Alt, then F and arrow down to save as. Once the doc is saved, Adobe will open it and it is readable.
 
CherThis message is caused in IE 11 by the Adobe Add-in being enabled causing IE to try to open the document in the web page.  You can stop this and get the document opened in Adobe reader by going to Internet Options, Programs Tab, and then list all add-in programs.  Disable the Adobe add-in and the document will open correctly.  This used to be taken care of by the Accessibility Wizard in Adobe reader, but for whatever reason they discontinued asking this question and you now must take care of it yourself.
Hth ---Do you mean manage add-ons, because I can’t find add-ins. Also, under my add-ons there is no add-on for Adobe.
 
LarryLarry,
Yes, I mean add-ons.  You need to select the list all add-ons to see the Adobe add-on.  As I recall it is necessary to actually use the space bar on this selection to bring up the full list.  The list of add-ons should be around 25 or so if they are all listed.
Hth ---I looked again and there are only 3 add-ons listed in my currently loaded add-ons, under the run without permissions there are 43 add-ons which are mostly Microsoft add-ons; nothing for Adobe. When I was still using windows 7 there were more add-ons in the current list than with win10.
 
LarryYou should check to make sure the combo box after add-ons is not set to add-ons currently running.  It should be set on all add-ons.
 
VictorCorrect.  My list shows a total of 23 add-ons.  This is the one in question.
Name                Adobe PDF Reader
Publisher           Adobe Systems, Incorporated
Status              Disabled
Architecture        32-bit and 64-bit
Once again, note that when you set the combo box to all add-ons you still have to hit enter to  activate the selections.
--hth ---My mistake, it’s hit the space bar to make the selection for all add-ons.
Sorry about that!Thanks Victor;
I thought there should have been a tab showing all add-ons but for some reason it was hidden and it took a bit of work to get it unhidden. I’m not sure what all of the Microsoft add-ons are used for but for now I’ll just leave them turned on.
 
LarryI’m getting in late on this thread, but I recall that I couldn’t find the Adobe add-on with the PC cursor. I found it with the touch cursor. I could then disable it. I can’t remember if I went b ack to the PC cursor to disable it or not. I say this because displaying all add-ons can be tricky.Hi
 
Thanks for all help, I have disabled adobe add on which has now resolved the issue of “open parent document” button. I did however require sighted assistance to accomplish this.
Thanks
 
JohnOn a related question, if the PDF Reader extension needs to be disabled in IE in order for Acrobat Reader PC to read PDF documents correctly, is the same true for Google Chrome???

Pathways to Literary- Laptop Command Guide 5 messages,"Hi everyone,

Thank you for all your very helpful responses about whether to purchase an external keyboard with a num pad for my laptop.  I have decided to go ahead and teach myself JAWS with the laptop commands instead of the desk top commands.  We will see how it goes- big smile!

I found this online guide to learning JAWS with laptop commands put out by an organization called Pathways to Literary.  Is anyone familiar with this organization? At first perusal, the guide looks very helpful for beginners like me and here is the link:

http://www.pathstoliteracy.org/strategies/learning-jaws-lessons-and-review  

I am listening to the beginner audio tutorials from JAWS which are helpful, but seem dated with their references to DVD installations and JAWS version 9 and so forth. Not sure why a more current version is unavailable, but perhaps it is not necessary as the basic commands do not vary much over time.

Thanks again for all your assistance. It is much appreciated.

Regards, MichelleThanks Michelle, that does look like a good resource.  I noticed a reference to Perkins School and did not find a price; is this actually free?
This may be a great resource, paid or free, for agencies who maybe cannot get people in for training who have the basic skills to access the internet already.
 
Thanks for sharing.
Richard

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss."" --Douglas Adams, from Life, The Universe and Everything, p.591 last quick note on this laptop keyboard thing though. Even if you do set it to laptop and use the laptop strokes when and if ever you do use either a external wired or wireless keyboard you could use the desktop key strokes as well. only thing will be is the tapping the caps lock 2 times to either turn it on or off since it is now a JAWS key too.Hi Michelle and List,
 
While I have no experience with the Pathways to Literary site you linked, I can confirm that I was able to download the lessons in one 89-page PDF file from that site with no charge. I'll leave it to you to decide whether the lessons help you learn JAWS.
 
I would strongly recommend you create a JAWS shortcut key file to have a reference of the hotkeys you use most frequently with JAWS. I have found that Microsoft Excel works best for maintaining tabular data since it can easily be sorted and can be configured to read column headings and row titles with JAWS. I am constantly opening my Excel file to refresh my memory of hotkeys I use most frequently. I would also urge you to monitor this list daily. I've gotten the majority of my JAWS training from reading posts here and making notes of the hotkeys learned here.
 
Good luck with your learning.

Pearl camera issue 15 messages,"Hi folks:
 
Using a HP elite book, windows 10 and jaws 2019.
 
While attempting to use the pearl camera I’m getting the following.
I press insert Space, followed by O, followed by a. The pearl camera is showing, yet when I press acquire I get the message, OCR started. Nothing else happens. I’m not getting the shutter sound and no recognition is happening.
 
Any thoughts?
 
Thanks.
 
Chris.To take a picture you just press
The spacebar.
Besure the camera lite is on
Then you get the little tones and then the shutter sound.Hello Chris,
 
One thing to check is that the light is on.  In the dialog box that has the Acquire button is a combo box to choose if the light is on, off or the automatic option.  In OpenBook the light needs to be on (toggled on and off in OpenBook with CTRL+L), but in this JAWS dialog box the options are in the combo box. 
 
Take care.
 
Brian Lee
brianllee@...Hi, the light is on. Thanks for the suggestionYes, I know how to do it, I’ve used it on many computers, the light is on, it’s just not working, it says acquiring image but nothing else happensThis would only be an issue if you have an older     PC, but i had a Pearl camera when I was working, and we had a similar issue at first. In this instance, the problem was that the Pearl was connected to a USB-1 port.  It must be connected to at least a USB-2 port because it derives power from that port.
 
AndyDid you turn on the Pearl camera light?  I don't have time to look up the command, something like control-shift-l.
 
 Interesting. I tried it on 2 of our working computers at work. They are both brand new. I have an older HP that I use for training, and the pearl camera works fine on that one.Yes I did. It’s on by default. I tried all three settings.
 If your computer has different ports, try some other ones.
Sometimes only some ports have extra power sent to them.
GlennYes!  For example, typically USB ports located on the front face of the machine do not send power to devices.
 
AndyIf you’re running what does 19.03 there is a camera driver update Freedom Scientific email me off-line I’ll send it to you need to install damper work fineThese HP elites only have 2 USB ports. I will try the other port, can’t remember if I did that or knot. I thought I had, at least on of the computers, but I may not have done. Thanks for the suggestions.These computers are running 1809. Our service desk hasn’t given the go ahead to upgrade to 1903 yet.You will need the update for 1803 also",,,,,1,466,64.1,10.52,35.64,60.7,13.71,15.88,84.76,66.95,55.36,12.23,7.51,4.72,0.64,1.72,0,0.43,4.72,15.45,9.44,3,12.23,10.94,3.22,4.94,2.15,20.39,4.51,2.79,4.29,0.64,2.15,1.5,12.45,1.07,11.37,1.5,1.5,2.36,3.22,0.43,5.15,0.21,2.58,2.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.65,3.22,0.86,1.29,0,0,2.79,3,0.21,0,0,0,2.79,0,0,2.79,3.65,0,0.21,3.43,0,0,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.64,0,1.93,0.43,0.21,0,0,0,0.64,5.79,6.44,0.64,0.86,2.79,2.36,0.43,0,3.43,4.08,6.22,1.07,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,18.45,8.37,5.15,0.43,0.21,2.15,2.15
Pinning to the task bar 9 messages,"Is there a way to check and perhaps rearrange the order of things that are pinned to the task bar?

 tapping the applications key on an icon within the start menu should present you with an option to pin an icon to the taskbar.

Then, leveraging your Windows key +1-0, dependent on the location of the icon within the taskbar, will allow you to quickly launch that icon.

Tapping Windows key plus the letter t, will let you quickly cycle through the icons on your taskbar, to determine what order they are in for using the previously mentioned key stroke.

I would love information about reorganizing icons in the taskbar, to allow me to be more efficient.

Hope you're wellLast I knew, and that was a couple of Win 10 versions ago, only way to rearrange was to unpin then pin in order one wanted them to appear.
 
AlHi Richard,
 
Other than deleting them all and pasting them in the order you want  the only way I've found is using Drag and Drop.  2 different ways of dragging and dropping are below.
 
Use the key strokes, (CTRL+INSERT+NUM PAD SLASH) for Drag and Drop .
This is used to drag items from one location and drop them in another.
Position the JAWS Cursor on the item you wish to move and press
CTRL+INSERT+NUM
PAD SLASH. You can leave the JAWS Cursor active, or you can switch to the PC
Cursor. JAWS will keep speaking as you navigate. Once you have positioned
the JAWS or PC Cursor in the location to which you would like to move the
item, press CTRL+INSERT+NUM PAD SLASH again, and the item will be moved to
the position of the active cursor.
 
 
From: David Bailes 
Hi,
you can drag them to another location using the Jaws cursor:
1. Move to the program's button that you want to move.
2. Press Insert + Numpad Minus to route the Jaws Cursor to the PC cursor, and then press Insert + Numpad Slash to lock the left mouse button, in other
words, start holding it down.
3. Press Numpad Plus to switch back to using the PC cursor, and then press either Left Arrow or Right Arrow the number of times which is the number of
positions which you want to move the program either to the left or right respectively. This moves the PC cursor to the position where you want the program
to end up.
4. Press Insert + Numpad Minus to route the Jaws cursor to the PC cursor, and press Insert + Numpad Slash to unlock the left mouse button, in other words,
stop holding it down.
5. Finally, press Numpad Plus to switch back to the PC cursor.
David.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Thank you Michael and Mike.
That's what I needed to know.
I took Edge and Mail out of the taskbar since I never use Windows Mail and seldom use Edge, so now it has my most used applications which will do until FS fixes Jaws 2019 so it stops blocking my other hotkeys.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”There are several ways to get to contacts.
1.  The fastest, press control-3 (on top of the keyboard)
Or,
2. Press
control-y
Press c until you hear
Contacts.
Press enter.
Arrow through the contacts using the right or left arrow keys.
Note that you cannot do either from inside an open message.
To get back to your inbox, press control-1.Aw, too bad.  Because I used to choose an e-mail contact from the address book if I couldn’t remember or access it any way else.
 
Thanks very much for those tips.
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Okay, I never do it this way, but you can press control-shift-b and it will bring up a search box for contacts.  Type the name and press enter on the result to get all the information
If you use either of the earlier methods, once the contacts list is open, besides pressing the right and left arrows to navigate, you can also use first letter navigation.
Take your pick.  Many ways as usual.Okay, Nothing populates the fields, and I realize I am using my Google contacts, and haven’t gotten them over to my addressbook.  Strangely enough, when creating a new message, the field will autofill if I have written that person before, but my lists in outlook show zero contacts.
 
You can tell I don’t know what I am doing here.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Hello Judy,
 
In addition to using the CTRL key with the various numbers to move between parts of Outlook, you can use CTRL with Shift and B while composing a message to bring up the address book.  In the resulting dialog box you can show the list by names listed alphabetically by choosing the “Name only” radio button.  There is a combo box from which you can pick the applicable contacts list to search.  When you start typing a name in the search box you can tab to the Go button and use it.  Tab again and you will find a list of names starting with the one you typed in the search box.  Use up or down arrow keys to move up or down the list of names.  When the name you want is in focus tab to whichever button applies to the field in which you want the name to be placed.  There are three buttons, a “To”, a “CC” and a “BCC” button.  After using spacebar on the button that applies, tab to and use the OK button.  This dialog box can be used while composing a new message,. Replying to a message or forwarding a message.
 
Take care.

brianllee@...Learn something every day.  Smile.
I did not have the name only checkbox checked.  Now it is, for future possible use.
But names do have to be in the contacts list for this to work.  As I said off-list
Perhaps what you might want—since you have not added names to your contacts is suggested contacts.  This is a list of all the addresses you’ve sent messages to.
But there’s no reason to go here, if your autofill is working.  Outlook will autofill using likely addresses you’ve used before whether they’re in your contacts or not.
If your autofill does not bring up a name you want, that you’ve sent to before, press
Control-k
For check names.  You can arrow down through that list and press enter.Thanks so much for this.  This is what I was looking for, plus I so much appreciate all the other tips.
 
You guys are the best.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”This is awesome information, thank you.

Possible confusion on Skype UWP scripts for JAWS,"Inamuddin today caused me to realize that I never removed from my website the old JAWS scripts for Skype UWP, which were revision 123. I have now removed them. The URL was https://www.dlee.org/skype/uwp/ and it now points to
the main scripts that work with both Skype UWP and Skype for Windows Desktop identically.

If you have Skype script revision 123 and are using Skype UWP, go to https://www.dlee.org/skype/ and grab an update. The current script release for both Skypes is revision 185. This upgrade should fix problems such as JAWS

"PowerPoint 2016, finding the 31 slide layouts 2 messages","In older versions of PowerPoint there were at least 30 options for slide layouts.  Title and one object, title and two objects, title, object, and picture ...  Listed in probably a grid, although I'm not sure.  In PowerPoint 2016 I cannot find this group of layouts.  Oh, wise ones, where the heck is it????

thanks a lot,

AnnI have become rusty with PowerPoint, but just looked in 2016 to see what I could find.  I do recall in Office 2010 that you could pull up that list of all the slide layouts and use F6 to get to it. I'm not seeing how to do that in 2016.  The two relevant buttons I have found are on the home ribbon.  Hit alt h, then tab about 6 times to a button called slides or once more to a button called Layout.  Alt down arrow on either to get a grid of layout options.  It's not 31, but it's probably the most common.  I'll post again if I find the way to find more.

So obviously if your printer is new, you may have to have sighted assistance to see how the envelope should be inserted.  My HP has a dedicated envelope tray.  The envelope goes in flap-side down and on the left.  After that and especially if you’re using a standard envelope, 4 X 10 I think it is, Word should be able to print it properly without doing anything else.  There is an options button if you keep tabbing and a combo box to choose another size.  Some printers have a dedicated button to print the envelope after you’ve pressed the print button.  Others don’t and you may have a continue button in a dialog box that appears on the screen.  Depending on what has focus, you may have to alt-tab to get to it.  I haven’t done it in a while, but I think just pressing alt-c worked.  You may have to play with it to see how yours works.   
 
 
 
 
 
A mind is like a parachute.  It doesn't work if it isn't open.
 I’m going to use the optacon to check my work.
 
I was thinking you were saying to created the addresses in the original word doc, then bring up the mailer tab, and the addresses would automatically be positioned correctly.
 
Before, I’ve tried bringing up the mailer tab first, then typing in the addresses but never got that to work, same with trying to create a sheet of labels.  That’s why I gave up and started downloading what I needed from Avery.

Providing translations for the Skype scripts,"Hi Doug,

this is Marco from Germany. I just got into translating some of the scripts I use like Skype and Teams, and began to translate them into German. I didn't find a reference to an existing German translation, so decided to start my own.

What would be the best way to distribute said translation once done, so that many people can benefit from it? You mention that translators should proide their translations on their own schedule, but don't mention if there is a recommended way to do it. Is there?

If the answer to this is out of scope for this list, feel free to message me privately.

Putting graphics in a document using Jaws 3 messages,"Hi

Are there any tutorials that cover putting graphics like pictures in a document using Jaws? Or any tips and tricks? I'm doing a course that requires me to produce material including pictures for the class students.

Also, are there any teachers on the list who use Jaws and who would be happy to correspond with me privately?

Thanks for any help anyone is able to offer.


TeriHi Teri,
 
Below is a note I saved, but personally I've never done this.
 
From: Brian Lee
In Word, place the cursor where you want to insert the logo. 
Use Alt followed by N followed by P for choosing a picture to insert.
Browse to the PNG file and insert it.
JAWS recognizes the inserted picture as an object. 
Use CTRL with shift and O to select the picture.
JAWS should speak the height and width of the picture at this point.
Press enter key.
When you press enter key the ""Lay out options"" pane should appear.  It might
come up and have keyboard focus right on the ""See more"" button or you might
have to use F6 until focus is in the pane.
Press spacebar on the ""See more"" button.
There will be three page tabs in the resulting dialog box.  Go to the Size
page.
You can tab across to confirm absolute height and width. 
The aspect ratio will likely be locked and be relative to the original
picture size.  As you tab you should find a rotation box and it is likely on
zero degrees.
There are also two boxes for adjusting height and width, which will  only
work if you uncheck the aspect ratio checkbox. If you do uncheck that
checkbox and adjust height and width percentages then JAWS will speak the
new dimensions in the document when you use CTRL with shift and O to select
the picture.
 
I hope this is what you are wanting.
 
Take care.

I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Hello Teri,
 
I am not sure when I sent the message that Mike showed in his Email but I have revised the note a little.  In Word 2013 I have noticed that the layout pane doesn’t always appear when the object is selected.  However, you can just bring up the contextual menu by using the applications key or Shift with function key 10 and arrow down to the Size menu item.  Press enter on the item and the same dialog box appears that would appear if you used the See More button in the layout pane.  After pressing the CTRL with Shift and O to move to the object use enter to select it.  Be careful not to use an arrow key before or after using the enter key as that will remove the selection from the object. 
 
Here are revised steps that work in Word 2013: 
 
1.     In Word, place the cursor where you want to insert the graphic. 
2.     Use Alt followed by N followed by P for choosing a picture to insert.
3.     Browse to the PNG or other type of picture file and insert it.
JAWS recognizes the inserted picture as an object. 
4.     Use CTRL with shift and O to move to the object.
5.      Immediately press enter key to select the object.  
JAWS should speak the height and width of the picture  and indicate that it is selected at this point.  The layout options pane might appear and if it does and focus moves into it tab to the “See more” button and press spacebar.  It might come up and have keyboard focus right on the ""See more"" button or you might
have to use F6 until focus is in the pane.  
Note:  If the layout pane doesn’t appear when the graphic is selected then use the info starting in step 8 below.   
6.      Press spacebar on the ""See more"" button.
There will be three page tabs in the resulting dialog box.  Go to the Size page.
7.      You can tab across to confirm absolute height and width. The aspect ratio will likely be locked and be relative to the original
picture size.  As you tab you should find a rotation box and it is likely on
zero degrees.  There are also two boxes for adjusting height and width, which will  only
work if you uncheck the aspect ratio checkbox. If you do uncheck that
checkbox and adjust height and width percentages then JAWS will speak the new dimensions in the document when you use CTRL with shift and O and then press enter key to select
the object.
8.       If the layout options pane does not appear when the graphic is selected just use the applications key or shift with function key 10.  In the contextual menu use down arrow key until you find the Size menu item and press enter key.  This will bring up the same dialog box that would appear  if you used the “See More” button in the layout pane. 
9.       Go to the size page of the dialog box and do the same actions mentioned in step 7 above.      
 
The original info was sent as a response to someone wanting to know about inserting a picture and sizing it.  The Picture Tools Format tab is added to the end of the ribbon when a picture is selected.  When using JAWS, it appears after you list objects using CTRL with Shift and O and press enter key on one of the items in the list to select it.  The picture tools include many options including the sizing of the objects mentioned in the above steps. 
 
Take care.

Q&A on Skype 8.51 and my JAWS scripts,"This is my attempt to address several questions and concerns expressed both on and off this list regarding Skype 8.51 and/or my scripts for it. This message covers Skype 8.51, the JAWS scripts for Skype 8, and SLMan, the Script Load Manager needed by users of the Skype 8 scripts with older JAWS versions. This message does not address NVDA or my Skype add-on; I hope to do that in a separate message. This message is in Q&A format.

Q: Why don't I see the Split View Mode option in Skype 8.51?

A: There are a few possible reasons:

1. The option is under a ""More Options"" button on the main screen. It is not found in the menus available from any menu bar.

2. The option's presence or absence appears to be governed by code managed centrally by Microsoft without requiring an update to the Skype application installed on your computer. This is my guess, based on my observations, and is thus subject to correction; however, I have heard multiple reports of the option appearing and possibly disappearing without a Skype update installation.

Q: I'm hearing that Microsoft will or did pull back the Split Screen Mode option. Is this true?

A: I have no solid confirmation one way or the other except for what has been posted on this list. However, as of this writing (August 30, 2019), the option remains active in my personal Skype 8 installation. While writing this message, I upgraded from 8.51.0.86 to 8.51.0.92; and the Split View Mode option is still present. I take this to mean that the option is either staying for now or has already been removed and put back by this time. Again though, I am guessing.

Q: Why does JAWS no longer say things like ""Message sent,"" ""so and so is typing,"" ""Message has been edited,"" etc.?

A: This happens if you use Split View Mode. These messages are posted to the main Skype window. JAWS announces such messages, which are ""live region"" messages, when they are posted to the window in focus. However, when you use Split View Mode, the window in focus is a chat and not the main Skype window where the messages are sent. Scripting might be able to rectify this issue for JAWS users, but I'm betting Microsoft fixes it for everyone in some way. Guessing again though; this is not based on any Microsoft feedback.

Q: Do I need to use the Script Load Manager, SLMan?

A: Only if you are using a JAWS version that is older than the last August update to JAWS 2019. The symptom of needing SLMan when you don't have it is that JAWS' Insert+Q command will say that Chrome settings instead of Skype 8 settings are loaded when you type that command from inside a Skype window.

Q: Can I still change the Skype Command key for the scripts if I have to use SLMan?

A: The short answer is Yes. The longer answer is Yes but you might have to edit a file yourself rather than using the normal command for this purpose, which is the sequence [ JAWSKey+C. I still need to address this issue.

Q: How do I manually set a Skype Command key?

A: Edit skypeelectron.jcf in your JAWS user folder. In that file, add or edit the following section:

[MKCSOptions]
CommandKey=Shift+Enter

Of course, replace Shift+Enter with what you prefer.

At this writing, if you find a slman.jcf file in your JAWS user folder, it should be sufficient simply to add the contents of that file to the end of your skypeelectron.jcf, or replace the [MKCSOptions] section in it if it exists, with the contents of slman.jcf; then delete slman.jcf. This slman.jcf creation is the issue I need to address when I can.

Go DodgersI can tell you with certainty, that the buy part can easily enough, you just need to use headings commands and know the basics of page navigation.
Use headings as well as buttons, like the submit bid button, and the E key to find the edit field so you can enter a bid.
I search for the word DESC to find the description.
Search for shipp for shipping to find out how much the shipping is.
That is with two Ps.
Use C for the category search.
And if looking for computer and networking, press D and up arrow, because there are a lot of Cs in the list.
Oh yeah, you'll need a PayPal account, and it is nice the way it can go directly to your PayPal and enter the transaction for you.

I have it where it goes to the media buttons on me when I want and have gotten it to the like and dis like buttons. Even on Dell it keeps moving on me too.

--Douglas Adams, from Life, The Universe and Everything, p.59Robert,
Since you reposted your message for posterity, I'll follow with my same reply for others, as I have done a lot of buying on eBay.
 
I can tell you with certainty, that the buy part can easily enough, you just need to use headings commands and know the basics of page navigation.
Use headings as well as buttons, like the submit bid button, and the E key to find the edit field so you can enter a bid.
I search for the word DESC to find the description.
Search for shipp for shipping to find out how much the shipping is.
That is with two Ps.
Use C for the category search.
And if looking for computer and networking, press D and up arrow, because there are a lot of Cs in the list.
Oh yeah, you'll need a PayPal account, and it is nice the way it can go directly to your PayPal and enter the transaction for you.
 
HTH.
GlennI don't sell on EBay, but I shop there all the time using the EBay advanced search page.?? Shopping on EBay is like browsing the world's largest 99 cent store.?? I have purchased dozens of items for less than a buck, which is actually less than I would pay at my local 99 cent store, which charges sales tax.?? It must cost these sellers more than 99 cents to ship these items from China or Hong Kong, so I don't know how they makemoney. For instance, I recently purchased a pair of oven mitts on EBay for only 99 cents shipped.?? My local 99 cent store charges $1.49 plus tax for only one mitt.?? So what if it sometimes takes a few weeks to receive the item??? The EBay advanced page is completely accessible with JAWS.?? Happy shopping.



Gerald Some states are now charging tax for on-line items.
Nebraska has started this now, the big sellers like eBay and Amazon are complying.
GlennI have bought on eBay with Jaws. 
I don't see why one couldn't sell on eBay, but I usually get others to load the photos of the product because having photos seems to greatly improve the chances of a sale and increase the price if you are auctioning an item.

Go DodgersHi Robert,
instead of using the shortcut ctrl + shift + v, open the context menu and choose Move to folder. An identical looking dialog opens, but the tree view is accessible. It's a very strange quirk.

David.Do the following.
1. got to the letter that you want to move.
2. tap your application key which on a normal keyboard is the very first button on the lower write of your normal keyboard.
If you fine the long zero button on your calculator keypad, follow it to the left until you get to the normal keyboard, it will be the very first button you come to.
3. Tap the app key until you come to move to folder, or you can simply tap the letter v which is the short cut.
That’s just the letter V by itself with no additional keys.
4. up or down arrow until you fine the mailbox you want to place it in.
5. tab over to the ok button and abuse either enter key and or the spacebar and you just moved that letter from one mailbox to the new mailbox.
6. If you want to move more than one letter to the same mailbox,
You don’t have to go looking for the mailbox since it knows where you were at the last time you moved a letter.
Unless you tap your up and or down arrow keys.
Simply tab over to the ok button or if I remember correctly at any time you can skip the ok button but simply just abusing either of the enter keys and or the spacebar.
Hope this advice was helpful.

Hi Bob,
 
You can check and change your cap pitch using the steps below.  I have my cap pitch set at 27 so I can tell caps a little easier.
 
1. Press, Insert + J, to open the Jaws context menu, then press the letter, O, to open options, or arrow down to, Options, and press enter.
2. Press the letter, V, to open the Voices submenu, or down arrow to, submenu Voices, and press enter.
3. Press enter on, Voice adjustment...
4. Tab 5 times to, Voice adjust combobox, All Contexts, and in here is where you'll find the caps pitch setting by tabbing a few times.
5. Now down arrow to find the PC cursor, Jaws cursor, Keyboard and Tutor message voices.  Tab on each of these to find voice rate and pitch change settings. 
If you make any changes make sure that you apply and okay them to save them.  If you change the cap pitch in the all contexts dialogue it'll cover all cursors.

I mean, I’ve got no problem leaving those boxes checked, but if there’s any impact positive or otherwise by changing them, I’d like to know so I can make the necessary adjustments.Hi Cristóbal,
 
Below are various comments / posts from the link I posted earlier.
 
 * Autoscrolling if unchecked will not allow the scrolling you get by clicking the mouse scroll button.
Smooth Scrolling if unchecked will when rolling the mouse, jerkily move the requisite number of lines.
 

 * I unticked both of them but see no changes in the browsing. Wonder what they do.
 

 * I unticked both the boxes and restarted the FF.
Smooth scrolling unchecked moves the page by predetermined jump in lines. When checked, it is smoother.
 
But autoscrolling unchecked/checked didn't make a difference with the mouse scroll button.
 

 * If you want to scroll down the page faster, press the scroll button while moving the cursor up or down. Auto scroll has to be ticked to enable this.

Question: How to Use the Touch Screen Keyboard,"Hello. I'm running JAWS 2019 using Windows 10 build 1803 on a Dell Lattitude 2-in-1 device with a touch screen, along with a detachable keyboard.

I have been asked to deliver a demo regarding the touch screen gestures used by JAWS. As I make my way through the relevant help topic in the JAWS help system I am having little difficulty with most of the gestures, except for one. I am not able to invoke the on-screen keyboard using the four finger swipe down/up gesture. At first I had wondered if the on-screen keyboard would not be available if the physical keyboard was attached. However, even after removing the keyboard the gesture still doesn't work. I have so far tried doing this in Word 365 and in Wordpad. What's the secret to accessing the on-screen keyboard? Should it not work in Word and in Wordpad? I welcome any feedback from any users who have experience with this.

"Quoting in Skype, why it does not work on my hand?","Hi guys,
    Skype has recently been updated to 8.56, and on the release notes
      they say they improved quoting on skype. There should be a new
      checkbox under Settings / Messaging, someting like ""Paste copied
      messages as quotes"", but I can't find it. I thought it was a
      localization issue at first msince I use Skype in Italian, but
      even by temporarily setting it in English no go. Do you think it's
      something gradually rolling out to users like Split view was at
      the beginning?
    Note that they say it's not available in Skype for Windows 10,
      but I think they refer to version 14.x; even if I use Windows 10
      as my OS, I use Skype 8.56 for desktop.
    Bye!

Raising hands in Skype 8.66,"Hi guys,

I read the release notes of Skype 8.66 and figured out that now it's possible to raise our hands in Skype meetings, and putting them back down of course. How should we make it? I can't find a hotkey, do you think it's then necessary to scroll the call window?

Note that both Skype for Windows desktop and Mac can be useful, so don't think that just because you're only on a Mac you won't help me.

Bye!

      it from Skypes websites and saw that the scripts are working ok
      but I am able to find split view, so it's possibly only available
      in the Windows store version. Let's see what happens when some
      newer version come out.

Mail for Windows 10I'm a bit reluctant to reply to this, but I will...

The word ""refused"" in your post is probably a rough translation and not intended as a statement that I was unwilling to help you. Just in case of any confusion though, my response to your request was, ""Your config file is
correct, and since the issue is about the scripts not loading at all, nothing I can do with scripting could
address the issue.""

Beyond that though, you are now coming to a public list and officially requesting help with using an illegal copy of JAWS. I don't police the use of JAWS, nor do I work to prevent people from using my scripts in illegal copies; but I
also do not specifically support them.

There may well be JAWS installations out there that do not update regularly for corporate or similar reasons; so whenever I can get my machine to install Skype 8.51, I hope to examine this situation before updating to the
latest JAWS myself.That's why I err on the side of caution, and stick with what works, until something is properly recommended.

I'm using script revision 113 with the latest version of Skype, and as far as I can tell, it's working perfectly.

But, I'll be watching for any info on a split view in any newer version.to update your jaws, do you have to pay?

João Nuno AntunesIt depends on whether you have any sma’s left.Mine is set so it updates the version I'm using automatically.
    Downloaded updates to JAWS    2019 just last week.Hi Joao Provided you have a legal version of jaws, you don’t have to pay for the regular updates, i.e, from jaws 19.06 to 19.07.  If you don’t have an SMA (service management agreement) left, you would be required to pay to update jaws from 2019 to 2020.Hello João,
If  you  have  JAWS  2019 already, no, you don't have to pay anything.
Updates during one version of JAWS are always free.

Re: A pair of questions regarding Skype for Windows 10,"Hey Mich, I think I can help in your case...

Since you have quite an old JAWS version, apart from the Skype scripts which you however should make sure are installed, you will need to install the scripts load manager as well. Point your browser at www.dlee.org/slman and download the installer.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Interesting that your friend's system is not running my scripts as expected. Make sure you restarted JAWS once after installing my scripts, because JAWS often won't see changes to the ConfigNames.ini file, which decides which
scripts to load for which application, until JAWS is restarted.

As for launching the Store version of Skype, I just type ""Skype"" into the Start search box and press Enter. I'm not sure how to make a Desktop shortcut for that version, but I never needed to try. Of course it is also
possible to make Skype automatically load on system start; it's a checkbox in Settings.Hi Doug, thanks for your response. We effectively did not restart JAWS, so that's possibly why the scripts were not recognized properly. I'll check it out by calling her in the next days and we'll see what happens, but considering I also installed the latest Windows updates which required a system restart, it's possible that now it works ok.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10I have to use it for my job, so I still use it. and clients do not want to use another application and learn one. We want to make it as easy for our clients and skype sadly is it. Teams could be used, but that's only for work stuff. By the way my clients  for some of them, they have never heard of skype.

Finally, to become a patron and help support the podcast go hereHi Sarah,
 
When other people complaint that they had a problem 
with Skype 8, you didn't care and didn't like their messages, just because that 
time Skype 8 was good enough for you, even if most people were using Skype for 
Windows. You said:
""Actually I'm loving skype 8 for mac. It is accessible, 
fast, stable and very easy to use. I've already sent some video messages, files, 
media, taught my classes, chatted and more. Now if only they would allow the 
pins and list that I have on windows skype but maybe that will come up. Rocking 
and loving skype 8 for mac."".
 
I guess that now you don't consider the negative 
messages about Skype 8 as beeing something bad anymore, once that Skype 8 is 
also bad for you.
The so call constructive solutions praised on this 
mailing list were to contact MS customer care and not to say negative things 
here
 
You said: ""I love 
love love love love windows 10. It is snappy and just works out of the box. I 
can turn on narrator with windows control enter and set up my system. It just 
plane rocks. I'm still learning windows 10 but microsoft has taken leaps and 
bounds in terms of accessibility. I'm also a part of their insider program and I 
also love that as well."".
 
My suggestion is to start using Windows 10 if you 
say that you like it so much, and you will see how good is Skype 8 under this 
OS.
 
PS. Sorry, but it was just a joke. Of course I 
don't recommend you to use this bad app under this bad OS, at least for the 
moment.
If a theatre is really bad made, then maybe even 
the firemen don't have access to extinguish the fire, so it might be 
abandoned.
 
--OctavianHi Sarah,
 
Here are 4 suggestions I found in the mailing list 
archive (that were made when somebody else had problems with Skype 
8:)
 
From: Sarah k Alawami 
The point is, that we are seeing way too much 
talk and no action
. Someone does not like something and they just complain 
instead of hitting windows f and submitting feedback on said app(s) Microsoft 
does in fact listen. I am an insider and have ben for about a year on 1 of their 
platforms and they do listen. They have fixed several bugs on skype for xbox and 
windows and mac. So, get that feedback in instead of just wishing for somethingn 
to happen. If you don't like it, there's the door, and you can uninstall skype 
off of your system, and find somethingn that is better such as facebook or zoom 
for that matter, but put your energy to constructive feedback stacks reports, 
diag logs etc.
 
From: Sarah k Alawami 
Then sit down, write your feedback to skype 
directly and not here. We have already heard it. If you you don't like it there 
is always zoom or the delete key. You tend to sound like a broken record and we 
are starting to not like it. You in this case and on this list are the minority 
as you are I hink the only one who is hating skype and its new ways. Either get 
used to it, get left behind, or leave. I'm speaking as a list member, not a 
mod.
 
Sarah k Alawami wrote:
Actually all of them are advantages. I don't like 
when people, and I've heard this on twitter, not this list, say that skype 8 is 
inaccessible because it's too hard to use. Not enough people are giving this a 
chance in my humble opinion. I've ben sing it since prabably October off and on 
and it has come a long long way. It is faster than 7, easier than 7, and yeah, 
just works.
 
From: Shaun Oliver 
Whenever I see an email from you regarding Skype, it 
is a never ending litany of charges against it's ease of use, that it's worse 
than what you had, it's less accessible, it's less efficient, it's this, it's 
that, or it's the other.
We've heard every single complaint you've raised 
before, and reitterating them here, is not going to change what currently is. If 
you feel that strongly about it, contact the MS Disability Access Desk and 
kindly present them with your arguments.

 
--OctavianActually I'm still rocking it, I can still do  everything  I need to do, I even love the accessible messages that show up in the html view. The only thing  I don't like now  is that on  least on mobile I'm missing notifications and they don't sync properly on skype for anything. They show up as read even though I never read them. Maybe with a skype update that will be fixed. I am though hoping we can use teams at my job as it will be a lot easier then I can see where things go.Already done. And there is now not a feedback utility for mac and skype as far as I can see.

    First thing I should say is, if you configured typing echo to
      characters or both characters and words, you may lose some
      notifications, not only Skype ones, because they appear just a
      moment before you type a letter. Apart from that, afaik, Skype
      does not send notifications and ""message sent"" indications if
      split view is active; I don't remember technical reasons for this,

Finally, to become a patron and help support the podcast go hereA few clarifications:

Which Skype version and version number? Skype Desktop and Skype UWP are the versions, and Desktop versions start with 8 whereas UWP versions start with 14.

If you're using JAWS, what is the script revision number spoken when you type Insert+q in the Skype window?

Do you mean the clicking typing sound, or the ""Message sent"" announcements when you send a message, or something else?

Answers for various cases:

In Skype Desktop, the typing clicks should work in both regular and split views, but ""Message sent"" etc. do not speak in split view because of how that announcement is implemented by Skype itself. If your JAWS scripts are too
old, typing sounds might not work in split view.

In Skype UWP, typing sounds are not working at this time due to major changes in the display since I wrote the scripts; and ""Message sent"" etc. are not supported by Skype itself as far as I know.Skype 8.55.0.141 with script revision 137.

The typing sound works in single view, and the indescribable sound as well when a message comes in.

Jaws 2020.Ok, let me integrate what Doug already said...
    One more thing that does not work in split view is Skype native
      typing announcement, meaning that JAWS won't say that your contact
      is currently typing. If you want to hear these announcements in
      split view, you'll have to check JAWS' proper typing announcement,
      and you do that by pressing JAWSKey+v from within Skype in order
      to open the quick settings, and check the ""typing announce""
      option.

Re: Chrome Legacy,"Thanks, Leonie.

I also discovered that downloading the new version from the website, instead of installing the new update via notification seems to have helped.

The simulated right click works for a while, then, it pops up again.

The fresh download may have worked.I'm still getting it after a fresh download.
So, any ideas would be welcome.


Jerry.It's definitely a persistent bug in the programme, rather than a glitch I think, though reinstallation often helps. I've also discovered that hitting alt f to open the File menu, then closing it again, does the trick too. It's very irritating though. I've mentioned it to the MS team.I let them know too.

Thanks again.No, but I'm getting it too. I've found that randomly using Jaws to simulate a mouse click in the Skype UI sometimes clears it though, in case that's helpful.

      is, the correct key is ctrl+shift+p with Skype for Windows for

Re: Cortana,"Hello, actually I did not realize there was this possibility through
    Skype, I don't know if it's because I use a wireless headset and my
    Windows machine is a desktop one so no built-in mic.

    Anyway yes it's a voice assistant like Alexa or Siri by Apple. You
    can call it also by pressing windows+c.

    Thinking it good, since it's a Microsoft product and Skype has been
    bought by MS since some years it's not so strange...

    BarbuzHello Jerry,

I'm thinkin it's  similar to Alexa.Well,   sort   of.   It's   a  voice  assistant  from  Microsoft,  but
unfortunately far not so good as Google's or Amazon's assistants.

Subject: [skypeenglish] Cortana


      Hi all.


Does anyone know what Cortana is?

It appears on my version of skype 8.44.0.40, and in the search list at 
the start menu.

There's an option that says ""talk to cortana.""

I'm thinkin it's  similar to Alexa.

I'm a new windows 10 user. lol

Jerry.Good evening all,

I moved into Windows 10 about 6 months ago and that's when I first
experienced Cortana.

I found it to be extremely  annoying the way it kept popping up
during everything I tried to do, and how it kept pulling Jaws focus away
from what I was working on.

The reason I mention this is because if it's now going to become a
component of Skype I don't see this as good news.

It's very pernicious as it seems to go into and take over all functions
of Windows 10 almost like it was a virus.

If more people in this community find that it's going to be a problem
with us using Skype  maybe we can open a discussion on how to
disable it.

On the other hand if we find in time that it helps us use Skype better
then that information would also be of value to share.


Thanks to all of you who work so hard to figure out these kind of
issues.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10By now I have a diagnosis but not a solution. Short version: The problem resulted from my renaming skypeelectron.jsb to skype.jsb for some reason. If I rename it back and change ConfigNames.ini accordingly, the problem
goes away.

Longer explanation: JAWS normally reads the names of the various controls that contain the focused control when you Alt+Tab into an application. Skype has no less than three container controls named Skype. The repetitions
are just JAWS dutifully reading them all one at a time.

The JAWS scripts for Skype that come with JAWS include code to avoid much of this repetition. My scripts also include code to avoid it, but it's not the same code. In current Skype versions, the JAWS code works better than mine.

I believe that, when the files were named skypeelectron instead of just Skype, the JAWS scripts for Skype that came with JAWS briefly loaded before mine did. The result was that the JAWS code fixed the repetition problem
during the very brief moment it was running. Of course I didn't know this was happening, so I assumed my method of fixing the problem was still working.
I could be wrong about the stock scripts briefly running, but it explains why things work if I rename my scripts again.

I will need to update how I handle the repetition when it is caused by JAWS reading legitimate control names on Skype focus.Hello Barbuz,
    

    
    I'm sure you're right about the number 1. For some time mine says
      1 new notification when I first load skype. Just haven't been too
      concerned with it, lol.
    

    
    GaryDoug,


I knew as soon as  you could duplicate it you would have a diagnosis. You never have let grass grow under  your feet. smile


GaryI get a couple of repeats when Skype takes focus, one of which includes the word ""page""; but I have not yet tackled that one. When I noticed it this morning, actually before I made any script changes I think, I figured something
changed in Skype 8.61 that I hadn't noticed before.Doug,


I just uninstalled 173 and re-installed 162. Sure something going on there.

    I'm not convinced chrome works with jaws, likewise firefox.I just discovered something.
    When i get the not commonly downloaded message, I tabbed over to
      something  called Actions.
    I clicked on it, and it took me to something called smart screen,
      with an option, Don't Run This program.
    Does that mean anything, and should I click on that option?
    It says, JFW Skype.exe is not commonly downloaded and may harm
      your computer, after a security scan.I think the reason I don't have issues is I use nvda, I don't use jaws anymore, not unless I have to which I have not since 2010.

Re: Early report on Skype 8.51's Split View and the Skype8 JAWS scripts,"I’m very sorry to let you know that this is a very bad news specially for those of us who cannot upgrade from JAWS 2018 to JAWS 2019.As far as myself is concern, I became very much disappointed and at the end I have uninstalled JAWS script for Skype electron version 121.I therefore would like to request Doug Lee to sort something out for those who cannot upgrade JAWS 2019.I sincerely hope that my request will be considered as earliest manner.With regards from Inamuddin with the Skype ID:Charlsdarwin1  arguing with a woman is just like reading software’s lisence agreement.At the end you ignore Her everything  and click I agree button.You can contact me via gmail:inamuddin09@...outlook:inam092@...yahoo:inamuddin2010@...AOL:charlsdarwin1969@...Join me with my Skype ID:charlsdarwin1See me on facebook:www.facebook.com/inamuddin786Follow me on my twitter:www.twitter.com/charlsdarwin1Mobile phone:+92-334-3348409Google voice:+1-631-5335683Not sure why you say it's bad news. I'm saying most things can work under older JAWS versions if you update ConfigNames.ini as I described. The one thing I'm not sure I can address for older JAWS versions is the JAWSKey+V issue.

My tests this morning find that the Index=skypeelectron trick in ConfigNames.ini alsow works in JAWS 2018, as does about:blank=skypeelectron for separate chat windows.

For JAWS 18.0 and 17.0, use Index.html=skypeelectron and about=skypeelectron instead.

I must again say though, these tricks may well interfere with other web applications, because other web apps may also use such plain domain names for their content. JAWS is being updated to handle problems like this, and
sometimes it is just not possible for a script to fix something in a JAWS version that is not written to handle it. :-)The matter of fact is that I have removed (.html) and it was:
Index=skype electron
But it was having two problems.
1.
It doesn’t work in separate chat meaning that if I’m in a chat window, it doesn’t work.
2.
If I press insirt+v it says chrome setting rather than Skype quick setting.
Due to these two things, I was forced to remove JAWS script for Skype electron.
Another thing I’d like to point out  is that this problem occurs when I enable split view in case of disable split view, it is working fine but insert+V problem is there either if I use enable split view or disable split view.
At the end I was having 2 options either I leave using split view or remove JAWS script for Skype electron.
I chose the second option because I like using split view very much and I was waiting for that feature since   ages.
I tried my level best to rub any kind of misunderstanding.
I also hope that my detailed explanation will help Doug Lee to make JAWS script for Skype electron which  could be  used in all JAWS versions   specially in JAWS 2018.
At The end, all I can say is that for the sake of JAWS script for skype, my last hope since 2010 is Doug Lee.

Finally, to become a patron and help support the podcast go hereFrequently discussed in various places nowadays, and it's a change in Skype 8.63 and is not due to Windows 10 2004. The workarounds are to tap Alt twice, tap Alt and then Esc, or use Windows+DownArrow followed by
Windows+UpArrow whenever this happens. Microsoft Teams suffered a similar misfortune within the last few months. That one was fixed within Teams itself, and I expect the same will happen to Skype; however, rumor has it that
this issue is not fixed in the beta of Skype 8.64.

"Re: I think Skype is dead, daad, dead","Well, Lino. You are running Skype version 8.68, and I just yesterday to the Skype website, and updated to version 8.71. If you want to give up that easily, it's your choice. But I'd rather see them develop something that works, instead of developing something it will take them several builds to fix any bugs.

Bill White

billwhite92701@...Well, 8.71 came out a little while ago.

AlanI just update when the updater comes up when I reboot Windows. 
JohnHi, John. That's usually what I do, too, but I heard people talking about version 8.71, and I only had 8.68, and the updater didn't give me 8.71, so I went to the website to update.

Bill White

billwhite92701@...8.71.0.49

That's what came down in the automatic update.  So, I uninstalled it after restarting the system, because the sounds weren't working.

After a fresh download from skype.com, it seems to be OK so far.

I'm checking regularly for messages, just in case.

The ringtone when a call comes in works, and the hang up sound.

The typing and the incoming message sounds don't seem to work.Hello guys, starting from the end, as I said yesterday on my case
      sounds are effectively working, only thing that comes to my mind
      is that possibly the sound for an incoming message can be a little
      lower than the other ones, but I actually was having my headphones
      when I got them yesterday.
    Talking about versions instead, they also launched 8.69 for a
      certain period but it apparently has been retired, at least for
      Windows. What I normally do instead is as follows: I consult
      https://ninite.com for checking if there are updates of my
      program, and when I see one of Skype I immediately go to download
      the installer from its website. So, summarizing, here are my
      suppositions:
    

    
    
      
        the Skype autoupdater is not working, at least not for every user;-- 

      
      
        if you're using Skype for Windows 10 (formerly Skype uwp), chances are there is an issue in the Microsoft Store for Skype updates.

Bill White
billwhite92701@...hi bill

https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/download-skype-for-desktop/There is an issue in JAWS that sometimes requires a JAWS restart after a script installation before the scripts will load. I forgot about this when I wrote you earlier. The technical issue is that changes to ConfigNames.ini may
not be detected until JAWS restarts, and the script installer adds an entry to that file that is responsible for loading the scripts when you switch focus into Skype.

Sorry I forgot to mention that one sooner, but glad things are working now.hi bill

I don't think there's anything specific but you will find all you need
to know at the below website.

http://dlee.org/skype/electron/skypeelectron.htmHey Bill, welcome back to Skype!
    I'd like to just add a thing which I am not sure is clearly
      explained on Doug's scripts for Skype electron user's guide, that
      is the link that Stephen already gave you. In Skype version 8.51
      and later, it is now possible to activate the split view mode in
      order to have separate chat windows, just like it was in older
      versions of Skype. If you want to do so, just press tab till you
      find ""More options"" menu button, press space, choose ""Enable split
      view mode"" with arrows, and press enter here. Beware though that
      in split view mode some indications are not spoken by JAWS, and
      possibly NVDA as well but I'm not sure of the latter, such as
      ""message sent"".
    Bye!

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Hi, Stephen. I downloaded Skype, but I think it is the wrong version, not Skype 8 for desktop (electron). This is because I am running JAWS 2020, and Doug Lee says that when I press INSERT plus Q, I should get a script revision number if Skype is in focus and the Skype scripts are installed correctly. Where can I download the correct (electron) version of Skype?

Thank you.

Mr. Alexander Scott KaiserHi Alexander and all, here it's the direct link for Skype 8 electron scripts installer: http://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/jfw_skypeelectron.exe

You will hear revision 129 instead of 130 when pressing insert+q after scripts installation, and possibly even during scripts install; this is normal and harmless. Anyway, no matter the revision number, these scripts should work properly with JAWS 2020; I did not have the chance to update yet, but chatting with Doug he told me there shouldn't be problems. What you can do is try installing them and report here any issues you'll encounter.

"Re: JAWS Skype script revision 220 released, to fix issues in Skype 8.82","You will probably need to translate the scConvList constant in the XML file to avoid that message. The command
still works because it will simulate the native Alt+1 command when it can't find the field.Thanks for your answer Doug, I'll think about that string translation...

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Thanks Doug,

I just downloaded the revised scripts and installed them.

Thanks very much for all you do to keep the scripts updated!

AlanTwo things I missed in my earlier reply:

First, there is another cause of that message: If you type Alt+1 while in a split-view window (a separate chat
window) or an active call window, the field really won't be in the window; but the Alt+1 will then be sent to
Skype and will switch focus to the main Skype window.

Second, the translation for the scConvList constant must be exactly, including letter casing, the name of the
Conversations list in Skype itself.Hi Doug, thanks for the report about new revision of the Skype scripts which I just installed, and also for the answer on the other thread about Windows defender. The alt+1 fix that you made is actually causing a strange situation with this command when using revision 220: even if the conversations list pops up normally, it tells me ""field not found"".

Does it remove old scripts, and replace them as usual?Answering several messages at once:

Jerry: If you are running Skype UWP now, wait for that to update, or update it from the Microsoft Store, before installing the updated scripts. If you are using Skype for Windows Desktop now, you can update the scripts
immediately.

Octavian: Skype for Windows Desktop has not changed since 8.61; the Skype change is in Skype for Windows 10. The effects on Windows 7 users are these:

1. In the NVDA add-on, I fixed the review cursor in messages in message history.

2. In the JAWS scripts, file names changed, and there are other updates as listed in the release notes.

Bill and John: My script installers create an item under the Start menu rather than adding to Programs and Features so the installer will not require admin rights to run.

John: Sorry about being an unsigned publisher. I may change that someday, but that costs money and can be a hassle to set up. Browsers typically warn against Internet executable downloads but will permit you to run them
after you get past the warnings. I am not a regular Edge user though, so I don't have specific steps for you.Hi, John. To be able to download the JAWS Scripts For Skype for Windows,

1. Open Microsoft Edge.
2. Press ALT.

4. In Settings, navigate to Privacy and Services, and press ENTER.
5. TAB to Microsoft Defender SmartScreen check box, and uncheck it. This

The ""Windows has protected your PC"" message is one I see often when launching installers and programs downloaded from the Internet. If you are unsure whether the file is safe, you should of course not run it. Windows is trying
to help avoid virus and malware attacks by warning users when they are about to run something that came from the Internet. However, the message is not itself an indication that the installer is infected or malicious.Do I just keep trying until it works?hi Gerry and all

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Michele,


It only happens if you have an active voice conversation going? Not here. It happens all the time with  no conversation. Strange, it just started happening in the last few days. Before that it worked well. I was using your method of routing jaws to pc to find contacts and then reversing that such as routing pc back  with insert num pad plus. Then the conversation list worked well.


GaryHi Gary, I just tested JAWS cursor and on my hand it works fine. Anyway, if you didn't already, try to upgrade Skype to 8.78, lists should work better now even without routing cursors. If you have the impression they won't work, just go around with tab.

Re: Jaws losing focus with Skype for Business 2015 running,"Hi again Doug

Just to let you know I managed to get SFB 2016 installed today.  Iwas so looking forward to the problem being gone, but for some reason it isn't.
I haven't tried installing your scripts for SFB 2016 yet as it's been a busy Friday, but on Monday I'll try.
Just wanted to let you know in case you were still planning to do some work on creating that beta version for the 2015 scripts to recognise Jaws 2020.

Thanks, FrancoisTo all other listers: The below refers only to Skype For Business and its predecessor Lync, not to the consumer-grade Skype products.

I have split the SFB/Lync scripts into three different branches, as follows:

365: The current SFB scripts, aimed at the SFB in Office 365. This branch is at https://www.dlee.org/sfb/365/

15: The script support for Microsoft Lync 2013 and Skype For Business versions from 2015 and 2016 (early SFB 2016). This branch is up to date and is at https://www.dlee.org/sfb/15/

16: The script support for Skype For Business 2016, before it was rolled into Office 365. This branch is not yet complete but will appear at https://www.dlee.org/sfb/16/

When all three branches are complete, I will replace https://www.dlee.org/sfb/ with a page that just connects to the other three. For now though, that page remains the multi-branch page it has been for years.

You are welcome to try the 15 branch, though I'm not sure if that might be a step backward depending on the scripts you now have.Hi list

I thought perhaps my vacation leave would take care of the problem but obviously not. 
The email trail is below, but in brief I need to have a group conversation open for the duration of my work shift.  Each time a team member posts something to this team chat Jaws loses focus of the application I was last working on.  A good example of that is that I might be navigating a Word document in the Quick Keys review mode (jaws-z) when the SFB message comes in.  Jaws now thinks we're in the SFB application and the quick keys mode in Word is no longer active.
In case it helps, when the SFB message comes in, pressing Jaws-t to read the widow title Jaws announces Skype for Business.
However, pressing Jaws-q to check which scripts are running Jaws would still announce the scripts name for the application I am actually focused on.
I would appreciate any help on things I can try to resolve this.

I'm running Skype for Business 2016 here at work under what looks likeWindows 8.1. Info as per the Winver command:

""Revision 385 Lync 2013 and Skype for Business settings are used in the lync.exe application.
The configuration name is lync.""

Thanks for any help.
FrancoisI actually spent a fairly significant amount of time arranging the scripts for this application into three branches, all of which can be found at https://www.dlee.org/sfb/

I don't have a way to test older versions, so my idea of what should be in the older two of those may be off a bit; but if either of the last two branches on that page help you, please let me know.

I admit, though, this issue you're having is reminiscent to me of a general issue I've been seeing in several applications. Off the top of my head, they include Skype UWP (the Windows 10 alternative to Skype for Windows
Desktop) and Unigram (a Windows Telegram client that is more accessible than the native Telegram client on Windows).

The general issue I've seen is that certain types of events that cause a system tray alert to appear can also confuse JAWS' idea of which application has focus. I wonder if this is a JAWS issue because I'm not aware of it
occurring under NVDA; but I could be wrong there. I regard the acid test for this issue to be pretty clear: If you Alt+Tab twice, you should land back in the same app that had focus in the first place according to Windows,
right? So when this issue occurs and you Alt+Tab twice, you land back in the app you were working in, not the one that generated the systray alert and confused JAWS' idea of focus.

Let me know if any of the SFB/Lync script versions help you. Also I recommend contacting Freedom/Vispero if the issue is not addressed by those; and I honestly suspect that no script will currently fix this one. Sometimes
though, I would love to be wrong. :-)Wow, didn't know any SFB version that old was still in use out there.

I may vaguely recall that focus issue, but I believe that was fixed within SFB itself. I did not try to script around that one as far as I remember.

I'm somewhat surprised that the SFB 2015 scripts won't install into JAWS 2020, but the code could require an update. If you like, I can generate an updated beta; though I have no way to test it here. I'm just not expecting an
update to help with the focus problem you are reporting, annoying though I'm sure that issue is for you.

You might see if a Do Not Disturb status will prevent that issue, assuming your management doesn't mind you staying in that status and assuming it doesn't make you miss things you need to see. You could also try putting SFB
on another virtual desktop if your Windows version allows that, but I have never tried that one myself to know if it would help.Windows 8.1 Pro.  Is that an old version of windows, if memory serves?

Could that be part of the problem?I'm thinking that. Is there a timeline where your company will upgrade to windows 10?

Thanks for your responses and yes, while Windows 8.1 is rather outdated, I'm new to the company and low in the pecking order without strategic contacts at this early stage, so I have no idea how to find out when they plan to roll out newer versions for either SFB or Windows.  Even if that's planned for later in the year I will have lost my mind long before that lol.

I tried the Do Not Disturb suggestion, but all it does is no longer playing a sound when a new message comes in.  The Jaws focus still jumps to the message, sort of.

Doug I'm wondering whether your scripts look for Jaws under a specific folder and my setup might simply be not what the scripts are expecting?
If it's not too much trouble I'll take you up on the offer to generate an updated beta and I'm happy to try it out myself.  I'm kinda desperate.

Re: Leaving the group and deleteing Skype,"I thought that teams was only to do with groups. I like the way skype is at the moment, but it does need a little bit more tweaking, but it's miles better than what it was.I probably wouldn’t even worry about it.Well it had better be better than what I have now, and I like this one. Why can't they just fix what they have and be done with that damned thing.well i am only telling you how it is from my pc r u calling me a lyerWell that was telling us wasn't it. In fact I have found that skype is just about the same as before, and it seems to be much easier to handle. Have I just got the patience or what? Remember how we used to use alt1 to find our favorite contacts, well it's back.I haven't checked it out yet.  But, somewhere in the options/settings section, isn't there a Classic option.  I thought I saw it there recently, but never checked it out.Ah, Lino, in case you still see this... I've always seen you as both blunt and quick to move. This has pros
and cons of course.

I find that in Skype 8.72, the long hated delay on opening a new conversation is completely gone. This of
course does not by itself indicate that Skype will live forever, but I'd say it does indicate continuing
development.

I continue to use Skype, though I prefer Telegram and specifically Unigram these days.If that's the case, I never found it that way. When I went for the update, it was already there.That's probably true.  I only found it recently.I'm currently running Skype version 8.73 and I've noticed that they finally brought back the check boxes where we can easily add people to the call that's currently in progress. This version appears to work fine with Jaws. However, it'd be nice if they'd bring back the start up and shut down sounds, as well as the ability to change skype sounds and give us back the sound that would tell you that someone is trying to call, even while you're already in an active call. I still have yet to find out what the mobile version of skype is like, but because of the darn touch screen keyboard, this is quite a challenege. I mean challenge. I think due to the multitudes of complaints sent in to them even by our sighted counter parts, they're slowly starting to get the message that they've got to put back the accessability. We'll certainly miss you Lino.

For those who talked about some classic thing, I just checked cin the Mac version since I am now out of home, I found out something but it is actually about color. What they gave us is actually the possibility to have a double  window for having separate chats.

Re: Missing characters when typing messages in Skype with JAWS,"I haven't noticed any coincidence between spelling corrections and dropped characters, but I have occasionally
noticed dropped characters and have done my best to reduce the frequency of this issue, mostly by suspending
the typing sounds while you are typing into that box. That's why you may notice that the typing sound for the
other person stops for a few seconds every time you start typing at your end.

I don't know specifically why this character loss happens, but I do know these things:

1. The issue applies to multiple Electron-based apps; Skype is an Electron app.

2. The issue is related to how much work JAWS is doing while you type.

3. The loss of characters implies to me that JAWS can lose characters if keyboard events happen faster than
JAWS can process them. Although the newer but not default ""unified"" keyboard handler may resolve this, I
suspect it would currently create other problems; and I have not tested that theory yet.If this is not  an April fools  joke, are the missing characters  also not showing up on a braille display, also what version  of skype are you using, what version of and build of windows, and what have you done to troubleshoot. If this is an April fools joke, disregard my questions.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Thanks, Doug, I started noticing this problem fairly recently, and it may or may not have coincided with me starting to use your scripts for Skype. I had not used your scripts before, but had used Skype, and hadn't noticed the problem previously. However, Skype also got the update to the 8.82.0.404 version recently, so I was wondering, and am probably going start hunting down, which of them might be the culprit.

Thanks,

MarcoHi Sarah,
 
no, this is definitely not an April fools joke. In fact I didn’t even think about the date when posting.
 
Yes, the missing characters show up on the Braille display and with speech. In fact they even produce misspelling warnings because the characters are missing. Once inserted, the spelling
 error goes away. It’s Skype 8.82.0.404, on Windows 11, currently in Insider Beta.
 
MarcoOh. Ok, try disabling the scripts  for jaws first is what I would do, then try reproducing  the error(s) I call them errors even though they are technically not. Good luck.

that option now. Is there a way to uninstall the scripts without using a

is in All Apps. It does not appear in either Programs and Features, or in

Bill White
billwhite92701@...I'm  surprised it wouldn't have been under a start menu  folder with some
kind of shortcut pointing to the uninstaller file. 
JohnHi, John. You are way too logical for me. That's exactly where it is
located, in the Start menu. For some reason, I was thinking that the
uninstall option for the Skype Scripts was somewhere within the JAWS menus.

Bill White
billwhite92701@...The uninstaller can be placed in programs and features because NSIS
builder supports reg query functions. As for placing an uninstaller
within JAWS menu or in the JAWS utility folder, it will require the
admin rights to work. In the common scripting elements section on Ddug
website states that all installer file do not require administrator
permission. It means that installers are specifically built for
current user.
We can request the author to include the installer in programs and
features list.
BestI would not put the uninstaller in both the Start menu and Programs and Features at the same time, but I would listen if anyone has a compelling reason that I should change from using the Start menu to using Programs and
Features. Installers will continue to run without requiring admin rights in any case; that helps in some professional settings I encounter.

Re: Please remind me,"absolutely!Agreed.

    I only think that you (all) are making a tempest in a teapot.

    Come on, folks. It's not always that
      we'll be treated as we would like or even as we treat other
      people. The show must goes on though.

      Once I was a victim of this ""google before asking"" stuff and just
      read all of it. My life hasn't changed in any way because of it
      and in the end I even laughed because of this very same paradox
      pointed out here that folks could have used their time for
      answering my question instead ofcriticizing me.

      Again, the show must goes on.

    Em 05/05/2019 14:13, cecropia64 disse:I agree, a simple question deserves to be simply answeredso then, what prevented those of you that are now pissing and
      moaning about the issue from answering the question?
    Absolutely friggen nothing! that's what.
    

    
    Instead of lambasting Sarah for her stance, which, quite frankly
      I agree with, by all means, next time, answer someone's question
      and not all cry fowl or unfair when the list moderator makes an
      excellent point!
    

    
    We all have lives outside of the various lists and fora we are
      on, and I've seen most, if not all fo you on other such as well.
      and on some of those other lists, you are indeed encouraged to
      either RTFM, or google it before asking the list. 

    
    

    
    In short, get off your high horses the lot of you, and give Sarah
      a break.Speaking for myself, I didn’t know the answer or I would have.
But then, look at how much time it took to read the messages, and type out  all of the responses?
It probably took Sarah and everybody else longer to type out how people should be googleing , rather than typing a less than 20 second message with two keystrokes.



It took me a lot longer for example to type this message out than it would have to give the simple answer.
that being said, I would have looked  up Microsoft keyboard  shortcuts for Skype before I posted that question on here.
At the same time though, I don’t mind answering a simple question either.
It probably is quicker to ask the question and have somebody respond, rather than open up google and type the  question.
Although, with  knolidge results, the answer would be there pretty quick too.
I can honestly see  both sides.
And NOw i’ve rambled on enough.
Take care,

I believe that one should learn how to google before coming to forums and lists for help. Even look in the message archives which are here for a purpose. I even remember linking to them at  one  time. So be responsible and google and read any manuals if at all possible. We are a group of users but we are not the end all be all. We as he blind and sighted need to learn how to google and do research first before coming to someone for help. I'm shocked at how many of us  cannot and often will not do this. If this person would have taken the time to google (I don't care if they were out) they would have found the answer way faster than asking us. If you email support of any product they do encourage you look for help before and while you waite for an answer. That is a nice way of saying essentially, RTFM. They took the time to write the manuals, Now let's take the time to  learn from them.

That message was actually meant for everyone  including myself. I often google first before asking for help this way I learn  via my own methods. Plus learning to google for stuff is a must. I don't often have the time to ask for help on lists and forums, so googling or asking my google assistant on how to do something for me is key, especially if I'm in the middle of work. Plus at least for me on mac it gives the hint right ther in the window when an incoming call comes in. If it does not for you then there is a bug somewhare.

I don't have a specific recommendation on how to distribute, and I'm actually not sure what methods are

are either using websites or Dropbox or a similar means of sharing.

I do have a Skype group chat for translators and I don't see a German contingent in there. If you want in,

Re: Q&A on Skype 8.51 and my JAWS scripts,"In the Q&A message I posted earlier today, also quoted below, I mentioned that I needed to address the problem of user changes to the Command key landing in the wrong file. I have now done this, and posted revision 130 at
https://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/ for anyone needing this functionality.Doug,

Thank you for your continuous  efforts. I downloaded the scripts 3 times and I keep ending up with  the same 121 revision instead of the 130 revision you mentioned above. Am I missing something?I don't know why you would get vevision 121; the file posted on my site is updated. However, due to my haste at releasing, the recorded revision number in the installer and for Insert+Q for this revison says revision 129
instead of 130. So if you're hearing 129, you still have the right stuff.Thanks Doug for the prompt response. I am sure it says 121. I retried 3 times and I keep getting the same one. Could it be something  on my side?Yes; browser download cache perhaps.Doug, thanks. it is indeed what you said. I used internet explorer instead of google Chrome and finally I got the right one.

Thank you once again!Hey Doug and list, make me add a think in the first answer,
      meaning why we don't see the split view option available. 

    
    According to the tests that I made, and also some friend of mine
      even using Mac, you cannot activate split view if you try to do it
      when a call is ongoing. So if this is the case, hang up the call
      and then try it again.

    Bye!
    BarbuzThings work here exactly as you describe, including the mood text anomaly. I found that one a few weeks ago; and to my surprise, it's actually a Skype bug - which I reported via the Skype Feedback system. The wrong mood text
actually remains in MSAA and is just being announced as it is found.Would you be able to provide a feedback link so those of us who can can upboat said feedback?

Re: Scripts downloaded,"I am concerned that people are actually disabling Windows Defender and possibly other protective software to download my scripts. The following is a bit technical and mostly aimed at getting technical feedback. TL;DR: I
don't recommend disabling protective software, and if something is making you do that, I'd like to know why, including specific message text you're seeing. I classify message types below and give my more specific advice on
how to handle each type.

There are, I'd say, three basic types of messages one can get from modern protective software. From least to most severe:

1. ""It is dangerous to run software downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to do this?"" This is categorically true and has nothing to do with the specific software in question; it is only related to where the
software is coming from. I would say the appropriate way to respond to this sort of message is to bypass the warning without disabling the protective software entirely. The appearance of this type of message indicates a
likely well-guarded computer and says nothing about the software being downloaded. Disabling protective software to get around this sort of message is risky because it unprotects you for no reason. Btw, I also put messages
like, ""This software is not signed,"" in the same category, because it simply is a warning that you need to make sure you trust the software origin. We may come to a day when there is no way to bypass this warning without
disabling protective software; but I don't think we're there yet. I welcome corrections from anyone who knows of a case where this is an insurmountable issue.

2. ""This download looks dangerous."" This is a very broad category, but I mean to include cases where protective software uses what are often called heuristic tests to figure out if a program might do something troublesome
if run. False positives in this area abound and are sometimes rather famous in the IT industry because of the trouble they can cause. However, I treat any such message seriously; and on one occasion, a couple years ago I
think, messages like this from at least three different protective software applications led me to revert to an older version of the Nullsoft Installer System (NSIS) for building my installers, because I came to think that
perhaps the newest version at the time was creating installers that contained something I did not understand. I would say the appropriate response to a message in this category is to do all of the following, in order:

A. Notify me, and/or this list or an appropriate forum for the particular scripting project in question, exactly which protective software is notifying you (Windows Defender, Symantec Endpoint Protection, etc.), and
exactly what the message says. Include any apparent names or techie-looking designations of a threat that is suspected or detected.

B. Hold off downloading the scripts until you get a response from me on whether it is a known issue or instead represents a possible problem. I don't expect any problems of this sort; but as I said, I once had to alter my
NSIS version to fix messages like this.

C. If the issue is determined to be a false positive, I might need help reporting the issue to the vendor of the protective software. That also happened during the NSIS reversion incident.

3. ""This download contains this specific virus, trojan, malware, etc."" I have never seen a report like this on a script installer, though at first the above-mentioned NSIS issue confused me because some of the messages
did include names of threats that turned out to be names of heuristic algorithms rather than names of viruses etc. I know absolutely no way for any malware to get into what I post, and I have protections in place against
it; but I also think I am not absolute in my knowledge or authority over technology. :-) So similar to the previous item, I would really appreciate timely and specific reports of anything of this sort if they ever occur.Hi Dug I am running windows defender and when I try to download your scripts
I am getting the message this softwhere is not normily downloaded and may
harm your computer. I am running windows 10 64 bi and jaws 2018 as well as I
hve jaws 18 on my computer as well. From Mich. Ps when I hit incert q when
running scripts all I hear is google crome is loaded and the aplacation is
skype and that's it. I have not tried un loading jaws and re loading it to
see if that would fix this since you said something about a version number
that is announced if the scripts are working right. From Mich.Effectively on my hand Windows defender is actually complaining, though I didn’t have issues in downloading the scripts, I think it’s because I don’t use Internet Explorer but I passed to Google Chrome. What I get though is a warning from Smart Screen as soon as I try to launch the executable. If that happens for someone else, do the following:
1. press tab till you find “further information” link, and activate it, but be careful because since some tests I run you need to use spacebar and not enter, even if it’s  recognized as a link;
2. use tab again till you find “run anyway” button, and press space to activate it.
Now you authorized to run this file and you’ll get the main installer page; you will get a warning if you want to uninstall older scripts if you already have them, this is normal and harmless.
Bye!
BarbuzThat message is in my first category; it shows up when the download is not known by sites that rate downloads by perceived safety. Simply put, it was a new script release; so it was not ""commonly downloaded"" yet. :-)

And you probably do need to restart JAWS to get the scripts to load. That's a JAWS bug I should report, if I haven't already; it's been around for quite a while by now.Hi again Dug I did un load and re load jaws and when I hit incert q all jaws says is google crome settings are loaded the application that is running is skype then it spells it out but I hear no number or anything. Also it says I have 1 un red message but I hve no un red messages so I am not shure if that is a bug or not. Hth. From Mich.Hi, Doug. Often using speech with Microsoft Edge and Firefox, trying to find
the Download Anyway button and bypass the warning is almost impossible. The
only recourse we sometimes have is to disable the protective software. My
antivirus will alert me most of the time if there is a real threat, and I
don't want layers of warnings that I have to consistently defeat.

Bill White
billwhite92701@...Thanks billions Doug.
I enabled Windows Defender immediately after the download was completed.Hi Mich,
    now that I figure out you're running such old versions of JAWS,
      such as 18 and 2018, right?
    I think you also need to install scripts load manager then, which
      is necessary to make Skype scripts load properly under JAWS
      version below than the august 2019 update for JFW 2019. Here it's
      the direct link for this package:
      http://www.dlee.org/slman/jfw_slman.exe
    For the 1 number that you hear, if you don't find any chat
      message try to focus the notification panel, hotkey should be
      ctrl+i if I am not wrong.
    Bye!

Re: Shortcut for the back button doesn't work,"You're right, the back button doesn't seem to exist in 8.58! I haven't experienced any problems getting alt 1 to work lately though.I am told that the Back button is no longer present in Skype for Windows Desktop as of at least Skype 8.58 if not 8.57. Léonie, do you still encounter difficulties with this? I was starting to implement a shortcut when I
realized I could not produce the button anymore myself.Léonie, I failed to answer this over month-old message; but typically, unanswered emails sit in my inbox until I do; and that happened here. I am slating for implementation in the Skype Electron scripts a faster way to click
the Back button, though I could not reproduce your specific issue myself. I'd be curious to know if this still happens to you. Sorry it took me so long to answer.hi doug

ctrl1 doesn't work as a back keystroke  for me either. I also have to
tab round to the back button.

I'm running exactly the same as leonie.It does still happen, but a bit of experimentation has found that maximising the window seems to solve the problem - although the default/original size of the window is perfectly normal according to sighted people I've checked with.I'm sure the window maximizing thing means that window size can govern what's included in a window in Skype Desktop. Good to know; thanks for the quick reply.

And for all else watching, keep in mind that there was a typo in the message I was answering: Alt+numbers jump to parts of Skype, not Ctrl+numbers.that doesn't work for me either, and i'm sure it isn't active in this version.I'm sorry, that might be something new to me...
    Anyway, with Skype 8.x (not only 8.55), alt+1 should focus the
      conversations list, alt+2 the contact list. I never heared
      anything that you could do with ctrl+1 in Skype 8.

    Going back to the original topic, I activated the notification for
    sign ins, and:

    
      I can confirm that it works on my Windows machine even if I
        use NVDA under Windows 10, so no SkypeWatch needed since my
        screen reader reports it perfectly;
      I switched on my Macbook for other reasons so I took advantage
        of that, and when I wanted to check this option there as well I
        figured out it was already checked.

Just tab to where it says More Options button, click on that.

Scroll down and you should see where it says Enable Split screen, and click on that.Hello guys, as I mentioned on the other day, a friend of mine
      still did not see it, I don't know if today he does though. I
      think they're gradually rolling out this feature.
    Bye!
    BarbuzWhen I contacted to Skype support, they said to me that the developers has removed split view for improving it.
As far as myself is concern, I’m using Skype 8.51.0.86 and I have split view.

+1-631-5335683I have that also.
    I'd recommend waiting for any improvements.
    Meanwhile, it works for me so far.I was looking at the options with that version of Skype.
    I found one that said Skype in compact view swiched

    
     off.
    For me, I don't get multiple
      conversations anyway, so it's not a priority.
    It's just one of those things I'll
      figure out when I need it.
    Just my opinion based on experince,
      nothing more.On 2019-08-21 2:48 p.m., Marius Swart wrote:I will want to look at supporting split-view mode; but as it is in an Insider version only, I currently don't have it to test.

To address a remark in a related email: ""Compact List mode"" is something else and has been around for quite a while.Doug, split view mode is available in the Skype update I downloaded just a
few hours ago.  The version I'm running is 8.51.0.6.  The update downloaded
as soon as I opened Skype this evening my time.Yep.

Just found it a few minutes ago, right in More Options; Enable Split View.

Curiosity kicked in, and there it was.I have split view enabled but The sounds for receiving a message has gone away. The option for the sound is checked in notifications.


GaryAha! I had not looked in the right place since upgrading, largely because I was told the feature was not in my build lol. In any case, just one scant minute ago, I got Split View activated over here. Got a manager meeting and
one or two other concerns on my plate yet today; but barring problems and given energy, this is on top of my list to check out now.

My version, though, is 8.51.0.86. I only now realized that the below-mentioned 8.51.0.6 was probably not a different version but just a missing 8. :-)I disabled

 it again, in case the chat sounds are gone.
I guess I could have left it on just to see if it still works.On 2019-08-21 4:39 p.m., Doug Lee wrote:Does Insert+Q in a chat window say Revision... or Chrome?Mine says Revision 113.Hi guys, I figured out on my hand the split view is now
      available, though it wasn't untill last monday. I tested it and I
      figured out that the scripts aren't recognized inside a chat, I
      have revision 121 but ins+q says Google chrome settings are loaded
      when pressed inside a chat. Disabled immediately.
    Bye!
    BarbuzI found the scripts worked as usual in split mode, and ins-q said
      the script revision.
    I just disabled it in case the sounds don't work.
    I'm sure this will all be figured out in time.Thanks Jerry for your report, I don't know why it happens that
      problem on my hand, possibly because of JAWS not fully updated but
      this is just my supposing.
    A friend of mine said that he doesn't have this mode yet, he's
      using NVDA as his primary screen reader but I don't think this can
      have anything to do. My theory is, split view is gradually rolling
      out for users, like some Whatsapp features such as calls.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10I removed the Dropbox folders for translation work when I switched to the XML approach for localization. I am using the Desktop version rather than the Store version now so I will get updates sooner, but I don't install
updates except via Skype itself or via the official website. I actually prefer to use ""Check for Updates"" in Skype itself because I figure an update is most likely stable when it can be found there.Ok, I see. So we need to wait... Smile.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10I have not seen an update to Skype 8.69 yet. I have seen a similar issue twice, both times when there was a call involved; so I think the issue I saw is not actually the same. I am still running Skype 8.68.Allright, thanks for telling me. I actually saw the update through ninite.com and manually updated as always. Remember though that I use the one for Windows desktop, not from Micorosft store.

"Re: Skype 8.77.97, problems in viewing conversations list","Bomb news, I fixed it on my macihne!

Once you are on Skype main window, route JAWS to pc and go down with arrows in the chat list untill you find something like, free download. Here you just route pc to jaws, and the problem is gone away!

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10But I’m not facing any kind of problem using the same version of Skype.Can you give me more detail? Sent from Mail for WindowsLikewise for me.
    I allowed the update yesterday, and Skype functions normally.My friend, make sure you have build 97, not 90. Anyway I already sent how I fixed on my machine.

If none of you have this problem here, chances are it's only affecting the Italian version of Skype.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10I went to the conversations list, routed Jaws to PC, went to the bottom of the list and routed PC to Jaws.  I can read the conversation list just fine!

AlanI found it hard to find my contacts, and I kind of had to set things to what I was used to. Why on earth don't they just leave things alone? Oh well.Hi Alan, yeah I went down with arrows but it's possibly the latest item in the window. If you managed to do it going in the bottom of that screen, it's ok.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10I am sad to say it has not worked for me.

I've been able to just find the new chats that have come in through
the notification center, when pressing Windows A. If I tab twice and
use the arrows down, I can then see all new chats or calls on Skype.Correcting, help menu (or question mark menu) and then report a problem.

Finally, to become a patron and help support the podcast go hereDear Michelle & List:I believe the message is hard coded for good reason. Have not asked British subjects if Skype can be used to call 999 in the UK and Ulster or 112, 113 or 114, the numbers for Police, Fire or Ambulance in the rest of the world without influence from the UK, USA etc. When setting up cell towers, there is an option to have them accept calls to 112 as well as 911. For several years, Siri knew 112 but not 911. My friend in NYC said no idea who 112 will connect you to. I said if the phone rings foreign style, tell whoever you have reached what you want, where and if they ask if you are in New York, Yorkshire, say no, the one with Kennedy International airport! Give them a minute to call your 911 or type the message on their TELEX and expect to hear the reassuring sound of responding sirens responding from 30-blocks away in a minute or two. Cops give misdirected reports from other police officers priority response.Not sure if European/Asian/Australian cell towers accept calls to 911.Brian K. LingardSkype isn't for emergency calling anywhere.

I sincerely do not use Skype credit since much time, it’s been even disabled in my account. I think though that you’ need to specify the country somehow, so if there is not another way such as a combo box for selecting it, you’ll probably have to insert the country code manually.

Actually though, I try the manual update now and then but hadn't yet. I am now running 8.58 because the manual update worked for me, though the Update button is not labeled and, in my haste, I did not try to fix that.

From time to time, updates have come out on the website that don't become available via the in-app Update button. Those, admittedly, I have a history of ignoring until they are made available inside the app itself.

"Re: Skype issues that I see, response to several messages on this list today","You are kind. :-)

Realistically though, the world started going from mostly Skype to a diverse set of alternatives years ago. The virus only served to make more urgent the need for us to keep up with all of those alternatives. Also, NVDA has
become popular enough that scripting for JAWS is no longer enough to fill the needs of everyone. The significant increase in choices does indeed complicate my life, but so it goes in general. In short, the telecommunication
landscape and the screen reader landscape are both going the way of the Roman empire; so no one, no solution, and no script will anymore enjoy Caesar status. :-)

As it happens, I have resumed work on Skype UWP scripts even though I expect Skype UWP to change completely in very short order. The reason is the arrival of this Meet Now service by Microsoft, whereby one can build a
permanent call/meeting that is open to all, even to those with no Skype and with Skype but no Skype account. Clicking a shared Meet Now link seems to open Skype UWP on most Windows 10 machines. I saw information about this a
day or two ago and resumed Skype UWP work last night. I don't have an ETA for a script update yet though.I'm not letting go of skype, it's part of my  job, at least for now. We also are trying to find other means though so we'll see.. And now that apple working actively to stop electron apps from being on our systems, it's imperative that those of us doing our jobs on mac must find a solution.

Finally, to become a patron and help support the podcast go hereWhy would Apple be trying to keep Electron apps off your system? Asking you and probably another contact as well; this is news to me.Hi Sarah,
 
Skype won't go away, but as I said in past, it 
became less and less accessible for the blind, and this especially under 
Windows.
We can use it, but if it becames too bad and too hard or impossible 
to be scripted, it is a good idea to talk about this with the hope that somebody 
might know about another solution which is more friendly for us. The talk is a 
positive one, not a negative one.

Finally, to become a patron and help support the podcast go hereHi Doug,

Re ""meet now service"":

Not needing to have software on your machine to be able to join in is
also a very popular trend and is probably one of the main driving forces
for Zoom's growing popularity.


These services offering 24/7 open communications I guess are the 
modern evolution of the old 24/7 telephone conference lines that people
used years ago to build MLM businesses. 


I just wish that these international mega billions companies could find
it in their hearts to dedicate a small fraction of their gross revenue to
orphan tech like accessibility for the blind.  Even if they didn't
want to do the actual work then at least they could underwrite people
like yourself who are willing to take on the task.


Just my thoughts of appreciation for how far we have come in my 70 plus
years but still aware of how far we still have to go.


All stay well,

Mike in SCEven worse then those things is that the hotkey Control+Insert+Y to move to the list of chat messages is not working anymore, sometimes after opening Skype nothing happends when pressing Shift+Tab or Tab for moving there, and this for several minutes, also sometimes Skype appears as locked for several minutes when pressing Alt+1, so if somebody sends me a message, I am not able to read that message immediately until Skype starts working well.
This happends when using latest Skype with your scripts under Windows 7. Under Windows 10 there are many more other bad things that appear in many other applications, so passing to Windows 10 is not a solution.
You tested more text and voice chatting apps. Do you know if there is one that's better accessible for the blind and easier to use than Skype?

--OctavianI can confirm that Skype can be slow to switch chats. I'm pretty sure that happens regardless of whether you run scripts, or even JAWS; but someone please prove me wrong if possible.

The hotkey for moving to message history is also not working as well as it once did, but I may be able to fix that one. I noticed it earlier this weekend but did not include it in my message because I wanted to test it
further before commenting on it.

As for Skype alternatives, here's a somewhat complete list of what I've worked with lately, in no particular order. This list includes of course only the clients and platforms I've seen and/or scripted in a non-professional
setting; i.e., I've scripted other clients under contract and am not listing those here.

I have scripts for Unigram, the Windows 10 Telegram client that is most accessible. The app comes from the Windows Store; the scripts come from https://www.dlee.org/unigram/

In fact, my use of Unigram includes hosting my project update announcement channel there, along with a paired discussion group for the things I release. See my contact page for current details: https://www.dlee.org/contact/

A while ago, I did a bit of Discord scripting for a couple of folks; but those are surely pretty out of date by now. I'm told that Discord text chatting is still pretty accessible though.

I have fairly comprehensive scripts for Slack at https://www.dlee.org/slack/ and some very soon to be significantly updated scripts for Microsoft Teams, which will replace Skype For Business (SFB), at
https://www.dlee.org/teams/

Both of those are more for the professional arena I think, but I think they can be used outside of that environment.
I am not listing my SFB scripts here, though I have three different sets of those for different SFB versions, because as I said, Teams will be replacing SFB. Also, SFB is exclusively for professional settings as far as I know.

Of course there's also Zoom, which is probably the most popular of the platforms now for voice. It also supports text chatting, and scripts for that one are included in JAWS 2020 and also are available from Bryan Hartgen.

Then we have TeamTalk and TeamSpeak, which I scripted as well: https://www.dlee.org/teamtalk/ and https://www.dlee.org/teamspeak/

Those are also more known for voice but do support texting. TeamSpeak will at some point move to a new structure that has global text chat support much like Discord, but the date for that has remained uncertain for quite some
months by now.

And I guess I will complete my list with that old but amazingly still kickin' client known as Zello. I still have scripts for that one at https://www.dlee.org/zello/ though I rarely work on that one because I long ago got
tired of wrestling with bugs in the Windows client. Still, the platform survives and gets used, especially in emergency settings from all I hear, though again, more for voice than for text I think.i confirm the  slowness/sluggishness. however, the hotkeys for both moving to the history and edit field are both still working for me as of this e-mail.

I am using Skype Version 8.58.0.98 and script revision 137Hi there,

concerning Skype  chat I use scripts revision 137, so I use scripts command, meaning command key followed by h for going into the history tab. I did not test other commands myself, the ones mentioned on some previous messages, such as ctrl+shift+y, may come from Freedom scientific.

Another correction on point 5 of Doug original post of this thread. I noticed the strange behaviour of focus going back to one star very fast after I go out of this, but it happens after regular Skype calls, not Skype to phone ones; I don't make Skype to phone calls since a very large amount of time and my credit is now disabled.

Bye!

Let me address some claims I've seen, today on this list and elsewhere over time, about Skype for Windows, and some of my own claims besides:
Claim 1: Skype online status is sometimes wrong.
True. In the past few weeks, I've seen a Skype status of ""Last seen days ago"" for contacts I saw less than six days earlier. To my initial alarm, that message has for some time been widely recognized as meaning that you are
blocked by the contact. I find this no longer to be the case; I've seen friends and professional colleagues alike display as ""Last seen days ago"" without having blocked me.I can confirm this. I have a colleague who I message every day, and whose status frequently says he hasn't been seen for days even when we're in the middle of a chat. He uses a Mac, but whether that's relevant or not I don't know.

[...]

Claim 3: ""File sent"" no longer speaks after a file transfer.
Not sure about this one. I do know that ""File sent"" finally stopped speaking after the sending of a chat message, but I don't send files much. I also know that both of those messages are not likely to speak if you split your
chat windows out from the main Skype window, because of the way the Skype notifications work.When I choose a file for sending Jaws says ""1 file selected"", when I hit enter to send it, Jaws says ""File sent"". I send a lot of files using Skype and this is consistent behaviour. I don't use split windows.

Claim 5: Focus sticks to the ""1 star"" button after a Skype-to-phone call.
Uncertain but reliably reported. If anyone else has seen this one, please let me know. I have not seen this one on my machine, and I make a fair number of Skype-to-phone calls; but I may have just jumped past it too fast.
I do too, but I usually dismiss the request for ratings. I'll pay more attention next time and post here if I find out anything useful.
-- 
@LeonieWatson Carpe diem.I do find switching between chats is very slow. It can take around 5 to 10 seconds sometimes, and I frequently find I have to hit the button for the intended chat more than once before it does it at all.

When a chat is loaded the shortcuts for moving between the history and the message field work fine though. I use the Jaws key, control and e or y shortcuts.Hi Doug,

Thank you for the list of Skype alternatives. I tested some of them, and I will test TeamTalk, TeamSpeak and Zello, because the ones I tried are not at least as good as the old Skype for Desktop.

--OctavianThank you. I tried this method but it just makes a short beep and a little longer one without moving the focus to the list of chats. Probably you are using Windows 10.

--OctavianGood day All,

Just to way-in on this topic; I am also finding the need to explore other
software like Team Talk, Zoom, and others 


I feel badly for Doug Lee, who has now for several years tried against
all odds to make Skype work for us like it once did, only to keep having
to fix something that keeps getting more difficult to keep up with
because of Skype's constant changes and quirks. .


Just like we all had to let go of Skype 7.xx versions I guess we should
maybe get ready to some day do the same with Skype in general and be open
to finding software that is more naturally accessible to the blind
community.


I say these things not out of anger but rather out of an honest feeling
of guilt that we keep needing so much of Doug's time spent just trying to
not get too far behind with all the work he needs to do and re-do just to
keep Skype almost working day to day.


Many heart felt thanks to you Doug for all you do for us.


Stay well all,

Mike in SCHey Octavian, yes I am running Windows 10. If you're still using 7, my advice woud be to verify if you can upgrade your machine, since this OS is now out of support so you won't receive all security updates.

Re: Skype phone number,"Most likely your number will be gone after some period of time. 
I use Google Voice and if I don't use it after a certain amount of time they will retire it and give it to someone else (yes they do email you.)
Skype would email you too about this. 
But to keep it  active, best thing is to pay when its time to do so.
JohnIf you have an auto-renewal set up, you will be charged for the next period automatically and your number will
remain active. If you don't have an auto-renewal set up, your number will expire.Thanks. I did not have enough funding for the Skype phone numberHi Josephine,
Incase you don't renew your skype subscription, then after a certain period of time, the number gets resigned to someone else.

"Re: Skype saying ""file sent""","Yeah I'm getting that same message as well. Its weird.The ""File sent"" issue has been reported to Microsoft, by me and surely several others. It is a bug in Skype itself and occurs with or without scripts, and probably also in NVDA though I did not verify this. It will need to be
fixed by Microsoft. I do confirm, unfortunately, that Skype 8.54 does not fix it.It's a bug, I'm sure they are aware of it. I get this on mac os. Have for about 3 months now.

Take care

    -- 
Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10That makes sense; in split view, these announcements, even the right ones, are not likely to happen as Skype is currently written.Thanks for confirming. I'll report it too in that case.

Léonie.I've had this happening too.

But, it didn't affect functionality, so, forf me, it's no big deal.Hello Léonie,
I  do have the same problem and reported it on Twitter to the official
Skype  account.  They  said  like ""Go to Microsoft Disability Desk"". I
haven't done it yet, but I don't think that will help somehow. this is
not  a  screen  reader message, this comes straightly from Skype's UIA
(or ARIA if they use it in Electron).

Twitter (English only): @AndrePolykanineI can verify that. If I look  in the accessibility messages  that they have for mac os, it does say""file sent""  and not ""message sent"" when it should.

Re: Skype sounds,"Hi guys, I sincerely need to test it more deeply because I don’t remember it well but I think they’re working ok on my Windows machine. Anyway, if you’re using version 8.71 that they recently pulled out, there is a sort of hotfix, so if your number ends with 36, try to download the installer from Skype’s website and you’ll get version ending with 49. Chances are they realized some bugs including this one.

Thanks, but that's the one I've got.  Strange.Allright Jerry, I am on a conference with some people from Italy, a girl from Puerto Rico sent me a chat and sound worked perfectly. So yes, I am afraid you need to reinstall Skype; if you have the chance, in order to uninstall Skype use some utilities like Revo Uninstaller or Uninstaller by Puran which also remove files and registry keys from the app.

A friend of mine was having a hard time hearing me last night when I wanted to choose my blue yeti microphone which was on and can only hear me through my USB logitech clear chat headset I made sure that my Blue yeti microphone was selected for Skype but for some reason, while it does work with zoom, it’s not playing very well with Skype right now and I’ve noticed this a couple times any thoughts would be appreciated very much thank you. I’m using windows 10 by the way.Hello KelaI too use a yetti with skype. I don’t use windows 10, but I don’t think the version of windows is the problem.

If so, check out my show every Wednesday night from 7 to 10 pm Eastern on Sonic Radio:www.sonicradio.rocksIt’s just the HP default speakers of course I plugged my Bose speakers in the laptop so the blue yeti microphone is not a headset just to be clear. They’re having a hard time hearing me was that but they can hear me with the clear chat USB logitech headset and yet the sound still comes out of my speakers which are by default Hp Audio, something long I cannot remember. I had already set the microphone to blue yeti. So I don’t know what’s going on. I guess I’m just gonna have to keep testing it all out. And by the way it’s chela it is spelled  C h e l a.Hey Mike it’s Sheila. I just solved my problem. I had to uncheck the mute option so in other words when it says in the settings under audio to unmute on incoming calls, I had to check that box. It's fixed now. Yay! The only thing that missed lead me was the fact that when I did the audio test call with the Skype testing service I was able to hear my voice through the speakers of choice with the microphone of choice just fine I just was unaware of the box that I had to check for amusing myself on incoming calls. Glad I got that solved!Glad you got it working correctly. This new layout of Skype can be really tricky to figure out sometimes.

      available only to Skype Insiders. The latest Skype Insider build
      can be downloaded from here:

    The ""Split Window View"" is available in the ""More Options"" menu,

LéonieHello guys, thanks for your responses. I did not have the chance
      to test it yet even if I am now at home, I'll do it later today or
      in the next days.
    Anyway, for those who still have problems in updating Skype to
      8.51, a friend of mine sent me an installer which I don't know
      where he found, but I created a link on Firefox send in case
      someone needs it. Just a pair of notes before the link:
    
      you aren't forced to use Firefox to download this file, but
        you have to use a sufficiently updated browser. For example,
        according to my tests, Internet Explorer will not work with this
        server, even version 11;
      I configured both combo boxes at the highest value available,
        meaning 100 downloads or 7 days before the link expires.

    Bye!
    BarbuzI haven't managed to test Skype 8.51 because it is not available in Check for Updates to me, and I don't want to run an Insider build on this laptop in place of the production Skype. I do consider Skype 8 a priority though; so
if I see any problems when Skype 8.51 comes out properly, I will address them.I don't think there are two preview versions, but there are two ""More options"" buttons: one is announced as ""More options button"", the other as ""More options button menu"". It's this last one that you want.

Testing split view mode briefly, I noticed the following things:

* When I hit enter to send a message, Jaws is no longer saying ""Message sent"".
* I hear the typing noise when someone else is typing, but Jaws does not announce new messages as they arrive.

I'm using the latest of Doug's Jaws scripts.

Léonie.The matter of fact is that there are two versions of Skype 8.51.
1.
Skype 8.51.0.72 this version of Skype electron is stable and it doesn’t have split view.
2.
Skype 8.51.76.87 this version of Skype electron is preview and it has split view.
I have tested both of them and in both versions the script is not working!

+1-631-5335683Send your ConfigNames.ini file from the JAWS user folder (not the shared folder). That file is what decides when to load the scripts. There may be entries with ""skypeelectron"" on the right side of the = sign in one or two
sections, namely [ConfigNames] and [Domains].I haven't been folowing this thread so maybe what I am about to post has been covered.
I don't know if the current August update to JAWS n August 13 would solve your problem or not.
Here is what the enhancement says:

Enhancements in JAWS 2019.1907.42 (August 2019)

This update to the August 2019 release addresses a recently discovered issue where JAWS application scripts failed to load in the latest Skype for Desktop update (version 8.51) released the week of August 12, 2019. There are other possible applications where this could have resulted in scripts not loading also such as the Desktop version of Slack.

"Re: To Doug, Skype UWP scripts won't install","Hello Ahmid,
    effectively I went to the Skype UWP scripts page and figured out
      that the latest update has been released in 2017, so chances are
      they're not compatible with JAWS 2019.
    But, if you're using Skype 8 electron instead, use the scripts
      for said version which are more updated and work ok with JAWS
      2019. Here it's the direct download link:
      http://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/jfw_skypeelectron.exe
    Bye!
    BarbuzFirst, yes the scripts are old and no longer equipped to work with the current version of Skype UWP. I recently looked into updating them but determined that this would be a significant job, because the interface appears to
have been basically replaced since I scripted UWP.

That said though, your compile error is not caused by the scripts being old. I'm betting you have a file called uia.jsh in your JAWS user folder. Removing that file is likely to let you install the scripts, and is a good idea
anyway because that file, which is an outdated copy of a file that comes with JAWS, can cause compilation problems for other scripts as well.Michelle. Thank you. I have noticed   that the scripts haven't been updated in a long time, but since I have not noticed any  one mentioning it  here in the list, I thought they still work.

How can I get Skype electron though?

Doug, thank you very much, you  are right as I failed to install the scripts on jaws eighteen as well.

Thank you very much,Here it's the direct link for Skype 8 for Windows desktop:

    BarbuzThank you very much Michelle. Now it's all set. this one is

    Thank you Doug for the Scripts. Your work is much appreciated.

Re: Turn off typing sound in skype 8.xx,"The first tree item should be Skype 8 Settings, under which the first item should be Typing Sounder. If not, check that your Danish and/or English script file set includes skypeelectron.qs and skypeelectron.qsm files. Those
files create those Quick Settings entries. Also make sure that if you type Insert+Q from within Skype 8, the response starts with the word ""Revision."" If not, the scripts are not running. Of course, the word order may differ in
Danish I suppose.There no is settings for skype in the Quick Settings menu at all. Files and command you mentioned here is all working and in correct folder. So scripts is working except the settings in Quck Settings. Where is is the sound files locanted? Then I can just delete them since I'll never need it.

OZ0TE JacobThe scripts use files that came with JAWS, so you can't fix this by deleting them. You'll have to edit skypeelectron.jcf and put, or update, an entry under [NonJCFOptions]:

TypingSounder=0

It sounds like the Danish translation of the scripts has an issue with the qs or qsm files. If you have the same experience in English JAWS though, I' not sure what's going on because no one has reported this problem and I
don't have it here.I'm using the english version of JAWS 18. Don't know if it can berelated to the fact that I'm using danish Windows 10? I both try english and danish in the Skype settings. I remember back in Skype Classic that some parts of the scripts doesn't work if Skype was set to danish. But in this case with Skype 8 it doesn't matter. OK I'll try to edit the file. Thank you.

Re: Typing sounder not working,"I don't immediately see a language-sensitive element in the typing indicator code; but the indicators work here, so I wonder if there is an issue in the translation anyway.

I am using Skype 8. Since yours is newer, that could also be the issue. I stopped using the Desktop, non-store, version because for some reason it stopped showing me some messages in one conversation that showed up correctly
in this one.Thanks Billions.

I just updated the scripts.  Let's see what happens from here.

My mistake to some degree; I forgot to check for updates on the scripts.Ok Doug, you probably have a lower version than mine. I sincerely never used the Windows store version, so I don't know which version there is now in this particular way, nor I know when updates are available from the store.

Re: Updates for Microsoft Lync and Skype For Business (SFB) JAWS scripts,"Ok Doug, I admit I never used Skype for business but I installed

      remembered something that I installed in the automatic updates but
      I did not manage to recall it well. So I opened C:\Program
      files\Microsoft Office\Office15, and found the file Lync.exe.
      Launching this file it appeared Skype for business as the window
      title, and in order to be sure of the correct version, I went to
      ""Show menu button"", then question mark submenu, about Skype for
      business, and figured out that yeah it was Skype for business

    OZ0TE JacobThanks for the help Jacob. :-)

For anyone curious, the reason it's no longer in the same place, is that ""the same place"" isn't the same anymore. :-)

The Insert+V, or JAWSKey+V command, used to bring up the JAWS Verbosity dialog, then the JAWS Options tree, and finally now the Quick Settings dialog. I managed to get the code for changing the Command key to work in the first
two of those, but Quick Settings is quite different and did not seem friendly to that sort of modification.Hi Jacob, I tried it, but I must be doing something wrong.  When I`m in the Skype window and my keyboard is set to Canadian French, I press the command key and then control+c.  It doesn`t seem to bring up that box.  Am I starting from the wrong place? AlanInsert+C not CTRL+C.

      scripts features section:
    ""The JAWS virtual cursor is turned off each time Skype 8 takes
      focus, to simplify navigation. The built-in JAWS Skype 8 scripts
      also do this as of this writing. Use Ins+Z while in Skype if you
      want to turn the virtual cursor on or back off manually.""
    I sincerely never activated virtual cursor from within Skype so I
      don't know for sure the problems in such a case; what I assume
      though is that if the scripts behave like this there must be a
      reason.

My first book on Kindle, (now accessible!), The View From Here, can be found at:
www.amazon.com/dp/B009ESXJAWRegarding the messages you already got on this: I doubt this is related to any screen reader, scripts/add-ons,
or even accessibility. It sounds like more of a Skype technical or permission problem.

A few questions:

Do you use a VPN?

Did you change Internet services recently, replace or reset your router, or change how your computer connects
to it?

I'm not aware of any international diplomatic relations issues that would cause this, but I'll include that
thought in case you know something I don't.

Do you have any other Skype-capable devices you could try?

That's all I can think of for now.I haven't tried a VPN for years! And no, no changes in internet. which
is why it was very surprising.

I also thought of an International sort of an attack on Microsoft
related products in Israel, but so far, nothing has come up in the
news...

I really appreciate everyone's assistance in trying to figure this
out. At least now I know I have a way of contacting Microsoft help
without Skype itself, so I plan to do that as soon as I finish my work
for the day.I agree with Doug, sounds more like a technical/connection issue, not accessibility. I had a problem yesterday where I did not see many contacts and I needed to close Skype and restart it. Don't know if it can have anything to do, but my hotmail account recently gave me an error in Thunderbird which actually fixed it by itself as far as I can tell.

Bye!

Konu: [skypeenglish] Workaround for JAWS 2019 pre August update and Skype
8.51

I finally got Skype 8.51 onto my laptop, which allowed me to work out the
following trick for using my scripts without installing the JAWS 2019 August
update. Note that because the scripts do not load, or at least do not
reliably load under the scenario being worked around, this problem cannot
reasonably be resolved via modifications to the scripts themselves.

If you use Skype 8.51 and my latest Skype scripts are installed but do not
load (i.e., Insert+Q inside Skype says Chrome rather than Skype settings are
loaded):

Edit the ConfigNames.ini file in the JAWS user folder (not the shared
folder). One way to open this folder is to launch Explore My Settings for
JAWS 2019. Pressing Enter on ConfigNames.ini from there should open the file
in Notepad.

If there is no line saying [Domains], add one.

Below the [Domains] line, add this:

Index=skypeelectron

Save the file and restart JAWS.

Warning: Doing this may adversely impact the operation of other
Electron-based apps you may use. You can always remove the addition(s) and
restart JAWS again to retrace your steps.

Also, it should go without saying (though I'm saying it anyway) that
mis-editing this file could cause other things to stop working as expected.

I am not certain that this workaround will work in all cases. It should not
be required past the JAWS 2019 August update though.

-- 
Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Ok, try this.


don't select anything in the desktop then right click and empty area or hit shift f10.
click create new,
click shortcut.
browse to where everything  is.


follow the prompts afterwords.

If you don't find skype in the start menu, hit shift f10 and click create shortcut, then say yes  to the prompt, it will create the desktop shortcut for you. Works for me every single time I have to do this.That would be a good alternative, if only I knew the current location for Skype for Windows 10...

I personally use Skype for Windows desktop, so I don't have this problem since the desktop icon is already there. We could also uninstall this Skype and install the Windows desktop one, but we recently need to change Skype account so we're afraid it can lose the login data.

-- 
Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10hi michelle

assuming skype is downloaded and in the list of programmes under the
windows key, here is one way of adding a shortcut to the desktop.

1. press windows key and arrow down once to come out of the search
box. first letter navigation doesn't work so arrow down to skype
folder collapsed and hit spacebar.
2. arrow once to skype and open context menu with shift f10.
3.  arrow down to more and then to file location and open this.
4 wait a second and jaws will say skype checked, then open the context
menu again and press s.
5. jaws will say: windows can't create a shortcut here. do you want
the shortcut to be placed on the desktop instead?

steveWow, that is so useful Steve! Thanks a lot, I'll try it but I think I'll do next week.

Re: an unusual question,"Skype can handle stereo as they are using ipus. But no this cannot be done. They do not want to have stereo audio. You can do things on the regular server  but maybe just let people know it's a test.

Good luck.

Re: calling sequence,"Hi steve Useful tips from Mr Lee’s website. A fast way to start a new conversation: Type Ctrl+Shift+s to focus the ""Search Skype"" box. Type the name or partial name of your intended contact, then Tab several times to reach the search results. Use Up and Down arrows to find your intended contact. If at first you do not find the contact, go through the results again as the list may be updated over time as more matches are found. Press Enter to open a conversation and focus the input edit box. If focus does not land in the input box, use the scripted Command e sequence to move focus there. To call the contact immediately once the conversation is displayed, type Ctrl+Shift+P for a voice call or Ctrl+Shift+K for a video call. In regards question 2. There are several options.You can locate joe in your contacts and tab to his profile and find his mobile number in there.Having found joe in your list of chats press the applications key and arrow down to profile.If you have called his mobile at any time, if you arrow down your list of chats, his number will appear there and you simply follow the above steps for making a video or audio call. Below are two links; the first is  to doug’s  website and the second to Microsoft’s “what are hot keys and how do I use them in skype” page. http://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/skypeelectron.htm   https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12025/what-are-keyboard-shortcuts-and-how-do-i-use-them-in-skype",,,,,1,265,87.31,72.6,63.35,30.51,33.13,13.96,76.98,58.49,46.79,6.42,6.04,0.38,0,3.77,1.51,0.38,0.38,14.72,7.92,2.64,13.58,5.66,3.4,6.79,0.75,12.45,4.15,3.77,1.13,0.75,0,0.38,11.7,0,11.7,3.02,3.4,0.38,4.15,0.38,3.77,0,2.26,1.51,0.75,0.75,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,12.83,6.42,0.38,1.13,0,0.38,4.53,6.79,0,0,0,1.89,2.64,0,0,2.64,1.13,0,0,1.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.04,15.09,2.26,2.26,8.68,0.75,0.38,0.38,3.77,1.13,3.02,0.75,1.51,1.51,0.38,0,0,22.64,7.17,2.26,0,0,1.13,12.08

Have you tried reinstalling skype and its scripts or what ever you are using

I see  delete contact.

in New Zealand.

billwhite92701@...Don't know if they have this in New Zealand or not.
JohnI don't think they do. I would try a complete reinstall of skype to see if
that fixes the issue. I just had someone try it on their windows machine and
thney see the 4 options that should be there.Actually I can, but I have to go through be my eyes to do it. They're
excellent though because Microsoft is open 24 seven. It is Microsoft though.Yep I will.I'm wondering if the person has an english issue because the way the sentence was put.Hey Kimmi,
It could be the wrong version of Skype you have. :-)
If you'd like some private help Europe time I'll be willing to help you out
either using jaws tandem or NVDA remote.

I suggest trying the Microsoft Disability Answer Desk: 1-800-936-5900Hi, Kimmie. You did verify that you have Skype version 8.78? I am using Compact View, not Split View. Also, I have a delete contact, but the way I get to the contacts is to use CONTROL plus SHIFT plus S, which brings up the Search Skype dialog. Once there, I select the People tab, tab a couple of times, and the people in my contacts or prospective contacts are there. If I don't have a Delete Contact menu item in the context menu, then I have an Add Contact item.

Try to press the applications key or shift+f10 from within the contact in your contact list in order to open the context menu, latest option should be delete contact. Beware though that in many older Skype 8 versions there was not this possibility, so make sure you updated Skype.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Yes I am on the latest skype I think, and when I press the application key it says profile and remove from favorites and view profile. Nothing with delete anything, and if I try to delete a contact when I'm in the contact view it won't move out.Ah, I actually never used favorites, I'll have to verify if you have to remove the contact from favorites prior to deleting it.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Hi,

I think the only way to do it is to go into the person's profile.  Although
there's a way to simply delete contacts, I've found that the best way is to
actually click on the ""block contact"" button.

AlanYou don't, at least on mac os. I just went to contacts, right clicked on the contact, clicked the delete option then confirmed. Are you updated to the latest skype? I am aware you said yes, but just be double sure.but why he wants to delet the contact?

Às 15:25 de 06/11/2021, Alan Conway escreveu:There are any number of reasons why someone might want to  delete someone on Skype.
Maybe the person doesn't use Skype anymore.
Maybe they don't get along.
Maybe they added the person, but then realized later on that the person is Spam.
Maybe the person died.
Frankly, its nun of our business why.
Johnwell as John said that's not your business.Thanks Sarah I thought I had the latest. What's the keystroke to find out please? thanks.Wow I'll try them all to see which one is going to do the job.lol. thanks
Alan.TO find out what version you are running, If you are using jaws, go to the skype Window, and hit JawsKEY+Ctrl+V.
Another way is in the skype Window, Press Alt+H for help, then down arrow to about and press enter.
You'll see what version you are running in that dialog.
JohnHi John. What's the latest version please? Somehow I have an awful feeling I'm not up to date.Latest Skype version for Windows desktop is 8.78.0.159. Not sure if it has been updated for Microsoft Store, if you still have 8.77 and you used the Store app, try to open the Windows store, go to the view more menu, and choose downloads and updates, and finally find recover updates and you press space and verify if it's get updated. Alternatively, pass to the Windows desktop one going here: www.skype.com/go/getskype-full

My students just have their names, not if they have ben active. One is on DND but still picks up as if he heard  the call. Others say ""active recently."" but they are online now. Yeah, confusing.

I just tried control-shift-h.  It works.Hi all, I am now out of home once again untill saturday, september 19, 2020. I figured out though that they apparently released two builds of Skype 8.64 in a short period of time, but it’s since 10 days I am no longer using Skype for Windows.

Re: inability to use the alt key at first when launching skype,"I think Dough fixed that.

Download the latest scripts here.


https://www.dlee.org/skype/Hi Kimmie,

I recently reported it to the list, I think that Skype 8.69 broke the fix that Doug already made for this in the past. For the time beeing, when you hear this message press windows+up arrow, or if the window is already maximized, press before windows+down and then windows+up. I hope that there will be a new fix soon.

Now that we're on topic, since you're using JAWS 2019, if it's lower than the august 2019 update, you should also install the scripts load manager which you can find at www.dlee.org/slman

"Re: installed scripts, but nothing works","it happened to me a few times and i resolved it by  killing skype
      from the task manager then i restart skype again and usually after
      one or 2 trials it works.The only thing I've seen that sounds similar to what you two describe is this:

Now and then, when I start Skype, it will for a while seem like an empty interface. If I probe at it too much, it may even freeze JAWS for a while. This happens while Skype is collecting its data, syncing, etc., I think.
Since I have a fairly large contact list, there can be some considerable activity for Skype to complete for this. When it's done though, I get the normal interface, Tab works, etc.

If Skype starts when you start your computer, chances are that Windows itself, and maybe a number of other apps, simultaneously do this sort of massive update routine. Put together, that can cause quite a period of sluggish
computer behavior.

I'm not sure if this is what you two are seeing, but if it goes away by itself after a while, I'd say it's likely. ""A while,"" though, may be a minute or a bit more sometimes. Usually, on my current laptop, I don't see
anything that long.

Btw, I also see this sort of sluggishness in other Electron-based apps besides Skype 8, notably Microsoft Teams and Slack. Again though, I don't see it all the time; just now and then, usually after I have left the app
unattended for a while.It happends for me also, exactly as you described.

In order to solve it, to know how much I need to wait until Skype is working again, I use to press Alt+1, then move the focus to other applications and work in them for a while, and then return to Skype after a minute or so and check its status. If Skype is working, the focus should be on a contact in the contacts list, and I just need to press Enter on it, then tab to move from there, then Shift+tab to move back to that contact, and press Enter a second time. After this, Skype is working and the focus usually goes to the message text field and I need to press Shift+tab twice to move to the list of chat messages.

Skype is always working bad after I restart my laptop, but I use to restart my laptop only once in a few weeks. It is also working bad after I leave it unused for a longer time period in a day, so this way of using it is normal for the new Skype made by Microsoft.

--OctavianThis description sounds extensively similar to what I've experienced for however long after rebooting, nice explanation.

I've never timed it, so I truly haven't any ideas to how much time this takes, but somewhere around a minute or so sounds reasonable.Hello Doug and others who has responded,
There is no sluggishness or freezing.
The program comes up as usual and asks for the pass word etc. Once log in is accomplished, the skype window is quickly available.
At that point, nothing works. Skypes acts just as I have described it.
I have left Skype open for 2 or 3 hours and sometimes longer, but Skype just sits there totally unusable.
I have restarted the computer, but this had no effect.
I've thought of re-installing Skype and setting up another account to see if this would solve the problem.
Question though, would I have to re-install the scripts as well?
Also, Can someone provide a link for a clean download of Skype?Hi Sand,

scripts are installed in JAWS folders, not in Skype ones; therefore, you should not need to install them again (unless you uninstalled them of course).

For the Skype installer, try going here: http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-full

You should download version 8.58, which is the latest one nowadays.

Re: just installed 8.5,"Hi Sugar, I think latest version of Skype is 8.64...

Anyway, in order to see all your contacts, you should press shift+tab from the contact list, when you hear ""filter menu"" press space on it, and in the context menu choose ""Show all my contacts"". It tells you inactive, you press enter to check it. I sincerely don't like this approach though, because with Skype 8.x if all your contacts are active the contacts are sorted in alphabetical order, so I decided to see only visible contacts and I prefer it that way. I can't see away and dnd ones though, but well I'm getting used to it.

I think I just figured out something, and it might help a bit to understand the unwanted calls problem.

If memory serves, I think it was Steve:  there's a Skype number involved, much like a phone number complete with your area code.

Sounds like scammers somehow got that number, hence the calls; offers to do duct work, a fake problem with the IRS, or the CRA here in Canada.

If I'm right, the hang up command is your friend.

Then you choose your operating system, I assume in your case it's Skype for Windows desktop and Windows 10.

Re: maybe someone on this list knows,"You might need to find the mute/unmute button with the tab.Hi,
If you have multiple sound cards, your settings in zoom may be pointing to the wrong sound card.
This has happened many times to me, especially after a windows update when the sound cards get switched back to defaults, by windows and I am left with no speech.
Also double check all mute buttons especially after windows updates.
If you only have one sound card, then you can probably delete my message.

Re: message notification sound problem resolved,"Michele,


I found it. I used windows key + i to search settings. searched for notifications and entered on:

Notifications & actions settings


The following option was unchecked and checking it cured it.


Get notifications from apps and other senders _x001D_Button_x001E_
OnWow, I did not know about this setting! I think that can be useful to someone else, also because since it's a system setting that can also affect other applications.

For those who need to change this, I verified it myself and I wasn't able to find a notifications cathegory or something like that; what I did was to type notifications in the search edit box.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Hi Michelle,


didn't get it from the skype sight. It just automatically installed when skype started.


GaryI'm using nvda, but can you reload the scripts in jaws?  I remember you used to be able to do so. If you can, try that in skype for its scripts. I have never had the typer sound continue when I'm not in a chat before.Would split view cause the type sound to be repeated, if I understand the issue? If not, please correct me.This update came out yesterday as far as I can tell. I fixed the Skype typing issue and another issue or two
last night but don't have documentation updated yet, and so had not put out a release. For emergency update in
the mean time, people can grab the installer as it evolves from https://www.dlee.org/updates/jfw_skype.exeHi guys,

Doug, thanks for that, I downloaded revision 217from the link you gave us. I had once again the issue about Windows Defender smart screen when launching the file, so I needed to press further information link and then Run anyway button.

Sarah, I am actually not sure. I always use split view mode and I had issues also in the past where typing indicators weren't working properly, or should I say weren't working at all, but I don't know if this has to do with the Skype language which is italian or with split view. That is why I asked Gary if he enabled it or not.

The constant typing thing can be fixed in the verbosity dialog. Insert
plus V, then down to Typing and uncheck the checkbox.The Windows Defender issue is common because Windows Defender keeps track of which files are known versus
unknown, and of course a brand new file will not be known right away. Every time I update scripts, even though
I keep using the same file name, the file is considered ""new"" by Defender because it is changed.",,,,,1,444,22.38,1.89,90.13,36.29,16.44,18.02,81.76,62.61,50.9,11.49,6.76,4.73,0.23,1.58,0.23,0,4.73,9.01,5.86,2.03,9.01,10.14,7.21,9.01,3.6,18.69,2.93,1.35,2.48,0.45,0.9,1.13,19.82,1.58,18.24,1.8,2.7,2.48,3.38,0.9,8.56,0.23,2.03,1.58,0.45,0.45,0,0.45,0,0,0,0,6.53,3.6,0.45,0.68,0,0,2.7,2.93,0,0,0,0.45,0.9,0,0.23,0.68,5.41,0,1.58,3.6,0.23,0,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9,0,0.9,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,4.5,7.43,0.23,1.13,3.83,1.8,0.45,0.23,7.88,5.41,5.63,0.68,0.45,0.45,0,0,0,19.37,6.08,4.95,1.35,0.68,2.48,3.83

Is there a way to turn that off permanently?

Mustafa, Skype: ebob824@...I noticed this morning with signing in on my account that didn’t come up but when I signed out to go onto the radio station account it came up that time then at the end of my show when I signed out of the radio station skype I went back into mine here it came again.  Didn’t see that tips and tricks didn’t come up but really don’t see the need for testing audio and or video and I don’t have a webcam hooked up anyway.  I do frequently demonstrate that the skype works by dialing the landline number connected to it for requests. So I know my audio works fine.   Sent from Mail for Windows 10No. It will still  forget yoru settings. So keep singed in and just go invisible.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10This looks very much like a problem I've seen in Teams that was fixed there by now in Teams itself. The basic situation is this: The Skype accessibility information starts showing up in a different window than the one that
gets focus, so JAWS and probably all other screen readers fail to figure out correctly what's going on.

Interestingly enough, the solution is often as simple as maximizing the window, such as with Windows+UpArrow. Sometimes in Teams, it was necessary to minimize first and then maximize; but I'm not seeing that here in Skype
so far. I believe you are finding the min-then-max approach more effective though, based on our Skype chat.Hi Doug and all, first of all thanks for the commands which I did not know. I also saw a thread about chrome legacy window, I have reason to believe that they're somehow related.

Concerning the minimize and maximize Skype, this is probably because I have set the Skype icon on desktop like other ones to be shown maximized by default.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10hi all

apologies if this has been discussed but I don't see it.

not only do I get the chrome legacy repeat message, even though i'm
running IE,skype commands do not work at all until I press the alt
key. all is well then for a while but if I don't use skype for several
minutes I have to press the alt key again.

fiddly but not really a big deal.

steveHi Stephen, thanks for the tip. I'll also test the alt key, I already tested win+arrows and they work ok.

Bye!

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Hi guys, I just tested the alt functionality that Stephen suggested in order to fix the problems with Skype. Basically it works just fine, beware though that you'll open the menu bar, so you should press it once again or esc to close it and go back to the Skype main window.

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10In fact there are 3 solutions of this problem.Alt functionality, Windows up/down errow  and restarting your screen reader whatever screen reader you are using!With regards from Inamuddin with the Skype ID:Charlsdarwin1.                                 Sent from Mail for Windows 10Has anyone  reported this to skype and the screen reader makers  if at all possible. Where is the problem exactly, or is this the case of both?On hearing this morning that Skype 8.64, apparently in beta, also exhibits this issue, I filed the following comment for Microsoft via the ""Report a Problem"" item in the Skype Help menu; and I invite others to remark
similarly from their own Skype instances, so that Microsoft hears a chorus of voices and not just one:

Skype 8.63 and apparently the beta 8.64: After a call and after the Skype window is minimized, focusing it while running a screen reader such as JAWS does not work well. We hear ""Chrome Legacy Window"" and cannot navigate or
read. Tapping Alt twice, or Alt then Esc, or Windows+Down then Windows+Up revives the Skype window for use. See also a similar problem that appeared and was fixed in Teams 1.3 within the last few months. This is a serious
disruption for blind Skype users.Hi Doug, thanks for your effort on making this report. I think I cannot do it right now because I am now on my Macbook now since I am on holiday, my connection is also not very good working right now.

Re: problems with version 8.59,"I'm not seeing Skype 8.59 in the Check for Updates for 8.58 yet, but I know that a few people have grabbed it directly from the Skype website.

Try toggling the restored/maximized state of the window and let me know if that helps. This is a test for an issue seen in Teams; I want to know if it is starting to apply to other Electron apps.I tried what you said Doug and no go. :-(I'm still using Skype 8.5.8.0.98 with revision 137 with no problem.hi doug

thanks for the quick response.

nothing works to maximise/minimize.

however, not sure if chela is getting the same, when I press win b and
tap on notification button, it says skype minus signed out.

if I have the login details incorrect, which is highly unlikely as
I've never changed it, then skype isn't giving any notification at all
that the username or PW is incorrect or giving the option to try
again.

we simply have silence!!This happened to me in the past but I am not sure if it is relevant. Sometimes, toggling the virtual cursor on and off allows you to read text that is hidden in the beginning. Last month I signed out by accident and I struggled to remember my password. there was a message there in the page that asked me to update my e-mail retrieval details. I didn't notice it at first. I had to toggle the virtual cursor a couple of times and also alt tab away and back to Skype before I managed to read it.



HamidI’m logged in successfully however it is still unresponsive. No matter what I do even the virtual cursor and jaws cursor aren’t responsive. It’s like JAWS locked up when starting skype no matter what I do, so I end up bringing up task manager close the app, still no go. :-(Guys I am afraid there are two different problems. I found out a similar issue to what Chela is saying, meaning a sort of memory leak, with a friend using NVDA. BTW, I think I posted here about this issue, but then he told me that it fixed by itself in a couple of days.

About incorrect sign ins instead, I sometimes had these kinds of issues, latest one I think it was yesterday or sunday night. I do my radio program Rock the weekend on a dominican webradio, and so when I am onair saturday and sunday night I sign in to the radio account, and then I'll go again in my personal one after program. Doing this, I sometimes write password incorrectly without realizing, so I cannot see contacts online; when I quit and restart Skype though, I foind the window with a button that says, for instance, ""Sign in as Radio espacial"", like it happened latest time. If I already did program and should go back to my personal account, I then use the ""Sign in with another account"" button and put my login data.

Bye!

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Well I only have one login credential set and it shows that I actually am logged in correctly it’s just not talking to me it says if my screen readers crash therefore I have been now using Skype for iPhone instead if I want to do Skype calls or chats until this gets fixed. And just so you guys know my thing auto updated before I could stop it. Before I was running I think version seven or 8.2 or something It was before 8.5 I know that for sure. And unfortunately I don’t have the executable to reinstall that version.Respected friends,as far as my self is concern I am using the latest version of Skype and I have no problem at all.With regards from inamuddin with the Skype ID:Charlsdarwin1  Sent from Mail for Windows 10Hi all.
    

    
    The latest version of Skype installed after restarting this
      morning.
    I'm still using revision 137 with Jaws 2020.
    So far, all is well.
    

    
    Jerry.hi

sorry, forgot to say earlier, my skype is now working fine after
several restarts and reinstallations.So, let me get this straight, in order for me to get Skype and say JAWS and or NVDA working again with Skype, I have to continually do this uninstall/reinstall process until it works? I have two laptops by HP that I may have to do this process on. Sounds like a hard workaround though.
I do notice that there are two flavors of the JAWS scripts on Doug's site, the one I have is for desktop labeled electron which may be 8.59 I think, and the other peeks my curiosity, think it's the UPW version. Never heard of this one. Is that for the windows 10 app from the app store?Try to use the latest JAWS script as well which is revision 49.With regards from Inamuddin with the Skype ID:Charlsdarwin1  Sent from Mail for Windows 10Yes, Skype UWP is the one for Windows 10 from the Store; there are reports saying it'll go shortly but at the moment there's no clear evidence of this.

Re: renewing Skype subscription,"nothing happens to your actual skype account. your subscription simply
ends if you don't renew it.Dear Joseph & List:
Skype subscriptions normally auto renew at the end of their term.
If you have a Skype subscription for Calls to Canada/USA and do not renew, say the credit card has expired and you have not updated it with Skype, you will need Skype credit to phone landlines and mobile telephones. If you do not phone telephones much, this may be economical. If you are a heavy user of Skype to call phones, consider buying another subscription.

8.51 and both have the split view feature. remember to look in ""more
options"" rather than view mode where you might expect to find it.The ""message sent"" notification is sent to a list control in the main Skype window. In normal view, that is in focus; so JAWS speaks it. I'm betting that JAWS ignores it in split view because it is usually a bad idea to speak
live updates in windows that are not in focus.This problem has nothing to do with JAWS script.It is because of its own design.Microsoft may fix it in near future if you people continue to ask to them.With regards from Inamuddin with the Skype ID:Charlsdarwin1  arguing with a woman is just like reading software’s lisence agreement.At the end you ignore Her everything  and click I agree button.You can contact me via gmail:inamuddin09@...outlook:inam092@...yahoo:inamuddin2010@...AOL:charlsdarwin1969@...Join me with my Skype ID:charlsdarwin1See me on facebook:www.facebook.com/inamuddin786Follow me on my twitter:www.twitter.com/charlsdarwin1Mobile phone:+92-334-3348409Google voice:+1-631-5335683so how can i get the desktop version of skype that has the split view or will that come down the pike in next skype update?Dear friend, according to Microsoft, they have pulled split view for the sake of more improvement, that’s why I recommend you to wait for the next version of Skype.If you are more excited to see split view then and there, then you can use preview of Skype which is definetly has split view.With regards from Inamuddin with the Skype ID:Charlsdarwin1  arguing with a woman is just like reading software’s lisence agreement.At the end you ignore Her everything  and click I agree button.You can contact me via gmail:inamuddin09@...outlook:inam092@...yahoo:inamuddin2010@...AOL:charlsdarwin1969@...Join me with my Skype ID:charlsdarwin1See me on facebook:www.facebook.com/inamuddin786Follow me on my twitter:www.twitter.com/charlsdarwin1Mobile phone:+92-334-3348409Google voice:+1-631-5335683",,,,,1,512,63.21,11.09,47.48,37.04,36.57,22.66,80.86,58.98,50,16.02,10.94,7.42,0,2.15,0.78,0.59,5.08,10.74,5.08,6.45,14.65,8.4,2.73,3.91,0.78,15.43,2.34,1.17,1.56,0.78,0.39,0.39,10.74,0.78,9.96,0.78,1.37,2.34,1.56,0,4.49,0.2,2.73,1.95,0.78,0.98,0.2,0.78,0,0.59,0,0,9.57,5.27,0.2,1.17,0.59,0,2.73,4.1,0,0,1.17,0.2,2.15,0,0,2.15,0.98,0,0.39,0.39,0.2,0,0.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.1,8.98,1.37,0.98,3.91,2.93,0,0,3.32,1.37,5.47,0.98,0.59,0,0.59,0,0,31.64,13.87,2.34,0.2,0,1.17,14.06

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10I have mixed reports on how long it takes for Skype 8, various versions, to switch to a new conversation. The longest I've heard is over 30 seconds, but my experience is more like five now. I mention that in case this is
related to some of the issues you are having.

From your description, I can't tell if you're having Skype problems or script problems. First thing to do would be to type Insert+q from within Skype with the scripts running, to see what revision number you get. If you don't
get a revision number, the scripts are not loading.hi doug

I am running version 137 but everything seems to have corrected itself
so far this morning.

regards

steveI forgot to mention another possible cause: When you first install a set of scripts in recent JAWS versions, you may have to restart JAWS before it will recognize changes to ConfigNames.ini, the file that governs which script
files load for an application or website. That could of course explain the sudden sort-out of issues you then experienced.",,,,,1,229,47.25,40.06,66.87,39.29,20.82,22.27,79.91,63.76,53.28,15.28,7.86,2.62,0,5.24,0,0,7.42,13.1,5.24,3.93,13.1,10.04,3.93,5.24,1.31,16.59,5.24,6.11,1.75,0.44,0.44,0.87,17.47,0.44,17.03,3.06,1.75,1.75,3.93,0.87,6.55,0.44,1.31,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.04,4.8,0,1.31,0,0,3.93,5.24,0,0,0,0,0.87,0.44,0,0.44,2.62,0,0.44,2.18,0,0,0.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.87,0,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.49,6.55,0.44,0.87,3.49,1.31,0.44,0,5.68,1.75,5.68,2.18,0,0,0,0,0,14.85,5.68,4.8,0,0.44,1.75,2.18

Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10This is most curious and a bit concerning. I have received one other report of the Alt+1 issue in Skype 8.77; but I recently installed 8.77 myself and I am not able to reproduce that issue. Alt+1 works
for me as long as there is not a group chat currently on screen.

I am using the default Skype view, where chats appear inside the main window. Let me know if you are trying to do this in split view where the chats are in separate windows. I don't know if Alt+1 ever
worked from a separate window to jump back to the main one.Hello,

I just tried the keystroke after making sure Skype was only showing in one
window.  It didn't work.  To see the chats, I have to go to Chats and route
Jaws to PC, then go down to the bottom of the list that displays and route
PC to Jaws.

AlanIt was working just a couple of hours ago in split view, always has. I tried turning off split view with the same results. I just installed the latest, revision, 203, of the scripts.


GaryHi guys, yes I noticed that too but I didn't know about scripts revision 203, so I was using 197, but I don't think I'll fix it by installing 203.

Doug, if you're using Skype 8.77, also verify the exact version number, considering that with 8.77.0.90 it worked ok, it began happening on 8.77.0.97. Effectively, when there aren't missed calls in reunion or something else, it works ok. BTW, the alternative is to re-activate virtual cursor, and in this case you don't need to route JAWS to pc.

Bye!

Barbuz

-- 
Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10My exact version number, where Alt+1 works as expected, is 8.77.00.97.

I just retested while making sure I'm using script revision 203. JAWS 2021. No problems. I'll probably get to a test under 2022 today or tomorrow.

Again though, Alt+1 is known to fail when a group chat is on screen, even under older Skype versions. That is on my list to examine. For now, I work around it by typing Ctrl+Tab until I have switched
to a non-group chat so that Alt+1 can work again.T is working fine in JAWS 2022.With regards from Inamuddin with the Skype ID:Charlsdarwin1  Sent from Mail for WindowsForgot to mention, I am using Split view mode as well. I am still with JAWS 2021, for the moment I don't think I can upgrade to 2022.

Alt+1 only works in the main window.Hi Stewart,

Split view is a mode where chat windows are separate by the main Skype window. Concerning JAWS 2019, I think it will work, though latest scripts revision increased the minimum JAWS version supported. I think the earliest supported version is 2018 rather than 17.0.

file:///Index.htmlThat's honestly the sort of thing that would happen if the password is wrong or changed. Assuming the email address associated with the account still reaches you, you might try a password reset. I don't know why this issue
would coincide with a Skype update except that a Skype update of course forces Skype to restart.All I did was click on the notification thing, and let it install automatically.  It should load when I restart, which I haven't tried yet.I've reset my password and get the same exact results.



GarySince this sounds then like a Microsoft issue, my next suggestion is the Skype Support page at https://support.skype.com/en/skype/all/

I was going to suggest the Disability Answer Desk, but that page says to go to the above page for Skype support and that the Answer Desk is not able to help with account issues.Doug, can skype be re-installed by downloading the setup file and running it? Haven't heard that suggestion yet.


GaryI was just thinking about that.

Uninstall it, go to

www.skype.com

and download it direct.  I've done that with other versions and it seemd to work.I doubt a reinstall changes a login issue since credentials would be remotely validated; but yes, you should be able to remove Skype and reinstall it.

The Store version and the Desktop version have the same interface but are technically different applications by the way. This issue should also be immune to which of those you run. I've logged in from both myself with the
same account.I just updated to 8.67.0.99 without incident, but mine signs in automatically. Let me know if this one resolves itself; I wonder if it's something like a busy Microsoft server that caused your sign-in to fail temporarily.Mine has just updated to Skype 8.67.99 and signed in without incidence too!With regards from Inamuddin with the skype ID:Charlsdarwin1 Sent from Mail for Windows 10Same here, complete with test call, and messaging.  It all seems

Re: somehow the uninstaller broke the scripts....,"Sounds like somehow you have a skype.jkm remaining in your JAWS user folder. To find it, go to Start, All Programs or whatever your Windows version calls it, your JAWS version, Explore JAWS, Explore My Settings. There may be a
quicker way to get there, but make sure it's ""Explore My Settings"" for your active JAWS version. If you find skype.jkm there, rename, back up, or delete it and try your Alt+1 in Skype again.Deleting  the *jmk file has appeared to fixed it.

    -- 
Inviato da Thunderbird su Windows 10Compare your ConfigNames.ini section against the skype_directives.txt file that now comes with the scripts, to make sure the entries in the directives file are also in the appropriate section of your ConfigNames.ini file.
If you make any ConfigNames changes, restart JAWS to test them.

If that doesn't work, do the same with the slman_directives.txt file. That file is not in the released SLMan though, so I'll include it below. For Skype, the most important entry from that one should be Index.html=slman;
but check all four entries.

If even that doesn't work, though admittedly I doubt this will help, try the updated but not yet released SLMan installer at https://www.dlee.org/updates/jfw_slman.exe

Here is the SLMan directives file:

# Script Load Manager - directives file.
# Consult http://www.dlee.org/code_common.htm#inst_directives for information on how to apply this file during a manual script installation.
.jawsminver 17.0
.ini ConfigNames.ini
[Domains]
Index=slman
Index.html=slman
about:blank=slman
about=slmanI compared the files, and everything seems to be as it should. but the scripts still doesn't work.
After installing the scripts and Slman, my config names.ini file looks like this:
[ConfigNames]
Skype:8=skype
Microsoft.SkypeApp!App=skype
[Domains]
Index=slman
Index.html=slman
about:blank=slman
about=slman

best regards,
AlkorIs your JAWS set to use the same language for which you checked the ConfigNames file?Yes. My jaws is set to Russian and the file ""config names.ini I checked in the folder: \ Settings \ rusIf I get any further ideas, I'll let you know; but for now I don't have any. I have heard of this happening to exactly one other person with a set of scripts, though I don't remember which set. I've also had this problem
on one NVDA project, where NVDA refused to load the add-on for an application. It's a rather frustrating problem of course, because until the screen reader loads my code, I sort of don't have much I can do.I think I found the problem: SLMan was not updated to use the new Skype script basename, because I forgot that it used one at all. Try installing SLMan from https://www.dlee.org/updates/jfw_slman.exe , then restart JAWS
and tell me if that works.Hi Doug,
It still says the not secure thing about windows defender with windows 10,
when you do a new install.

Re: typing sound,"Hi Jerry and all,

I also updated to Skype 8.55, but I figured out some other bugs, for example the split view auto-disaples after a system restart. I did not have chance todeepli test the chat feature, but I need to figure out if there's a bug in typing sounder as well. In the meantime, try pressing insert+v from within Skype, and make sure that the typing sounder option is enabled.

I don't really need it to tell me who's typing when I'm in a chat window.  That's just my opinion.Update: I just had a chat on Skype with a friend of mine and figured out that typing indicators no longer work for me as well. If you hear typing announcement, you probably have split view disabled. I am afraid Skype 8.55 effectively changed something and broke typing indicators functionality.

thanks for the input guys. i'm amazed that Microsoft haven't found

    meaning I think they are built-in hotkeys in Skype. The only thing
    is I'll have to test ctrl+shift+p and make sure it works for
    answering a call, this surely works in order to start an audio call.
    I don't think I can test ctrl+shift+k since I don't use a webcam on
    my desktop Windows machine.

    I find the control-shift-p, and control-e commands work, as long
      as I'm in the skype window.
    For example, I can't answer a call unless I'm actually in the
      skype window.
    In skype classic, I could just use the hot key command whenever a
      call came in.
    Maybe that's the problem, Sugar.I forgot those keys are not global. So yeah you need to be in the skype window in orderr for all of the keys to work now.

This is an annoying problem in Word in general. I am not completely sure
about Word 2016, but press F6 until you get to the various views and change
it to ""draft"" view. That should do it. It is probably on ""print"" view.

Good luck!

Reading Text When Cursor is Positioned Over It 3 messages,"Hello list,

I have been using Fusion but am trying to run Jaws & ZoomText separately.
When running Fusion, Jaws reads whatever my cursor is covering.  For example
as I move the mouse around the desktop, I will hear the various icons
without clicking on them.  This does not happen when I run Jaws & ZoomText
separately.  Supposedly Fusion is just an interface to open them both but
this is a difference I have found.  Does anyone know a setting I can change
in Jaws such that it will speak whatever the cursor is hovering over?  I've
looked in both ZoomText & Jaws & can find nothing to change to get this
behavior.  

Thanks,
Sherry WellsHello Sherry,

When using ZoomText 2019 you can cycle between mouse echo modes by using the
keystroke Alt with caps lock and M.  The options are Instant mode, Hover
mode and Disable.  When you choose the option you want you can set the
program preferences to save changes you made when you exit the program.
When using Fusion the mouse echo options are under the Reader tab of the
interface.  With JAWS you can turn mouse echo on or off by using the layered
keystroke of JAWS key with spacebar followed by e and then O.  You can
change what the mouse echoes by using JAWS key with spacebar, followed by E
and then C for character, W for word, L for line or P for paragraph.  I am
not sure how the JAWS mouse echo settings will work on grids of icons but
the ZoomText commands should work on such items.

Take care.      

Brian Lee
brianllee@...Hi.

Have you tried pressing insert-space, followed by the letter E? This is a layered command for controlling the mouse echo. After pressing the letter E, you can press the following letters.



The following commands are available in the Mouse Echo layer.
Toggle mouse echo On/Off = O.
Set mouse echo to character = C.
Set mouse echo to word = W.
Set mouse echo to line = L.
Set mouse echo to paragraph = P.

Reading and Acting on Notifications in Windows 10 4 messages,"Hi, Folks.  How do I check and see if I have any notifications in Windows 10?  I'm using a desktop PC running Windows 10 and the most current version of JAWS.  Thanks in advance.--Matthew ChaoHold The windows logo key, and tap the letter a, and this should open your notifications for you. I remember it by opening my alert, versus notifications, if that makes it an easier.What I do is hit Windows+A to go to the action center. When it says ""Notifications from X"", arrow right once. It doesn't say treeview, but to me it works like a treeview. You right arrow into each grouping of notifications. For example, there was an update to Java last night. I arrowed to the right into the Java notification node if you will. Then I arrowed down to the actual notification. Then I hit enter to interact with the notification to begin the update.

Here are a couple of notes I've saved and hopefully they'll help.
 
From: david
Hello try;
1, make sure your inside the folder which you wish to rename. 
 
2, press shif+f6key you will hear; mail folders treeview,
 
3, now you can use the f2key to edit the name.
To get back to your message list inside the folder, just press the f6key. 
 
hope this helps.
David  
 
Deleting a folder:
 
When you are in the list of emails do a shift + Tab to get to the folders
list. Now arrow down until you hear the folder you want to delete. Then
press the application key, then arrow down to delete folder and press enter.
Now your folder should be gone. 

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Hi Fred. I use outlook 2016. These instructions should work. From your
inbox, press f6 multiple times until you get to the folders tree view. Then
use either your applications key, or shift f10 to bring up the context menu.
Arrow down to either delete or rename, Press enter and follow instructions.

Hope this helps.Hey, Chris.  Works like a charm.

JAWS Certified, 2014.
http://www.FreedomScientific.com/CertificationI would also like to add that Brian Hartgen's Leasey program does contain a working Amazon search facility, which is available  from within the Leasey search tools. Leasey Search is somewhat similar to Research It but contains items not found in the standard Research It list, such as currency conversion, info on specific artists or albums, performing a Google search, etc. Amazon searches are one of the items which are in the list of search sources. Leasey is not free of cost but is, in my opinion, worth considering as it adds a huge amount of functionality to JAWS. I highly recommend it. The above link will take you to the Leasey page for more information.

David Goldfield, Assistive Technology Specialist WWW.David-Goldfield.ComHi.
Not sure how the Leasey one differs, but standard JAWS Researchit does include currency conversion; it’s is the only one aside from the wiktionary lookup that I use semi-regularly.Hi, JM.

You're absolutely right. I never realized that currency conversion was actually a Research It lookup tool. Thanks for pointing that out.

"Revision 174 of JAWS Skype scripts released, to address six issues","Yes, the subject says ""six issues."" Read release notes at http://www.dlee.org/skype#hist and download scripts from the download link earlier in that same document.

The main issue fixed here is of course the repeating ""Skype"" issue when you Alt+Tab into Skype. Curiously, that issue (as I said here last night) actually resulted from my rename of the script files; but I fixed it without
changing file names again. Other issues are documented in the release notes.

Installation: If you did not install revision 173, follow the directions on that web page for installing 173 when you install revision 174.
If you did install revision 173, just run the 174 installer and let it handle the details.

Finally, an apology: As I mentioned yesterday on this list, I did notice the repetition yesterday morning while starting this update. However, repetition does not usually bother me to the extent that incorrect or missing
information does; I guess I'm sort of used to tuning it out. As a result, the issue did not register on my radar as sufficient to stop the release; and amid all the details of updating JAWS scripts, NVDA add-on code,
documentation, mailing lists, Twitter, Telegram, etc., I rather forgot about the issue until Gary mentioned it here. I have since noticed that a number of folk are severely bothered by repetitions of this sort.

Saving pdf as a Word Document and uncompressing it. 16 messages,"Afternoon all.
 
Using JAWS latest version, Word 13 and Windows 10 on a Dell laptop.
 
I downloaded a compressed portfolio of different files. I have been attempting to unzip the files, and when I press the applications option, I do get the choice for extracting from portfolio. When I press enter on this, it brings up a dialogue for saving it. But not for extracting it. Also, using the shift f10 applications process, I used to get an option for saving it as a word document. But not now. Any ideas/suggestions will be welcome. I am also using Adobe Acrobat DC. Thanks.

“The three things that are most commonly asked for, but never truly wanted, are advice, opinions and the truth.”
 Hi,
Are you trying to open / extract it with Adobe?
You should extract files in a windows file folder first, and then go to that folder to find your file.
GlennHm, isn’t there also such a thing as a “comprssed pdf” file, though?
So I guess the question is, is this really a zip file you are looking at?
 
If it is a zip file, you can actually open it like you would any other folder by pressing enter. If you want the files located/copies elsewhere, all you would have to do is hit ctrl-a to select all, ctrl-c to copy, then move to/open your folder of choice and paste the items there.
 
Again though, it sounds like this might be a different sort of compressed animal entirely.
 Okay. I have the portfolio saved under another folder. When I go to the folder, and right arrow, it first gives me the created date; then it says “type adobe Acrobat document”. Then I open that folder and I get more subfolders. When I right arrow to the information, I used to get the date, and the type. But it does not list this information now. I even tried closing all of my documents files and folder, and reopening them, but it does no good. Very puzzling/aggravating.
 Jerry.
See this page. Maybe it will help you clarify.
 
https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/acrobat/using/overview-pdf-portfolios.html
 
So I guess the question remains: What exactly do you want to do? Do you want these files extracted from the portfolio?
Speaking for myself, I have never actually seen or worked with this type of pdf before, but, they exist, and it uses its own compression scheme to pack the files together. So, not a zip file; the reason your context menu items are not the same.
 Yes. That is exactly what I want to do. I will check out the link you provided. Thanks.
 Good luck.
I’m not sure the free Adobe Reader can do this at all.
 Thanks for all of the advice. Now, I know that there was a posting for “open parent document”, with a button immediately after it. However, I cannot seem to get the document open. Any ideas/suggestions on this one? Thanks again.
 Hi Jerry,
 
When you come to the Parent Document button, if you down arrow is the PDF file there for you to read?  Also, you can give this a try to save the file.
1. On the Parent Document file press, Alt + F, to open the file menu.
2. Down arrow to, Save as..., and press enter.
3. Tab 1 time to, save as type, to make sure Adobe PDF is selected, tab a couple times to the, save button, and press the spacebar or enter.  Now check your Documents folder for the download.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Mike:
The problem I am coming up against is that the file is a download from a website. When I press spacebar on the link, that is when I get the parent document message. And when that comes up, there is nothing after that I can use any arrow keys for. As for the opening of the document and saving it, I tried going through the menu bar, but the save as option is not there; as well as going through the applications/shift f10 keys. Thanks for the reply, though.
Jerry
“When someone calls you up on the phone offering you life insurance, or prepaid burial insurance, do you ever wonder what it is that they know that you don’t?”
 The only way around this is to save the PDF onto your hard drive, such as your downloads folder or your documents folder then closing the internet session, then going into the folder you saved the PDF document and opening it from there, at which point, the document should open and should display properly without the Open Parent document button.
 
You should also be able to save it as another format, though I’m not sure if the standard reader allows this or not, but the pro version does.
 
Good luck.
 
VictorJerry,
If you are using IE the open parent document message is caused by the Adobe Reader   add-on program being enabled.  If this is disabled the PDF document will be opened in Adobe Reader and you can do what you want with it.  That was what the previous discussion  about getting rid of the open parent document message was about.Thanks Douglas. Now could you plese supply me with the instructions for disabling it? Thanks again.
 OK,
In IE  Alt+t – Tools
  Select Internet Options
  Control+Tab to the Programs Page   Press Manage Add-ons
  Tab to Filters selection
  Arrow up or down to All Add-ons
  Hit the space bar to make selection
   Tab to List view of all add-ons
    Use your arrow keys to locate an entry like – Adobe PDF reader Adobe Systems
  This add-on needs to be disabled.  If it is not tab over and disable it.
  Often people have trouble getting the full list of add-ons shown.  There should be 25 or so if the list is complete.  If you don’t see all these make sure you hit the space bar back on the filter selection box to show all add-ons.
  Select close and OK to finalize the changes.
DDThanks. It worked as instructed. Thanks again.
 Hi Jerry,
 
Try the following:
1. Open IE11 and press, Alt + T, to open Tools, arrow down to, Manage Add-ons, and press enter.
2. You should be on, Toolbars and Extensions, and if not make sure this is checked.
3. Tab 1 time to, Filter combobox, and up arrow to, All add-ons.  You might have to down arrow 1 time before you can up arrow to this.
4. Tab 1 time to, List View, and navigate through this list of add-ons to find, Adobe PDF Reader...,
5. With Adobe highlighted and Jaws reports, Enabled, press the application key or Shift + F10 to open the context menu, and press enter on, Disable.
6. Tab to, Close, and press the spacebar, you're done.  Restart IE.

Searching my computer in windows-10 11 messages,"One of the things about windows-10 that is driving me crazy is searching my computer for a particular file or document. In windows-7, it was very simple to do this – go to the start menu and type your search term in the edit box. Windows would search your computer and show you a list of possible files or documents. Now when I do this I may see one document then a bunch of things on the Web that bing has helpfully found for me. I do not, repeat not, want to search the Web using this method and and I don’t want bing to do my searching. How do I go back to the days of yesteryear and just search my computer rather than seeing web choices?
Thanks. JohnThe method I use is to hit Windows+r type c colon backslash and hit enter
Then, hit control+e and type my search and hit enter.

This small software application bypasses Windows search with a lightning quick interface and real-time results for all of the files and folders in your
local hard drive or any subsection of it. The software doesn't do much more than search, but its efficiency, effectiveness, stability, and low system resource
usage make it a keeper utility.
 
The software is split into two main controls: the search box and the results page. When you first run Everything, it will create an index of all the files
and folders on your machine. Unless you have millions of files, the index will be created before you know it. Searching is done in real time, as you type--i.e.
the search term ""rad"" returns 379 objects, ""radio"" returns 160, and ""radiohead"" returns 71, all instantly.
 
The results screen can display seven different fields: Name, Path, Size, Last Write Time, Creation Time, Last Access Time, and Attributes. Sorting by any
field takes a little longer than searching, but only slows down noticeably when you sort more than 1,000 results.
 
Everything also lets users connect to HTTP, FTP, or ETP (Everything Transfer Protocol) servers to allow remote searches, but its functionality is mostly
singular--searching your local PC very quickly with minimal resources, and it accomplishes that well. If you've never struggled with Windows search before,
you might pass Everything by; if your computer is a disorganized mess with files all over the place, Everything might be a wonderful gift.

I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Kevin <kleeva5@...> 8/11/19   #13475  

If you're using the search box on the Start menu, you often get better results if you search for a specific category of results.
One way of limiting  a search to a category is by typing the category followed by a colon followed by your search terms. For example, if you are looking
for a document which is either named fred or contains the word fred, you can type doc:fred. You can use the following words to specify the category which
is searched: app, doc, folder, music, photo, setting, video, and web. Where appropriate you can also use the plural form of these words, so for example,
you could search using either app:fred or apps:fred. You can also use document rather than doc, if you really want to type the extra letters.
 
E-mail is golden!!!
Kevin LeeHi John! there are key phrases that you can type before your file name. For example, you can type d o c and then space and then type the file name. That will bring up all documents. you can type music space and then type the file name and that will cause many more music files to come up. That is a great way to look for files on your computer and get a lot of those Bing search terms out of the way. David Moore

Searching outlook email with W10 6 messages,"I was about to search for anything within my inbox or any other folder. Something changed about a year ago. What is the best way to find an email from a specific sender?
 
Susie StanzelHi Susie,
It depends on your eMail program, but I use shift + control + F, and tab to the criteria you want.
If you make it too specific, you will get too many results.
If for example if you are looking for a message from John Smith, you would be better to search for Smith instead of John, in most cases, unless you get a lot of messages from Smiths, or if you are looking for a message from a .EDU sender, like John.Smith@..., you could look for just EDU in the from field, and if you are looking for a message with the word dog in the message, you can put that in to narrow the search.
But putting criteria in the message body slows it down, because your computer will have to read all the bodies in the eMail folders for that word.
But if you search for messages with Smith in the from field and dog in the message field, it will only read those messages which came from Smith.
HTH.
GlennI am using outlook 365. It had question after question. Will the results simply come up? It even wanted to start over.
 
SusieHi, Suzie,
 
From the inbox, or whatever folder you want to search, I shift-tab to the search field, and enter the sender’s name, or some search string distinctive to the e-mail.  Then tab back to the inbox or whatever folder you are wanting to search.

 Hi, Susie,
 
I am using Outlook 10, so the 365 may be different.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”
 
I've never used that eMail program, but if it is like regular outlook, you will have criteria, and you can jump to the one you want, like alt + U for subject may work for jumping right to the subject field.
But you will get better at searching your messages and it will become quite efficient once you get used to the options and the hotkeys.

Since some Skype 8 versions you can now have separate chat windows, you do that by going in the more options button with tab, hit a space, then in the menu that appears choose: ""Show Double view window"", and you press enter. Note that it's better to do it whithout a call active, if my memory does not go wrong this option is not available when a call is going on.

Setting the Hotkey for Restarting JAWS 34 messages,"Hi, Folks.  I want to set up a hotkey combination for restarting JAWS. I want to youse ctrl-plus-alt-j to make this happen.  How do I go about doing that?  Thanks in advance.--Matthew ChaoGo to the JAWS icon on the desk top, press alt+enter--this will open the properties, tab over to shortcut hot key--press the letter or number that you want to use as the hot key, for example: 'j', then tab to ok. When you need to reload JAWS just press alt+ctrl+j, (or what ever key you set),  and JAWS will reload.The only other thing I would add to this and it's purely optional is to consider instead of using the J key as the hotkey, using a number corresponding to the version of Jaws.
I've got Jaws 2019 and 2018 on both my machines and have the corresponding control+alt+number for both. I've always done it this way since I tend to keep my computers through multiple releases of Jaws and don't have to worry about any conflicts and can still start an alternate version of Jaws in the rare case that I may need it.
Again though, purely optional.Hi

As stated above, you can define a key to start JAWS so the combination of Control+alt+(Chosen key(s)) will start a new copy of JAWS.    However it used to be that it will only start a new copy of JAWS and not stop a currently running copy of JAWS.  So as I have seen, you can have 2 copies of JAWS jabbering away at each other.  So to recycle JAWS, you first have to stop the currently running copy and then start the new copy of JAWS.  I believe that this is still true.

MikeHi,
Typically if Jaws is already running, running Jaws again only brings up the Jaws main window.
Also, you can use many different key combinations to call up Jaws, as long as it does not conflict with a key combination already in use by another application.
I like to use shift + control + J for Jaws.
In the shortcut window, when defining a hotkey, if you only press one key, the default keys to go with it are control + alt.
GlennMy issue is that periodically this hot key disappears and I have to set it again.

AndyI also have the vanishing Jaws hot key.  However, when I tried to replace it, my computer said that I did not have ""Administrator"" rights.

Since I own this computer and no one else uses it, what does this mean and how do I make it allow me this?

Thanks very much for any help!

Sincerely, Vicky VWhen that happens press the spacebar.

AndyYou should go to users in control panel and see if there is a separate administrator account, and if so, find out from the person who set up the computer what the administrator's password is.
I hate it when computer technicians do that.
Glenn
I would like to see a hot key that would shut down JAWS and immediately restart it. Window Eyes had a hot key that would do this.This is a windows10 security feature don’t worry about it just press the spacebar or enter and whatever you are doing will be done.
 Vicky:

Whenever I get the message about needing administrative rights, I just hit the enter key, and am then allowed to do what I need to do.

I'm using Windows 10 version 1809 here.

Tom BehlerHi and thanks guys!  I’m not sure whether it was the Enter or the Space Bar that did the trick, but my computer has now let me make the Jaws shortcut icon.
 
Gratefully Yours,
Vicky VDoes Windows 10 have UAC (user account control) that can be turned down like in 7?
 Glenn/Lenny:
 
I think it does, but I never mess with it.
 
I just allow the given app to make changes to my computer, and move on from there.
 
Tom Behler
 Yes it does I turn mine to 0 however you will still get the admin prompt when setting up a shortcut.
 Hi Glenn,
 
Yes it does.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
No one has more to say than the woman who says she doesn't want to talk about it. Hi Andy,
The reason this happens in earlier versions of Jaws, is that during
the update process, the original shortcuts are over-written.
I believe this was supposed to be corrected in the last update for Jaws.
An alternative for having a user assigned hotkey would be to pin Jaws to the 
task bar, without assigning a hotkey.
Then, pressing the Windows key plus one of the number keys on the number row 
corresponding to Jaws would start Jaws that version of Jaws.
I have all versions of Jaws on my systems set this way,
that way I have only a 2 key combination to press instead of 3.
I believe Mike B may have posted these steps to the list some time ago.

Sign ing problems,"Hi,

I have a problem with a friend of mine where she is not able to sign in to Skype. During a Tandem session I figured out Skype is asking her for a code, but I realized on delay that Skype has got a mail which probably she does no longer use. I did not see an option, say, for using sms. At this point, do we need to create a new Skype account?

Bye!

"Skype 8 (Electron) scripts updated, not a beta","I did not get as many testers as I hoped for, but all reports I did get were good...

So I am releasing what is now revision 121 of the Skype 8 (Electron) scripts. These are functionally identical to the revision 119 beta scripts I released recently.

Translators: I am updating my internal translation management system a bit this week while I have time to do so. This should not impact the process from your standpoint; but let me know if you get any surprises.

Feature changes between my last non-beta release (revision 113) and revision 121 appear at the website for the scripts; but in summary:
* Dates again speak as you navigate through chat history messages.
* The scripts try to adjust how they are loaded based on your JAWS version. If you are prompted once to restart JAWS on first using these new scripts, no worries; that is normal.

The location for Skype 8 scripts and documentation remains https://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/

"Skype 8 scripts updated, with new way to load them in old JAWS versions","I have released an update to the Skype 8 scripts to make JAWS name the split-view chat windows including online status and/or mood text, as is already done for conversations displayed inside the main window. These are at
https://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/ as usual.

If you are running the August JAWS 2019 update, you will only need the above scripts for Skype 8.51 support. If you are running any other JAWS version supported, 17.0 through pre-August JAWS 2019 versions, read on.

For various reasons, I have split out the system for loading Skype 8 scripts in older JAWS versions into a new and separate set of scripts, which I am calling Script Load Manager, or SLMan. These are at
https://www.dlee.org/slman/

If you want further information on this system and why I created it, listen to my audio explanation, which is about five minutes long, at https://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/skype_slman.mp3

The basic process to run, for anyone upgrading Skype scripts, is this:

1. Install the updated Skype scripts, which will first uninstall your current Skype scripts as usual.

2. Install the Script Load Manager.

That combination should make the Skype scripts load properly into any JAWS version 17.0 through current 2019. This finally even includes making JAWSKey+v load the Quick Settings for Skype rather than loading the Quick Settings
for Chrome.

Warnings:

The Script Load Manager is a pretty new idea, though I built it on ideas I had already been using for Skype and other apps. As was already true for the Skype 8 scripts, there remains the possibility that the Script Load Manager
will cause side effects in other environments. In particular, any website or web application that uses a URL like file:///Index.html or about:blank for the focused page may cause odd behavior, especially in a non-Chrome
browser. I would appreciate notification of any such occasions found by users out there, as I don't know a quick way to test all cases here.

I already tried uninstalling and reinstalling Skype with no success, but now since I updated to this version it's now working as expected, meaning that only the effectively selected tab appears like this.

There is still another long-standing problem though were I am not able to listen to voice messages, but I need to investigate if it deals with something with my wireless or what else.

"Skype 8.78 for Windows desktop, conversation list works better","Hi list, as in subject I noticed throug ninite
        that Skype 8.78 is now out, so I installed it by going to Skype
        website. Now the list of contacts and chat work better, you
        might encounter that during a call when pressing alt+numbers the
        situation is similar to what we had with 8.77.0.97, even in
        contact list right now, but now you only need to tab some times
        and you'll find the list ok.
    For those having Skype for Windows store, I am not
        sure if the updates will really get late or what else, you can
        try to force the updates and you do that by going in the show
        more button, then choose download and updates in the menu, and
        hit the button which says recover updates. You will at that
        point get all the updates, again I can't guarantee that Skype
        will be updated but that's worth a try.
    Bye!

Skype Desktop App Receives Back Split View,"Hi,

    Given the discussion about this, I thought you guys might be
    interested on reading the article below from Winaero,
    coming just in time :)

    

    Skype Desktop App Receives Back Split View

    
    As you may already know, Microsoft is about to retire the classic
    Skype app in November 2018. One of its most popular features, Split
    View, is finally coming to the latest Skype Desktop.

    Skype Desktop joins the Store app, which has received the same
    feature in October 2018.

    

      

      The new Skype Desktop app has a very streamlined user interface.
      It follows the modern trend of flat minimalist design with glyph
      icons and no borders anywhere. This design is being used in all
      other Microsoft products. It is an Electron-based application.

      Split View is a special mode of the app that allows having each
      conversation in a separate window, rather than showing them all in
      a single window merged with the contact panel.

      The Split View feature is available in Skype Desktop starting with
      Insider Preview version 8.51.76.74. 

      

      As of this writing, this feature is exclusively available to the
      Skype App Preview program users. To try the feature, you need to
      click on the menu button with three dots (""..."") and then select
      ""Enable Split View mode"" from the menu.

      After that, the main window will display your contacts only.
      Double-click on any contact to open a new conversation in a new
      window.

      To restore the default appearance, use the Open recent chats
      button available in the top left corner of any chat window. Also,
      the Split View feature can be disabled in the main menu (""..."").

      This new mode should be welcomed by users of the classic Skype
      app. Microsoft is actively working to move users from Skype 7 to
      the modern Skype 8.

Skype Electron Replaces Universal App on the Store: the users need to make this change to continue using it,"Hello respected members on skype mailing list,

I’ve come up with good news that will affect skype universal app users
and surprise electron users on the other. Since skype 8.61, Microsoft
officially replaces their universal app with the Chromium based version of
skype. From now on, there will be single version of skype available to both
store and regular users of skype.

Those who use skype electron can continue using it. However, those who
rely on universal app may need to update their config names.ini file available
in the explore my settings folder i.e. the user settings directory. I hope the
author will soon commit this change, and all users of skype electron and skype UWP
will receive same scripts for their applications.

Till then, I am going to describe the way how people can make this
change and continue their experience.

First you need to go to JAWS user settings directory.

To do so, open jaws window jaws key + j.

Go to utilities and click “explore utilities folder”; you can press
letter x to directly open utilities folder.

The utilities folder will open in file explorer.

Press letter e till you find an item with the name of “explore my
settings”.

Press enter on it.

When it opens, type letter c till you find a file with the name of “ConfigNames.INI”.

Press enter on it; it will open in notepad.

Keep arrowing down till you find this line “Microsoft.SkypeApp!App=skypeuwp”.

Type home key to go to the start of the line.

Press semicolon to comment the current entry. Now, hold the shift key
and keep pressing right arrow.

When JAWS announce ‘equals’, leave the shift key and press control + c
to copy the selected or highlighted text.

Type end key to go to the end of the line. Press enter there. Now, paste
the text that you just copied earlier.

Now, find another line that says “Skype:8=skypeelectron”.

Copy the text after equals sign and return to the line where you pasted
some text before. Press end key to go to the end of the line and press control
+ v to paste. Now, press control + s to save. Close notepad, and other two
windows of file explorer that you opened in the start. Now, restart the JAWS
application. Congress, you can now use electron version of skype from Microsoft
store.",,,,,1,396,86.07,61.07,93.02,42.71,13.2,17.68,76.26,56.82,42.68,8.84,5.05,1.26,0,2.27,0,1.01,3.79,12.63,6.57,1.26,14.14,3.79,4.29,6.06,0,13.38,6.06,2.27,1.77,0.25,0,1.52,12.63,0.25,12.37,4.29,3.28,1.77,0.76,0,2.78,0,1.77,1.52,0,0.76,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,7.83,3.03,0.25,0.25,0,0,2.78,5.3,0,0,0,0,1.77,0.25,0,1.52,3.54,0,0.76,2.27,0.51,0,1.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,1.26,9.6,11.36,0.25,4.04,7.83,0,0,0,7.83,1.01,3.79,2.78,0,0,0,0,0,18.94,9.09,4.04,0,0.25,0.51,5.05
Skype Microphone Not Working on Windows 10? 8 Ways to Fix It,"Skype was probably the first successful cross-platform video
    conferencing app in the world that really took off. It's a pity that
    even after so many years, it continues to slow Windows computers
    down and cause all sorts of problems. Skype has always been plagued
    with some of the other issues. Case in point: the microphone. There
    are many users who have been facing the Skype microphone not working
    issue on Windows 10 PC.

    To check if your microphone is working properly on Skype, you can
    make a test call to Echo,
    it'll record your message and play it back to you. If you can't hear
    your voice back, then there is a chance, your Mic is not working. In
    this post, we will take a look at some settings that you should
    enable in order for it to work and some troubleshooting steps that
    will help resolve the issue.

    Let's begin.

      Skype Microphone Not Working

      
      1. Reinstall

      
      Why? When you install Skype for the first time, you are asked to
      give some necessary permissions that help Skype function
      correctly. One of those permissions is access to the microphone.

      

      I know what you are thinking. There is no need to reinstall Skype
      to give necessary microphone permissions. True. But reinstalling
      an app can also remove bad and corrupted files from the system. A
      fresh install can solve quite a few software problems. This is why
      it is the first step.

      Don't worry about your contacts and other data as they will all
      appear once you log back in using your Microsoft account.

      2. Install Directly

      
      Microsoft got a lot of things right with the Windows 10 and
      Windows Store is one of them. All Microsoft owned and developed
      software are now available in a single place which is reliable and
      pre-installed on all licensed Windows PC. The thing is that many
      users have reported that installing software directly from the
      developer's site solves the microphone issue. To do so, visit the
      Skype site using the link below and select Skype for Windows and
      not Skype for Windows 10 from the drop-down menu.

      Install it and see if the microphone on Skype is working or not.

      3. Microphone Permissions

      
      It is also possible that even after you gave the necessary
      permissions to Skype to use and communicate via the microphone,
      due to a bug or change in setting, it was toggled off in the
      Windows Settings itself. To check, press the Ctrl+I keys on the
      keyboard and select Privacy.

      Select Microphone from the left window pane and scroll a little to
      find a list of all the apps that need to use the microphone. Find
      Skype in the list and make sure it is toggled on.

      Check if Skype microphone is working on your laptop.

      4. Skype Audio Settings

      
      Just like Windows 10 settings, there are audio settings inside
      Skype that you need to check to make sure that volume, speakers,
      and the correct microphone are selected. To do that, open Skype on
      Windows 10 and click on the menu icon to go to Settings.

      Select Audio and Video in the left-pane and you will see different
      options. Make sure that the correct Microphone device is selected.
      Sometimes, there are more than one. For example, in my laptop,
      there is Realtek High Definition Audio and Default communications
      device. Do not select the default one as it won't work in most
      cases.

      

      To be on the safer side, select Automatically adjust microphone
      settings option. This will tell Skype to manage settings to the
      optimum level. Alternatively, if it was already selected and the
      microphone was not working, you may try and deselect that option.
      Maybe Skype was not managing it the right way?

      5. Sound Drivers

      
      Drivers are a necessary component of every software that you
      install on a Windows computer. The job of a driver is to allow the
      software to connect and communicate with the hardware device, in
      our case, it is the sound card. If the drivers are out of date or
      the files are corrupted, it may lead to irregularities in the
      functioning of the microphone on Skype. Open Device Manager by
      searching for it in the Windows Start button menu. Find and
      double-click on Sound, video, and game controllers option.

      Your sound card should be listed here. Scroll down a little to
      find and select the same sound card that you had selected in the
      Skype settings above and right-click on it to select Update
      drivers option.

      This will take some time and I recommend you to close Skype and
      reboot your computer once before testing if Skype microphone is
      working properly or not.

      6. Restart Windows Audio Service

      
      For every software or app installed on Windows, there is a
      respective service that runs in the background and does the heavy
      lifting. For the microphone and other audio services, it is the
      Windows Audio service. Make sure it is running and if not, start
      it. To do so, press the Windows key+R on your keyboard to open the
      Run command prompt. Type services.msc and hit Enter.

      Search for Windows Audio in the list and right-click on it to
      Start it. If it is already running, the option would be grayed
      out. In that case, you should click on the Restart option. This
      should jump start things.

      

      If the service was not running when you checked, it is possible
      that by default, it is set to not run when the computer reboots.
      We don't want that because that would mean you going through all
      the steps all over again. So, click on Properties on the same
      menu. Under the General tab, Select Automatic in the Startup type
      drop-down menu.

      Click on Apply and OK when done. Check if Skype microphone is
      working on your Windows 10 computer.

      7. Exclusive Control

      
      Skype is not the only software on your computer that needs to use
      the microphone. There can be a number of services other than
      Skype. Sometimes, some apps will go a step further and take
      exclusive control over the microphone, disallowing any other app
      to use it. Sad. In our world, it's called a monopoly which is
      always bad for the end users.

      To check, open Control Panel and navigate to the following
      settings screen.

      Control Panel > Sound > Recording tab. There, double-click
      on the Microphone option to reveal a popup. Select the Advanced
      tab here and make sure that both the options under the Exclusive
      mode are unselected.

      
        Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device
        Give exclusive mode applications priority
      
      8. Configure Bluetooth Devices

      
      Are you using a Bluetooth device to communicate using Skype? This
      can also be a solution if the default microphone on your laptop is
      not working due to any other reason. In that case, try a headphone
      or an earphone with a Bluetooth. If that is not working either,
      search for Manage Audio Devices in the Windows Search. Under the
      Playback tab, you will see that your connected Bluetooth device is
      listed twice.

      The first option is the hands-free option which should be disabled
      if you want to use the connected headphone's microphone. If it is
      not disabled, to do so, right-click on the hands-free Bluetooth
      headphone option and select Disable to disable it. Note that the
      second listing should stay enabled.

      There is also an option to make the connected Bluetooth device as
      your default device. That way, you won't have to go through all
      the troubleshooting steps the next time you open Skype to chat
      with your friends and relatives. To do so, in the same menu, you
      will find Set as default device option. If it is available, click
      on it then enable it.

      Skype Microphone Not Working Issue

      
      Skype is a great software however not without its flaws. The
      microphone issue is not something new however some of the
      solutions mentioned in this guide are. So make sure to go through
      all the steps mentioned in the guide to resolve the issue.

      

      Cheers,

Skype UWP discontinued?,"I was just informed by a coworker of the following post:

Microsoft replace Skype UWP app with Desktop Electron version: https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-replace-skype-uwp-app-with-desktop-electron-version/

Note that this is an MSInsider post, not a formal Microsoft announcement. Still, I regard it as both a public post and an indication of what is coming, all therein-contained opinions about the wisdom of this change aside.

This move does not surprise me, and that is one reason that I, though I made several partial efforts, never fully completed an up-to-date set of JAWS scripts for Skype UWP.

My JAWS scripts for Skype for Windows Desktop remain current and work with Skype 8.57, the current Skype for Windows Desktop release. I expect I will make them work with Skype 8.58 if necessary when that comes out to the public.

If the above announcement actually means that the Store Skype UWP version will become identical to the Skype for Windows Desktop version we now use, I also expect I'll try to make my scripts work for the Store app just as
they do for the Desktop app.

Skype blocks with NVDA,"Hi guys,

a friend of mine is having a problem with latest version of Skype using NVDA. He called me saying that with tab he was unable to manage anything, and on an NVDA Remote session I discovered that Skype is really blocked. I figured out that he had an old version of Skype addon for NVDA and this was incompatible with NVDA 2019.3, so I updated it; I also discovered that he has 73 unread conversations, and that he needs to install authomatic Windows update, though they're already downloaded and so the system asks for be restarted. Do you think that  one of the two could be the problem? If it's the unread conversations, I am afraid he will need to close his screen reader and search for sighted assistance in order to mark them as unread...

Bye!

Skype info kept,"Hi all.


I actually remember some of you sent out links, and other information concerning skype, at least over that last year or so.

I, for one, kept the ones I thought I really needed, and So far, I'm managing to figure out the new skype version, especially after downloading the scripts.

I'm still trying to figure out the chat features, but, I'm getting there.

Mr. Kahn's tutorial, and the manual with Doug's scripts proved really helpful, along with the other stuff I managed to keep.

A little thought and initiative can go a long way.

I many not get there as quickly as some.  But, I'll get there.

The new skype's not the disaster some of us thought.

A little inconvenient, perhaps; but, the key word here is Little.

I've gotten a lot of help after signing onto this list, and it's appreciated.

Skype is unified! Skype UWP for Windows 10 is now the same as Skype for Windows Desktop! Here's what will happen and what to do.,"NVDA users, there's something in here for you, too; this is mostly but not entirely for JAWS folk.

Someone with a nice actor voice should now mutter quietly, after the fashion of many movies, ""I have waited a long time for this moment.""

As was announced earlier on this list already, Skype for Windows 10, formerly a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application, is now identical to our well-known Skype for Windows Desktop app. Finally, after years of
confusion, we have exactly one Skype for Windows again!

This message contains three sections: what you should do now, what will happen automatically, and what will happen to scripts. The final of these sections will also include my plans for NVDA support.

What you should do now:

If you have installed JAWS scripts for Skype UWP for Windows 10, remove them. If you used the script installer to install them, there will be an Uninstall entry in your Start menu for them. If you installed them manually,
remove files from your JAWS user folder that contain ""skypeuwp"" in their names, and then remove any ConfigNames.ini entries that mention ""skypeuwp"" on the right side of the = sign. I advise this because trying to use the old
Skype UWP scripts with the new Electron replacement will result in sluggish behavior.

If you want access to Skype for Windows 10 immediately, though I intend to release a script update for this later today, follow the advice given earlier on this list to make the current Skype for Windows Desktop scripts work
with Skype for Windows 10. Otherwise, wait a few hours and run the installer I plan to release soon. Manually updating ConfigNames.ini will not cause problems for you later when you run the new installer I am about to release.

What will happen automatically:

Along with your Microsoft store updates whenever they run (or when you run them), Skype for Windows 10 will quietly morph into the Electron app we've been using for years. Skype for Windows Desktop, if you have it installed,
will continue to work normally. The two should look and perform alike.

What will happen to scripts (and NVDA add-ons):

Later today, I plan to release a new set of scripts to cover the unified Skype. This will actually be the same code as was used for Skype for Windows Desktop. There are a few changes though:

1. The installer will change from ""JAWS Scripts For Skype for Windows Desktop 8 (Electron)"" to just ""JAWS Scripts For Skype for Windows.""

2. The installer's file name will change from jfw_skypeelectron.exe to just jfw_skype.exe.

3. The URL https://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/ will still work, but the official URL will now be https://www.dlee.org/skype/ and the scripts will actually reside there.

4. The names of files for the scripts will now include just ""skype"" rather than ""skypeelectron."" This is consistent with the file naming conventions now used by JAWS itself for Skype support.

5. I will send another announcement here when the release occurs, and that announcement will include further information on how to upgrade.

Regarding NVDA add-ons:

I have been for a long time hosting a small NVDA add-on for Skype for Windows Desktop at https://www.dlee.org/skype/electron/skype.nvda-addon

I intend to do the following for this add-on after releasing the JAWS updates:

1. Adjust any names to correspond to the Skype unification as I am doing for JAWS.

2. Create a folder for Skype NVDA support as I do for other projects, and move the add-on there.

3. Make the add-on support Skype for Windows 10 if possible, the issue being how to make the add-on load for it as it already does for Skype for Windows Desktop.

Again, I will make another announcement when I have more for NVDA. I'm sending this much information now though in case people out there have pages pointing directly to the add-on at its current location, which will go away
at some point.

"Skype issues that I see, response to several messages on this list today","Let me address some claims I've seen, today on this list and elsewhere over time, about Skype for Windows, and some of my own claims besides:

Claim 1: Skype online status is sometimes wrong.

True. In the past few weeks, I've seen a Skype status of ""Last seen days ago"" for contacts I saw less than six days earlier. To my initial alarm, that message has for some time been widely recognized as meaning that you are
blocked by the contact. I find this no longer to be the case; I've seen friends and professional colleagues alike display as ""Last seen days ago"" without having blocked me.

Claim 2: Skype mood text can be wrong.

True. For quite a while and through several Skype 8 versions, I've seen the mood text for one contact stay active while I switched through chats with several other contacts, until I happen to open a chat with another contact
who actually has a mood text. In short, the mood text does not clear until it is changed to a new message. I have repeatedly reported this bug to Microsoft but have not seen any sign of it being addressed.

Claim 3: ""File sent"" no longer speaks after a file transfer.

Not sure about this one. I do know that ""File sent"" finally stopped speaking after the sending of a chat message, but I don't send files much. I also know that both of those messages are not likely to speak if you split your
chat windows out from the main Skype window, because of the way the Skype notifications work.

Claim 4: Skype UWP for Windows 10 is going away.

Mixed. Reliable indications exist that Skype UWP will become like, or become equal to, Skype for Windows Desktop in some way. I don't know if the Store app is going away entirely; but since it comes with Windows 10 now, I
doubt it. Those on the Windows Insider program, which I am not, can probably say more about this one.

Claim 5: Focus sticks to the ""1 star"" button after a Skype-to-phone call.

Uncertain but reliably reported. If anyone else has seen this one, please let me know. I have not seen this one on my machine, and I make a fair number of Skype-to-phone calls; but I may have just jumped past it too fast.

I hope this message helps clear up a few uncertainties for people.

        language-dependent things or what else:
    
      typing indicators don't work in split view,

"Skype sign-in focus problem finally identified, workaround available","Now and then over the last few months, I received reports from people who suddenly got signed out of Skype and could not sign back in. Invariably, the ultimate complaint was that Tab, Shift+Tab, and pretty much every key on
the keyboard appeared to do nothing. Here I present some details and sort of a workaround to the problem.

First, why are people being signed out?

I believe when you switch between two different clients on a single machine, specifically between the Microsoft Store client and the Desktop client, you are automatically signed out and must sign in again. There may also be
cases where changing between Skype versions will cause this, though that's a guess.

Why does the keyboard stop working?

When the sign-in screen first appears, it works fine. However, if you mistype a password and sign-in fails, the next screen does not work. Though I have not determined fully the reason for this, JAWS becomes confused as to
what is in focus. There appear to be several subcases of this issue; namely, first screen appearance, after Tab has been used in this screen one or more times, after Alt+Tab has been used, and possibly a fourth case after Tab
has been used subsequent to Alt+Tab. It looks possible (though tricky) to script for this problem, but the problem absolutely should be fixed in Skype itself and will be far more reliable when fixed there.

Unfortunately, the only workaround I currently know is to shut down Skype, such as with Ctrl+Q, bring it up again, and type very carefully. :-) This works because the first sign-in screen to appear works properly.

I just submitted via Feedback in Skype itself the following entry:

URGENT: Screen readers can't use the sign-in screen after the first failed login attempt because they become confused on location of focus. Steps to reproduce: Sign out, try sign-in with wrong password, try to sign in again.
Workaround: Unload Skype with Ctrl+Q, relaunch, and make no mistakes on first attempt.

Speech will not stay muted 5 messages,"HI.
I recently got a Focus 40 braille display and am running it through JAWS 2018. Everything’s working pretty great, for the most part, and I’m very happy. One of the things I like most is being able to turn the speech off and use braille only sometimes. This is particularly great when there are other people around and I don’t want to distract/bother/advertise my actions to them.
As I understand it, jaws key + space, s is the speech toggle, and it can be set to either “speech on demand” or “speech mute”. I was using it with some success until recently. But it doesn’t seem to – stick. Even now, I press insert-space, s, and jaws says “speech mute”, but, well, the speech is  not muted.
Am I missing something? This is, in theory, just what I want, isn’t it?
Just now I unloaded JAWS, reloaded it, and tried again. The speech mute toggle is working again. But this is the second time I’ve had to reload JAWS in the last ten minutes to fix this.
 
Anyone have any pointers?
 
ThanksThere’s something I find really irritating about JAWS that may bee relevant. If you press insert-escape to refresh the screen, it will also turn on sound that has been muted. I’ve asked Eric and JAWS tech support to separate the two commands, but in vain.
 You could remap the refresh screen command, and that might not bring back speech.
GlennYeah, that’s very strange also.
 
So, I’ve figured out that when I restart jaws, the speech mute works, until I go to Skype and start looking at my message history. From that point on, speech mute is broken. This could have something to do with the scripts for Skype from Doug lee that I installed, or it could be the native JAWS 2018 Skype scripts. Either way, skype or the scripts seem to be turning my speech on. The worst thing about this is that, after this happens, the toggle simply will not work – even going into settings centre and setting the speech to “no speech” doesn’t stick.
 I like this idea, but I’d prefer to change the keystroke for the sound function. However, I don’t know what this sound function is called. I can’t find any label that fits it.
I know how to get to the list of functions, but how about a list of alphabetized keystrokes? This way I might be able to locate the name of the sound function and also make sure I don’t select a keystroke that has already been assigned.

mean that split-view mode is officially present and supported now.

I briefly tested my latest Skype 8 scripts (revision 129) against this, and found things working normally. The messages like ""Message sent"" may still not speak though, because there is no list of accessibility messages in
individual chat windows like there is in the main Skype window.

While I'm at it... In case I only said this on Twitter and not on this list: If you marvel that I just said my latest scripts are revision 129 while my website clearly boasts revision 130, never fear; they are the same thing. I
neglected to update the revision number in my final release, but the script code is correct.

Splitting a Word file while using JAWS 9 messages,"Hi. I have a Word file that’s so long (1,400 pages), JAWS keeps stalling when I do a search. So I decided to locate the halfway point of the file, select the rest, cut it, and then paste it into a new document. However, I keep getting a message that Word “isn’t responding.” Naturally, JAWS also stops responding.
 
I tried selecting smaller and smaller sections (200 pages, even 100), but Word just won’t cooperate. I also tried converting the file to a .TXT file, but with even less success.
 
I’m using the latest JAWS, Word 2016 and Windows 10-1809. Any ideas? Any workarounds?Hi Adrian,
Do you cut, or do you copy?
I ask because cut is usually not ever the option to use unless you want to move text from one place to another, like you are editing and you think, hmm, this part of the sentence should go before, not after.
So you cut it and paste it somewhere else.
Or possibly you did copy and are using the word ""cut"" indiscriminately.
When you ""cut"", it means to remove it from here.
If so, try to copy, and not cut.
 
GlennHi Glenn,
 
I did mean cut, as in cut from the current document to paste into another. Just in case, I just now tried copying instead of cutting, but went through the same time-consuming and fruitless performance.Can you convert it to an RTF file?
WordPad should open it by default, or if Word still opens the RTF file, use open with and select Wordpad.
HTH.
 That worked. Thanks. I’m still open for a faster, less complicated solution, but I’m glad to have this option.
 Adrian,
Are you using a computer with a minimal amount of RAM?
If not, maybe you need to reboot, or increase your virtual RAM.
HTH.
GlennIf anything, I overdid RAM. And yes, I did reboot at one point.Hello Adrian,
 
Sometimes using draft view and stopping background repagination helps speed up navigating in Word.  I don’t know if doing those things will help but you might want to try.  You cannot stop the repagination of a large document in print view as Word needs to continually show pages the way they would be if printed.  You can switch to draft view under the view tab of the ribbon.  To stop background repagination you first need to be in draft view or the option doesn’t even show in the advanced category of the Word options.  After changing to draft view go into the Word options and choose the advanced category.  One of the last groups in this category is General.  It is faster to repeatedly use shift Tab to get to the General group. There will be a “enable background repagination” checkbox that you can uncheck and then use OK.  While in draft view you won’t get the information about the placement of the text or graphics and how the pages will appear if printed.  For example, in print view you might use Alt with delete to hear that the cursor is one inch from the left.  In draft view you might hear that it is at 0 inches.  When you change back to print view the repagination will start again.
 
I don’t know if this will help but it might be worth checking it out.
 
Take care.

 Brian, thank you so much. My problem with the first file has been solved, but I’ll use this approach for the next one. I have several large files that I need to break down. I’m confident your method will work. I also appreciate the warnings so that I won’t be worrying when the format changes in draft view.

Status update: Outlook calendar issue 5 messages,"Hi all.
Many months ago, I spoke to the Tech Support folks at The Sparrow and then wrote an entry to this list.
A few replies said… thanks, keep us posted.
 
Okay, consider this email a call to action… grassroots CUSTOMER (that's YOU and me) support/turmoil.
 
The problem: due to a bug in Jaws Outlook 2016 (and probably other supported versions) does not give correct schedule information in day and month formats.
 
I am using latest Jaws 2019 and Windows10 products.
 
I had to update from Outlook 2010 to 2016 for them to talk to me about this issue.
 
The Sparrow acknowledges the issue and has given it a priority 3.
 
I have waited 4 to 6 months for a correction. Nothing timely happens on priority 3 problems.
My calendar has become just about worthless.
I hear 8 appointments and there are 2…. I hear 13 appointments for the day and there are 3, I hear 5 appointments and there are 0 appointments.
 
I have lost my patience.
As they say at Joe's Garage, ""the wheel that squeaks the loudest gets greased and repaired!""
 
Do you have this problem and have been passively sitting around ignoring it?
Stop. Call Tech Support and complain, complain, complain.
I just made that phone call…. had a productive discussion and am now writing this note.
Tell them that the tracking number is -
""The key tracking number in our development database on your multiple appointment issue is:
BZ 106500
 
Let's get some action.
Let's get Outlook Calendar working correctly.
 
Thank you for your anticipated cooperation..
Onward,
Ken
 Hello,
 
Thanks for your email. I use my Outlook Calendar for work everyday; it’s set to “day view” and I’m using JAWS. I am, however, not experiencing the issues you’re describing. When I open my calendar today, for example, JAWS tells me I have three appointments and two all day events. When I then press tab and shift+tab each appointment or event is read to me by JAWS. I’ll look at my calendar settings, but I don’t recall changing other items for JAWS to work as well as it does for me.

 Thanks for the reply.
I have reviewed my settings with Microsoft and The Sparrow. They did not make any changes.
Yes, it should work as it does on your computer. It was that way for years before this problem appeared months ago.
As mentioned in my note, The Sparrow told me that others had spoken to them about this issue.

 Thanks for the call to action. I have really disliked the way JAWS reads the Outlook calendar. I was so used to the little special appointment dialog that Window Eyes offered.  If I really want to skim my calendar, I pull it up on my iphone, since my work calendar is synced there and that allows me to much more efficiently look ahead at my appointments.  I really dislike that JAWS tries to tell me how many appointments are on a day, as I find it very confusing and I am probably experiencing what you are experiencing, but just hadn’t tried to articulate it.
 
I will get some notes together and call this into Vispero, too.

 I also use the day view and do find that much more usable than the week view.  As I was just playing with it, I think the issue for me is largely the level of verbosity moving from day to day.  It does work better to arrow left and right to move through days, instead of trying to tab through events.  What I like about looking at my schedule on the iPhone is that I can flick quickly through all events, skipping past empty days.  With all the verbosity, I find this much more cumbersome using tab to do this on the laptop with JAWS. If I only wanted to arrow to a new day and then tab through the events for that day, I think it would work better.  Not sure that I’m seeing the erroneous reporting of event counts for a given day, but it’s just too verbose sometimes for me and I wish the day was first before the event count.

CaseyMike, 
I use an external synthesizer and occasionally have the same issue. I have a suggestion: Instead of going into the options menu, press control-JAWS key-s to bring up the profiles list, which you can navigate with the arrow keys or by first letter. Press enter on your synth, and it should come up speaking. Much faster than the options menu.Thanks Adrian.  That works .

Mike, I suspect that you haven't set your Vocalizer profile as default, or you haven't associated your Windows desktop with that profile. If you press control+insert+S, you will open the voice profile selection dialogue, which contains two combo boxes: one for your current application and the other for your default. If you set a profile as a default, it will reappear in your current application combo box as ""use default"". But you can change this if you want to use a different profile for each application.

Stuck Jaws aand aBraille Display in Excel 2 messages,"Hi everyone,
 
Recently, I set up a Windows 10 based laptop and installed Office 365. I’m having an issue with Jaws, my Focus 40 Braille display and Excel that I hope someone can help me with.
 
When I open an excel file, I see the first cell of the sheet I’m working on but if I try to move to another cell i.e to the right, left or up or down, Jaws and the Braille display will neither speak nor will the Braille display move to the cell I want to go to. It’s basically stuck in the same cell. Are there settings I need to change/update in order to get things working properly?
 
I’m new to Windows 10 so, I would also really appreciate any tips to make Jaws and Windows 10 work properly. I prefer to use just Braille, no speech at all.
 
Thanks,
ChrisHi again everyone,
 
In regards to my original message below, had my Son check to see if the arrow keys were working when I tried to move from one cell to another and indeed they were. Jaws was not speaking the new cell nor was the Braille display displaying the new cell. If I move to another cell, than alt-tab away from and back into Excel, that new cell will be displayed but am still not able to get Jaws to speak/display another cell if I moved to it in the sheet. Just wanted to give a quick update and any suggestions for solving this issue would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks again,

"Sudden gibberish in ""say all"" with JAWS and Chrome 13 messages","I’ve made no changes overnight to my system, and yet this morning, all of a sudden, JAWS has started interrupting “say all” with frequent bursts of gibberish. For example, it just now verbalized “617 s p a c e” before resuming reading regular text. When I quote a phrase like that, it might not seem like much, but these interruptions are very distracting, in part because it takes me several listens to interpret what’s being said.
 
I first experienced it today on the New York Times website and figured the Times had made yet one more accessibility-challenging website update. However, it’s happening on the second website I’ve visited, one that requires a password to enter.
 
I’m using the latest release of JAWS 2019 along with Windows 10 and, again, Chrome. I’ve rebooted twice to make sure all applications are in synch.
 
My workaround is to copy Website text to Notepad, but I don’t want to have to take this extra step every time.
 
Anyone else encountering this annoyance?e only thing I've seen but I guess it's a youtube thing where it reads or says a whole bunch of numbers before saying the name of the vid. Now though it's auto reading a bunch of what vids are next. Oh whilst we are on this JAWS still says a load of stuff as you hit the like button and still there's no way of knowing if you've liked a vid or not. Yes you can look at the number under the button but I fortet things so it was easyer when with IE JAWS just said unlike if you already had liked the vid. So that's the strangeness I've seen with JAWS. Thanks be on to God not this kind of stuff. Hope it gets fixed.I haven't, but you could try using the sites with FireFox and use F9 to put it in reader mode.
If Chrome has a reader mode, I would like to know how to invoke it.
GlennHi Adrian,
 
I tried two sites just now. One was the National Institutes of Health and the other was the New York Times. I don’t have a subscription to the times so I don’t know if that would actually make a difference. I didn’t have your problem in read all. I am using the latest version of JAWS with Chrome Version 76.0.3809.100 but with Windows 10 1803. (My computer has not asked me to update windows, and I haven’t taken the time to do it.
 
I can only think of two things. Is the screen maximized and is there any chance that JAWS graphics announcements got changed?
 
Sorry I can’t think of more help! Good luck!
 
DebbyHi, Debby.
 
Clever of you to think of graphics. Unfortunately, I’ve just gone through my various graphics settings, and they were set at default, where I’d left them. As for maximization, I have chrome to open maximized by default.
 
Thanks for giving this some thought. NO apologies called for.Apparently, chrome is *getting* a reader mode, at least according to an article I found from April of this year. Until then though, you may be able to find an extension to do this. Someone who uses Chrome more than I do (I’m 90% a firefox user still) might want to chime in.
 Not me, so far, but I wonder, is this only happening with ‘say all”?
Say all is something I hardly ever use unless I walk away from the computer and just have my bluetooth headphones on. It may seem anitquated or slow but I normally just arrow through. Now that I have my braille display I just advance at leisure. Anyway, not suggesting you do this, but I was just wondering if, when you focus on individual lines, the extra stuff is still read. Maybe you could copy out some of these lines so we can see what the gibberish actually looks like? That might help.
 It occurs only in ‘say all.” Unfortunately, since the problem occurs only in “say all,” I can’t copy a line to demonstrate. But the example I gave of a number followed by the five letters in “space” should give you an idea.
 
The guy I spoke to at FS on Tuesday said he would escalate the issue, but when I called this afternoon, there was no record of his having done so. It got worse at FS today, as I’ll detail in a post tomorrow.I don’t really understand the fascination with reader mode. It gets grumpy when you interrupt to check you’ve heard something right, you can’t go back and forth between windows, and clicking on a link within an article disrupts it. Reader mode is for sitting back and passively listening.
 How do you turn this new reader mode on even? This is the first I hear of it.

Apparently, chrome is *getting* a reader mode, at least according to an article I found from April of this year. Until then though, you may be able to find an extension to do this. Someone who uses Chrome more than I do (I’m 90% a firefox user still) might want to chime in.

I haven't, but you could try using the sites with FireFox and use F9 to put it in reader mode.
If Chrome has a reader mode, I would like to know how to invoke it.

Subject: [jaws-users] Sudden gibberish in ""say all"" with JAWS and Chrome
 
I’ve made no changes overnight to my system, and yet this morning, all of a sudden, JAWS has started interrupting “say all” with frequent bursts of gibberish. For example, it just now verbalized “617 s p a c e” before resuming reading regular text. When I quote a phrase like that, it might not seem like much, but these interruptions are very distracting, in part because it takes me several listens to interpret what’s being said.
 
I first experienced it today on the New York Times website and figured the Times had made yet one more accessibility-challenging website update. However, it’s happening on the second website I’ve visited, one that requires a password to enter.
 
I’m using the latest release of JAWS 2019 along with Windows 10 and, again, Chrome. I’ve rebooted twice to make sure all applications are in synch.
 
My workaround is to copy Website text to Notepad, but I don’t want to have to take this extra step every time.
 
Anyone else encountering this annoyance?F9 in firefox.
Unless I’m mistaken, Chrome doesn’t have one built-in, yet, at least not in the desktop version, but it’s coming. I believe there’s at least one extension for it though that I’ve seen people talka bout here or elsewhere.
 I don’t know about a fascination, but it’s good for removing the clutter from articles, particularly on certain sites. Yes, it’s for passive reading, not clicking around on the  web – I don’t think it was ever intended to be used constantly.
 Yeah, that’s unfortunate – I really don’t know and don’t think I’ve ever experienced this. I’m only an occasional Chrome user, still.

System Tray question 2 messages,"Hi,
I rely on a few icons in my system tray for programs I minimize during the day, just as JAWS, our instant messaging client, our VPN software, and checking status of an active network connection.   Can someone explain to me how the order of these icons is determined?  The order  sometimes fluctuates and I’m wondering why.  I can understand one not being there if it’s not currently running, but one that is usually the left most icon might suddenly become the right most icon in the row.  Can I lock them in a certain order? 
 
Also, sometimes  when I use Windows B, then arrow left or right to get to the icon I need but before I can hit enter or applications key on the icon, focus will jump to a different one.  Just thought I’d ask here if others experience this before I add it to my list of Microsoft Accessibility questions.

I believe you're running Windows 10, and if so below are the steps I use to arrange the system tray icons in the order I want them.
 
I just learned that the Badges option needs to be turned off in order to 
rearrange the System Tray icons and here are my corrected steps:
Settings and their state:
Lock the Taskbar button, On.
 
The next several options I have Unchecked / Off.
 
Taskbar location on screen Combo box, Bottom
 
Taskbar location on screen Combine taskbar buttons, Never
 
Here's how I rearrange the system tray icons  running Windows 10 Pro Version 
1809 (OS Build 17763.379) & all installed versions of Jaws.
1. Windows key + I, for Settings, tab 1 time to System, right arrow to 
Personalization, and press enter.
2. Navigate to, Taskbar and press enter.
3. Tab several times to, Show Badges on Taskbar..., and make sure this is, 
Off / unchecked.
4. Tab a few times to, Notification Area, Select which icons appear on the 
taskbar Link, and press enter.
5. Okay now to put the System Tray in the order you want it in.  Tab through 
all the icons making a note of which ones you have checked / turned on 
because you're going to uncheck all of them.
6. Uncheck all the icons.  Now you will go through and check the icons in 
the order you want them in but keep in mind, they will appear in the reverse 
order that they are checked.  What I mean is, the 1st one yu check will be 
at the bottom of the list, the 2nd will be 2nd from the bottom, the 3rd will 
be 3rd from the bottom etc. etc....  After you're done open the system tray 
to make sure it's the way you want it and Alt + F4 if it is.
 
Note:  With the System Tray now arranged the way you want it, you can now 
turn, Badges, on if you prefer this setting to be on.

Tabs on web Pages 10 messages,"I am noticing that more and more web pages are using tabs on the page to organize their content. For example, a restaurant menu web page may have tabs for breakfast, lunch items, etc.  When I hit ENTER or the spacebar to access a tab, I find that i can't read any of the items within the tab, or navigate within the tab.  What keystrokes do I need to use to work with these tabs?
 
AndyHi Andy,
 
When I press enter on a Tab I get the same sound as I get when I open an edit field, so I press the PC cursor key to close the so called edit field and
then I can arrow or tab through the options.  You can also try a left mouse click on the tabs.

If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!I haven't seen them as tabs as much as closed menus
If you press space bar, that opens that.
I wonder if that is the same thing you mentioned.
To me, tabs are like separate pages that you control + tab to.
 
GlennI’ve seen “tabs” on wirecutter.com. It’s a New York times website that reviews tech-related stuff. For example, in Best Travel Gear, if you click on that, it opens into a web page with tabs: packing, just in case, etc. I’ve never figured out how to open those tabs.
 I wrestled with those New York Times tabs yesterday when I couldn’t get the “All comments” tab to highlight. Finally, I switched from Chrome to IE11, where the tabs show up as links. As links, they work.What is the PC curser key please?
 Put your hand on the top right of your numpad. 
 
the first button is the jaws cursor. 
 
The second button, one below that, is about twice as long.  That, is your PC key.
 
JustinMany thanks for this. Another ask! I see the example of accessing tabs, but when else might one find the Jaws key useful?
AlisonHi, Alison.
 
Terminology can be confusing. On this list, when people refer to the “JAWS key,” they’re typically using shorthand for the insert key on the desktop layout and the caps lock on the laptop layout. I think you’re asking here about the JAWS cursor key, the one above the PC cursor key that Justin explained.
 
The JAWS cursor sometimes enables you to read parts of the screen that you can’t access in the normal PC cursor mode. As listers have been saying more often lately, it doesn’t help as often as it used to, but sometimes it still can. If you find yourself wondering about a particular webpage or screen, press the JAWS cursor key, then press control-home to go to the top of the screen, then press “say all.” See if JAWS picks up any additional information. To bring back the PC cursor, just press that PC cursor key.Hi,
Typically when I encounter tabs on a web page, I press enter to activate the tab then enter again to exit forms mode then I can tab into the open tab.

I am new to this list and, though I’m not new to JAWS, I have some seemingly novice questions.
I need to make the choice between a Mac with VoiceOve ror a PC with Windows 10 and JAWS. Background: have used PCs with JAWS ever since 2002, but had been waiting for approval from my health insurance to get a new JAWS version ever since late 2017. In the meantime, last January, I bought a Mac, which I can’t get used to. Long story short, I was finally approved for JAWS and now my husband is willing to get me a Windows PC and to take over my Mac. Keeping both the Mac and PC is not an option for practical reasons.

As the purchase of the Mac was quite a desperate action and I don’t want to repeat it, I want to get opinions from people as to how useable JAWS is these days. Is there a browser that works well? I cannot get used to the way Safari works on the Mac, but I don’t want to have to have three different browsers on my PC like I did with my last Windows PC and way old JAWS. What about Windows Mail? Is the Windows app store accessible nowadays, and if not, where do you get your apps?

Is there a way to keep files synchronized between PC and iPhone? I like my iPhone and really use it all the time.

What feed reader(s) is/are accessible with JAWS? Is Kindle for PC still accessible (Kindle for Mac isn’t)? Just some random questions. Will ask more if I think of any.

http://astridetal.wordpress.com/Hi Astrid,
I think for the best experience with browsers, folks will do best with two or three of them, at least Chrome and FireFox.
IE is working less and less with web content.
The good news on browsers, is that they all react pretty much the same with the same screenreader, so once your settings are as you like them, all the key combinations are the same.
About the biggest difference is in browsers other than IE, you press control L instead of control O for opening a link that you type in, and in FF, you have bookmarks instead of favorites, so it is alt + B instead of alt + A.
And in Chrome, if you do control L, and type in the name of the bookmark, it will auto-fill it for you.
Unfortunately accessibility is still fleeting with the Internet.
That should answer one of your many questions at least.
GlennHi Glenn,
Thanks so much.

How true that statement is plus a lot of web sited have grapics and some screen readers don’t read them correctly

I appreciate your friendship/support at:
https://www.gofundme.com/sugars-transplant-journey
-SugarFirst, you are going to need to be a bit flexible.
 
With Windows 10, Google Chrome is a good browser; and although it is not recommended by information technology experts because of some security risks, Internet Explorer 11 is also quite accessible.
The IE replacement, the Edge browser, is decently accessible with the latest version of Jaws; but that browser is evolving and will be eventually part of the Chromium experience
https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-is-microsofts-chromium-based-edge-really-different-from-chrome/
 
Flexibility though may be necessary; there are some instances where you may encounter a website that doesn't perform well with one browser, but will with another.  That may also apply to screen-readers; there may be a few instances when Jaws will not cooperate but a competitive screen-reader will, and vice versa.
 
I'm not a fan of Windows Mail, maybe it works better for others, but I never was happy with it.  A lot of folks use Thunderbird; I use Outlook Express, but that is a more complex story than what you apparently want to deal with.
 
You can use the Microsoft App Store, but I haven't found it necessary; there are plenty of places to get different programs to perform the functions that one needs in Windows 10 without using their store.
 
As for feed discovery, you can monitor those in IE and Google Chrome; I am sure Firefox has that capability also, but I only use an older version of Firefox on a limited basis for its Captcha solving plug-in.
 
Yes, there are ways to move data between your Windows 10 PC and the iPhone.  See
https://www.easeus.com/iphone-data-transfer/transfer-files-to-ipad-iphone.html
 
And, you can set up syncing capabilities, althoough you will find the easiest way by downloading the Microsoft Phone companion from that dreaded app store. See
https://www.itprotoday.com/windows-server/sync-your-windows-10-pc-your-iphone-ipad-or-android-device
 
Yes, the Kindle is accessible with Jaws.  As a matter of fact, I think that was referenced in one of the recent updates to Jaws 19.
SteveThanks so very. much. I think I’ll do fine using Chrome and Firefox then. As for feed readers, I guess I’m going to look into online ones, as the Thunderbird add-on doesn’t seem to have the organizing capabilities I want. I follow like several hundreds of blogs.

Regarding browsers, I find that the latest versions of both Chrome and Firefox work well with recent versions of JAWS. IE also still works well from my experience in most cases. (It's still my default browser.)

I use Thunderbird for email and love it. It's quite accessible with JAWS.

If you like your iPhone (as I like mine) you might find that some things are even easier on the iPhone than on the PC. For instance, I use the iOS Facebook app even though the mobile Facebook site is accessible. The Kindle app on the iPhone is accessible as is the Audible app and the BARD app if you have access to BARD.

There are several podcast apps for the iPhone that are quite accessible and popular. And you might want to try Lire for your blogs.

Many people like iPhone apps for Twitter, but I greatly prefer TWBlue on my Windows 10 computer.

As far as syncing files between Windows and iOS is concerned, Dropbox works quite well for this. You can also use Google Drive or OneDrive from Microsoft. I understand you can use iCloud even now, but I haven't done this myself. And as of iOS 13 being released this fall, it definitely should work even better with the new updated Files app.

I'd be willing to bet that you will find Windows 10 with JAWS to be a much more pleasant experience than you had with your mac. Good luck.

JeffI just now tried signing up for a newsletter from a web site I heard on Coast To Coast with Internet Explorer, and I tried to do the audio challenge, and I got a message back stating that my computer appears to be sending automated queries and to try back later.
This has happened before with IE.
So I did alt + D and control C to copy the URL, and opened the page in FireFox, and everything worked well with FF.
This is but one example where we need to have multiple browsers at hand.
 
GlennHi all! Sometimes, some websites work better with Firefox and other websites only work with Chrome.

Sent from my Gmail EmailThanks so much for answering my questions. Yes, I used to use Lire on my iPhone and a web-based feed reader on Windows. I never found a good web-based reader that I liked though. Now I use News Explorer on both my iPhone and Mac, because it syncs very easily. That’s the only thing keeping me from deciding I want a Windows PC, because I use feed readers really all the time.

Two In One Laptops 3 messages,"Hi,
 
I am considering getting a new laptop and have heard of Two In One machines, which operate as both a conventional laptop, but can also fold over, to be a tablet.
 
Has anyone experience of using such machines with JAWS? I am especially interested in how the touch screen experience might be with JAWS. I use an Apple IPhone and am aware of swipes and other gestures on that. Would it be a similar experience if I was using a Two In One laptop in tablet mode?
 
Finally, if any of you use such machines, which brands or models would you recommend? I require a new machine, to do a lot of Microsoft Office work, surfing the net, email etc.
 
Many Thanks

Two questions related to Skype audio,"Hi guys,  as in subject I have 2 questions concerning audio Skype, one is for myself and one for a friend of mine.

My problem is, if I am on a call and I am listening to something with my external Logitech headphones, people tell me they hear me bad, as if my voice is not clear and they don't hear every word I say. My friend instead has a problem in her iPad, basically when she sends me voice messages with her Skype for iPad I hear her volume really low. I need suggestions for both problems, even if for the first one a friend of mine says it's a sort of Skype bug in Windows when using external devices.

I encountered two distressing problems with your phone tech support this week. I explained the underlying JAWS defect in my preceding email. The gist is that JAWS has suddenly started interspersing gibberish when I use “say all’ with Chrome on webpages. Here, I I’m hoping I can help spare other JAWS users the experiences I had with tech support.
 
On Tuesday afternoon, I called for assistance. X listened to my explanation and immediately said he would have the problem escalated. I waited until Friday without getting any follow-up, and so I called again around six o’clock. Z told me he could find no escalation report. That’s one issue. I was a waiting in vain for action that was never going to be taken.
 
The second issue is far more serious. Unlike X, Z made an attempt to solve the problem. After connecting into my system, he determined that my Intel video driver needed updating, which he did. Unfortunately, it didn’t solve the problem. So he continued to investigate.
 
At some point, our call got disconnected. I sat at my phone and PC for at least ten minutes, not wanting to interrupt Z’s concentration. Finally I said “Hello,” and on getting no response, I realized we’d lost the connection. I then went to my PC and saw that he’d written a message on Notepad asking me to call back.
 
By now it was approaching seven o’clock, and I had a social commitment. I finished getting ready before calling back, only to learn at 7:02 that Vispero shuts down at seven.
 
At this point, I discovered that something was very wrong with my system. Whatever Z had been working on was unfinished, but I couldn’t figure out what he’d been doing. JAWS gave me no information. (Later experience, as you’ll see, makes me think Narrator might have been more help.) I took a risk and rebooted. Thankfully, the computer came back up, but with no speech. I turned on Narrator, at which point I found references to Intel, graphics drivers and some features of the Ease of Access Center. As Narrator spoke, JAWS also suddenly started speaking. I closed Narrator and tried to get JAWS to read what was on the screen, but with no luck. It verbalized only items on the desktop. I tried to restart Narrator, but it wouldn’t come up.
 
I then attempted to use JAWS to work with email and other programs, but it acted weirdly. Afraid to reboot again, I called my tech support person who said he would get back to me later that night, which suited us both. We got back in touch around 10:30. By midnight, he’d restored my system to the previous restore point, August 9, and began solving various new problems associated with the restore process. For my part, I had to update JAWS again. More work was done this morning, and yet more will be done on Monday.
 
Here’s what I can’t understand. Z clearly wishes to be helpful, and I believe he is more than competent. However, he left my computer in an exposed, risky state. Although it turns out he’d asked me to call back, he didn’t warn me that Vispero would be closing in less than ten minutes. In fact, he still had access to my system: that connection wasn’t broken. He could at least have completed what he was working on or, failing that, closed up the items he’d opened.
 
Also, he could have called me. My phone number is surely in your system because I’ve been asked for it in the past. He had my name and license number and could have looked it up.
 
This is going to be a costly repair job for me thanks to Vispero’s tech support. More than that, if I didn’t have such a conscientious tech person available, things could have got out of hand. I’m reasonably competent with JAWS and I have some understanding of computers, but I’m no techy. My expertise is in other areas. As it is, I spent late last night fixing things with my tech guy, then another hour until one o’clock fixing things on my own, only to resume with my tech guy this morning. It has been very disruptive.
 
Vispero must train its support staff never to leave a customer in the lurch like this. I’ve had good and bad experiences with JAWS support over the years. Frankly, the bad ones had made me apprehensive about calling again, even though when the experiences were good, they were very good. Now I’m apprehensive all over again. I’m hoping this matter can now be resolved through email and without having a Vispero employee connecting to my system. But above all, I’m hoping Vispero will assure me and other JAWS users that something like this will never occur again.
 
I’m going to post a version of this complaint, minus individual names, on the JAWS list I subscribe to. People need to know how to safeguard themselves against irresponsible actions by tech support staff.
 
Please advise.
 
Adrian SprattI have to be very blunt about your experience.?? Yes, Vispero could have done a better job.?? But as a blind consumer, you also have a responsibility.?? You should never call customer support for Vispero or any other company when it is close to quitting time, which is normally 5:00 PM or 6:00 PM local time.?? Always call earlier in the day, preferably when they open.?? If this is not convenient, then find a way to make the time.?? I can't tell you how many times I have been disconnected from a customer support agent only to call back and discover that the company had closed for the day, or else all the agents had gone out to lunch, which, for most [companies, is usually between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM local time, another period which should be avoided.?? 



Gerald A company cannot leave a customer in the lurch like that.I agree, the job does not end at 5PM if the job isn't done.
GlennOh yes they can!!?? When it's quitting time or lunch time, they walk out the door.?? They don't care about leaving a customer in the lurch.?? It's not just Vispero.?? Even large companies like Verizon have customer support agents who simply disconnect the customer in the middle of a call because the clock has struck 5:00 PM or else they are experiencing a Big Mac attack and need to rush out to McDonald's for lunch.



Gerald I agree. This need to be address.Well is looks like it does with jaws. When I worked as a social worker, if I had a call from a clientand it was getting to 4:00 PM (I worked from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM) I address the issue with my client and if it look like it was going to take more time I let the client know I will call the next day. I did help when it was an emergency.   
 I know very little about technology and certainly, not a whole lot about Jaws. But what I do know is that the company which now produces Jaws and provides technical support, like so many other companies, has grown and merged with other companies; that its organization is now a lot more complicated than it once was, and that, inevitably its connection to blind users in the US is more impersonal and fragmented than it used to be. Because I’m old, I’ve seen this change take place in all of the systems of which we are a part. Size, bureaucracy, and focus on the largest possible profit, are to blame.
 
MiriamWith all due respect, I must agree with Adrian here.
 
Although it’s always good to avoid calling tech support near the end of their working hours, some of us have very busy schedules, and simply can’t call at any time of the day.  If someone is working during normal business hours, they simply might not be able to put everything on hold while technicians try to solve a problem.  I remember these sorts of issues very well when I was in my University teaching and administrative positions.
 
Dr.  Tom Behler from MichiganSeveral months I have issues with my Windows but when I call Microsoft, they help and it took several hours. They did not just say it was 5:00 PM and ended the call.   
 Tom yes. However those of us who work and had problem that someone needed help we did not just tell them call me tomorrow. If I could not address the problem, I made a point of calling the person ASAP. This has to do with respect and following through.Quite so, especially, when the tech chap knew jolly well the issue and had all the customer details to hand.
 
I usually do not jump into these discussions but this is an issue of fundamental importance. We talk about inclusion, disability equality, legal and moral obligations etc. but such concepts are mere ideals if staff of a specialist company who make their living out of selling products to vi people can’t be bothered about their business, legal and moral obligations.
 
 
 
Many Thanks
 
 
Waqas H. ChauhdryIf all that has issues with Freedom Scientific/ Vispero. I can tell you from first hand experience. That is go to the web site and find the area related to quality of service. It has been a while since I’ve been there to rate now, Vispero. Yet, Something close to this happen to me a while back. I was so mad I went to the Web-site and kept looking till.. To which I clearly stated the issue. To whom I had spoken with and .. I was not expecting to hear except I did and a Gentleman told me whom he was and.. So, Please find that spot on the web-site and tell your story in full with the names involved and I’ll bet you will see.. Gene/Geno
 Really any jaws issues could first be solved by performing a jaws repair! 
Make sure the jaws executable is in your downloads folder, then just launch it as if you are doing a jaws update.  If the executable is the same version as the one you are currently running, once youlaunch it jaws will automatically do a repair.  At least that’s what happened on my computer.
 
E-mail is golden!!!
Kevin LeeI also had less-than-stellar tech support this past week from a support person who, to my knowledge, gave me misinformation, and I confirmed this through trial and error and other sources.  Very disappointed.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”
 One consideration, although not justifiable to the customer with the problem is that many of the blind workers wherever, catch mass transit that won’t wait.  Someone driving a car can afford to get on the road when convenient for them, not so necessarily when taking mass transit.

Unmute and refresh screen commands can't be separated,"This is an update on a thread from last week.
 
the key combination JAWS key+escape has two unrelated functions. If you have sound muted, it will unmute it. Unfortunately, it will also refresh the screen, a function I use a lot. When I refresh the screen and have sound muted, the keystroke also brings back the sound, whether or not I want it to.
 
When I reported this problem here, it was suggested that I change the key assignment. The idea made sense, but it turns out it can’t be done. So I wrote to Vispero. Here’s what they said in reply:
 
The JAWS® 2019 program has added the Unmute feature to the Refresh Screen script. The only way these two functions can be separated would be to rewrite the Refresh Screen script. If you would like to see this feature considered for a future update of JAWS, you should send a messages to suggestions@... for consideration.
 
Yes, I have written to Vispero. I hope others who have experienced this annoyance will do so also.

Updates for Microsoft Lync and Skype For Business (SFB) JAWS scripts,"This message concerns the commercial-grade Lync and Skype For Business products, not the consumer-grade Skype products.

Due to a number of folks needing support for older Skype for Business and Microsoft Lync versions, I have spent a fair amount of time setting up three separate script sets for these products. I have no way to test any except
the first one below though, so I would greatly appreciate it if those who run older product versions could help me make sure that I have coded and named these sets correctly.
For example, I'm not sure what product names Microsoft has used (e.g., was there a product called Skype For Business 2015, or just 2016?).

All of these sets can easily be reached from one URL: https://www.dlee.org/sfb/

Here are the sets, with their specific addresses even though they can be reached from the above URL:

Scripts for Skype For Business (SFB) for Office 365: https://www.dlee.org/sfb/365/

Scripts for Skype For Business (SFB) 2016: https://www.dlee.org/sfb/16/

Updating the situation of my friend,"Hi guys,

I just ended a Tandem session with my friend about whom I talked some days ago. The scripts are now working perfectly, so apparently Doug had right in saying that restarting JAWS was sufficient. I also changed the Skype command key because in Italian we need the default key for a character, which we use for the verb corresponding to ""is"". The problem is that I was not able to follow the directions that Sarah gave me about adding the desktop icon, since on the context menu there's no ""create shortcut"" item. Two possible doubts that came to my mind. One is, I used applications instead of shift+f10; does it make any difference? Secondly, she apparently did not install programs like OpenShell, do you think it's necessary? I installed that utility on my machine, and effectively I could find ""Create shortcut"" option on another app.

Bye!

Using Insert F10 instead of Alt Tabbing 8 messages,"Hi,
I recently learned about using Insert F10 to switch between programs.  This seems like it will be helpful when I have a lot open and alt tabbing would take longer.  What I’m curious about is stuff showing up in this view that I don’t know about and seems like it adds clutter.  I’m on a company laptop, so I’m guessing this is extra stuff my company is running in the background, but I’m wondering if this is similar to what others see.   Here is an example:
 
I’m in Windows 10 with JAWS 2019.  The only programs I have launched are JAWS and my Outlook inbox.  Alt Tabbing only shows my desktop and the inbox, since I have JAWS running in the system tray.  When I press Insert F10, this is what I get.

send an e-mail to mailto:DNERequests@... with 'No Promotional E-mails' in the SUBJECT line.Alt tab cycles you through open apps. Like word, outlook, etc.
 
Insert f10 opens the list of applications running on your device, i.e.  pointing device, outlook, a message if open, and other devices like in your case Bluetooth devices and there seems to be 2 of those running on your device.Instead of pressing alt-tab if you have more than two programs open,
Press windows key-tab.
You will be in a list of running apps in which you can press the left and right arrow keys to go from one to another.  When you find what you want, just press enter to select it.  If instead you want to close a program, when you find it, press the context menu key and arrow down to close and press enter.
Windows-t will put you on the taskbar, but this will give you all programs you’ve pinned there as well as running programs.  Again, use the left and right arrow keys to navigate.  I suspect some of that is stuff either windows or your company has running in the background.Thanks, Rebecca.  I’ll play with your suggested approach.  I liked the list box view of the F10 route, but as the day goes on, I see other background apps filling in that list.The Cisco Jabber client leaves this HubWindowPlugin.dll in the insert+f10 list.

Thanks, Chris.  Wish it was named something more obvious, but I can now see how you can open that navigate to the Jabber main window.Hi Robin;
Most of that stuff you can alt f4 out of without doing any damage. For example: Synaptics Pointing Device Driver you can turn that off and your touchpad will remain on. When I first started using win10 this and other programs that were loaded at startup kept showing up in this list.

Using unicode emojis? 8 messages,"Hello,
 
I would like to know how to employ these.
 
I use the image ones you can paste, but not sure what to do with the Unicode ones.
 
They look like numbers and not an image, at least this is the way Jaws reads them, and not understanding how a group of digits, when typed out, don’t look like a group of digits, instead of an image.
 
Thanks for educating me.
 
I also should learn when and when not to use them.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Hi.
 
Well, not 100% certain I understand the query, but unicode characters are defined by number codes. So you can input them into yoru documents by typing the number of the code, selecting it, and then hitting alt-x. The nubmers should be replaced by whatever character is desired … which could include a small image.
This doesn’t work in all contexts, only in Microsoft Office, I believe, but a lot of programmes will recognise unicode values.
 You answered my questions exactly, and thanks.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”
 Cool!
Have fun with all the silly ✗ ∳☖ ⤗☘✙
 Can you tell me where I can go, online, to get a list of these, I have a website for the alt codes already. Thanks.
 Hey jerry.
 
It’s surprisingly difficult to find a *complete* list online. I think this is because there are over 100,000 characters, all told, and they may not all display correctly on all systems.
 
Try this, for starters:
https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTips/unicode-symbols.html
 
and the wikipedia, which has many links and references:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters
 
 
An important thing to note is that unicode values are entered in hexidecimal numbers, so they can also include the letters a to f.
 
Still searching for the most complete list available online.

WLM Filters 26 messages,"Hi,
I'm having difficulty creating a filter in Windows Live Mail.
I have several that I have made, so I normally have no problem creating filters.
The criteria that does not seem to be working is
""where the message body contains""
The only two things that are available when I go into it to type in the filter is exact match or any of the criteria.
But there should be an edit field to type in something for it to filter.
There is only those two options, and neither givbes me an edit field.
I've used my Jaws cursor, to look for something to click on, and there is nothing that I can find to click on.  latest Jaws, and this is Windows 7-64.
I have done this before in OE and it allows me to put in some criteria.
Something else strange I noticed, it reads ""checked"" when it shows other filters and also in some of the options.
If anyone here is using WLM and has figured this one out, I'll write a Thanks in advance for any thoughts.
GlennGlen, are you talking about the third roll over in the four rolls?
What I normally do is this.
after doing a alt n for new rule, the first roll I go down to to and cc, but you could get away with just to.
That’s a personal preference.
Tab once to the second roll and you should see move to the specified folder and it should be checked.
The third is probably where you’re having problems.
    I usually skip this one and fill in the name I want the rule to be named first which is the four roll then back tab to the third.
Smack enter on it and you should see a field to inter in the address.
Then if you smack enter twice, you then should see move it to the folder you want to move it to.
Hope this helps.
Ron KR3DOG-PA-WCECTM
 Hi Ron,
Actually, there is only a problem with using
where the message body contains
I used the from field as well, as I'm filtering messages from a specific sender and having it moved to a specific folder.
The sender also sends messages that I don't want in that folder, so the part of the filter that should allow me to put in something specific gives me no edit field to do so.
I've made many filters in the past, and this one is an odd issue.
Hope I was able to explain it better.
 
GlennRon and All,
Just thought I'd let the list know that I figured out a work-around for the message body not having an edit field in the filter.
I tried not checking the from option, and only selecting the message body and the move to a folder options, and when there was only one option, I got an edit field to put in my criteria.
Then I saved that part, and then I shift tabbed up and added the from option and did that part, and then the rest of the filter worked as usual.
I don't know why that would matter, but this way worked.
 
GlennAre you in the states? don’t know what else to tell you.
Write me off list and if you’re in the states ship me your phone number and times zone and I’ll try my best to help you out.
RonThis is good news.
But when you say from, do you mean the to field?
Because I have my first Colum set to to and cc, then the second Colum to move to checked as well.
If you’d like you also can have the first Colum set to just to as well.
As you know, all four columns are personal preferences on how you’d like thing to be set up.
Glad you figured it out.
Ron who’s still trying to figure out why when he ships out a letter that he wrote the tag lines goes out with WLM, but if I ctrl and or fw a letter the tag line needs to be typed in by hand then I can ship out the letter with the tagline where it should be within the letter.
 Ron,
Is what you are calling a tagline the signature?
I've never heard it referred to in an eMail as a tagline.
In the settings, it's called a signature, and that is in settings.
It has a tab (page) of its own.
You can set it to go with forwards and replies there.
By default, signatures only go out on original messages.
GlennGlad you found this solution because I may have occasion to want to do the same kind of filter. I believe I did have one, once, long ago but had certainly forgotten how to make it work.Thanks for sharing.
MarieHi back at you Glen.
Yes, I’m calling the signature a tag line.
I can’t believe you’ve never ever heard of that my friend.
Glad to hear that you solve your problem though.

In the good old days of Morse code Shorthand, 73's AKA Best Regards and or Best Whishes,
From Ron U.S. Ham Radio Station KR3DOG-PA-WCECTM
Pennsylvania West County Emergency Com-Tree ManagerRon I appreciate this offer. I have been using WLM since it was conceived and set up multiple filters. I just seldom use more than one criteria for sorting.
MarieThat’s a little tricky to do over the phone, and the sound effect would be for all mail not just for the inbox.
Sorry that I can’t be more help.
RonRon,
Have you ever noticed inconsistencies in the mail filters in WLM?
I have one that filters anything sent to audiotrax into my media folder.
99% of the time it works, but once in a while one slips through into my inbox.
I had the same filters, made just the same in outlook express, and they always worked as expected.
Glennyes, I do notice that once in a blue moon that a few will go into the inbox instead of where they’re suppose to go into.
I usually double check  the rule AKA filter and go down into the rules and click on modify and double check that everything is set correctly.
But you can’t help that a few will go astray.
Enjoy the rules filter feature and the sub mailbox feature in WLM.
Every time I need to talk to a MS disability operator, while we’re linked together, I’ll recommend those two features and why I know quite of few blind people are using the MS mail app, why I’m staying with WLM and keep asking if they’ll install the two above features into the mail app.
Unless something seriously  happens to WLM or if they finely get all of the bugs out of the mail app, I’m staying with WLM.
Enjoy.
RonA lot of times what happens is that a message is sent to multiple addresses at the same time and the filters seem to get a bit confused as to where to put them so they go to the inbox.
 
DannyMaybe that is why lists don't like people to cross-post.
GlennHi Ron,
I have a weird eMail thing going on, and I'm wondering if a friend's Comcast server is rejecting messages from a WLM client.
Can you send a message to a friend's address and see if he gets it?
If you copy this message from me he will understand, as I've been working with him and Comcast on the phone today, and this is a hypothesis I just came up with.
If he gets a message from you, using WLM, then we'll know that it isn't because Comcast is rejecting WLM messages.
His address is:
josephmachise@...
Thanks.
GlennSorry list, I thought I was responding to Ron privately.
GlennI know you meant this to go directly to Ron, but I can assure you that ComCast is not rejecting emails from WLM.

Using JAWS 2018, Current version of WLM, and Windows 10 on a Dell laptop, can anyone tell me if there is a way to search for a specific email message from a specific contact? Any information will be appreciated. Thanks.
 
JerryJerry,
Do shift + control + F
for Find
Press alt + R which will take you to the from field
You don't have to use the entire eMail address, just enough to find the one you want.
If I were looking for a message from you, I would just put jyand in the from field
If I had a lot of your messages saved, I'd put something in the message body to isolate that, like if you had sent a message on cassette tapes, I would write tape in the message.
The message body is alt + A
Alt + I will start the search, but usually you can just press enter in any field.
HTH.
Glennalternately you can use f4 and tab through some options until you hear find and hit space bar
good luckIs there a reason you aren’t using the find command, then inputting the e-mail address in the from field?

Web site shortcuts on desktop. 9 messages,"Hello, All,
 
I’ve recently updated to Jaws 19, although my issue may not have anything to do with that.
 
I also had problems with Google Chrome crashing, so I restored the settings, as had been suggested in a help forum.
 
Now, however, any of the shortcuts on my desktop to sites just take me to the main Google Chrome page.
 
I have tried deleting and creating new shortcuts, but no changes.  I also tried checking the checkbox on the shortcut creation dialogue that says to open in a window, still no changes.
 
I’ve tried the various On Startup checkboxes, still no changes.
 
Does anyone have ideas for me?  As it is now, I have to type in the total url and can no longer use shortcuts.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Good morning;
perhaps you can give the steps you take to create a web desktop shortcut. I just created one in chrome, and had no problem using the shortcut to get to the web page.
 
 
 
       The impossible is the untried,  Never under estimate the power of a dream.
 Hi, David,
 
The steps I tried are as follows:
 
When on the site for which I want to create the shortcut, I went into Chrome settings, More Tools, Create Shortcut.   I hit enter and hit enter again, so that the shortcut would appear on my desktop.
 
I’ve only been on Google Chrome, maybe about a year, but I started having issues with Chrome crashing, which was happening with more frequency, so I reset the settings.
 
It has been since I reset the settings that I have had this problem.
 
I also would like to ask you which checkbox is checked in your Startup settings, just to make sure I have things correct.
 
Since my original installation of Chrome, Jaws has updated, Chrome has updated, and Windows has updated, so I am wondering if any of these updates are affecting this ability to create proper shortcuts that don’t always default to Google Chrome.
 
In addition, I also found some information on a forum where this can be an issue, so I am not the only one facing this.
https://forums.techguy.org/threads/every-chrome-desktop-shortcut-goes-to-googles-homepage-now.1199607/
 
I have also created a case with Google, and haven’t heard back yet.
 
Thanks again.

 Would you please give the steps you used in Chrome to create a web page desktop icon?
 
Sincerely, Vicky V
 Hi, Vicky,
 
While on the web page for which I want to make the shortcut, I went into Settings, then More Tools, then entered on Add Shortcut.  I entered again to send it to the desktop.
 
This is what I usually do.  Some of my shortcuts were already there from the days when I was using Internet Explorer, and I had created some new ones with Google Chrome before.  However, this problem arose after resetting mhy Chrome settings.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”The way I do it is to copy the link in a browser, by doing alt + D and copy.
Then I make a copy of the chrome shortcut via the applications key, it will have the same name but with (2) with it.
Then I do alt + enter on that new shortcut, and in the path field, I press the end key and a space and paste
So this puts the path to chrome a space and the URL.
Then I exit and on the shortcut, I press F2 and rename it.
It was much more to explain it than it really takes to do all this.
Maybe there is a shorter way, but this is the steps Google used to offer a few years back.
GlennHi, Glenn,
 
I proceeded to try the same way you are suggesting, but did not see the shortcut option in the context menu.  The closest thing I saw is the Save Page As option, when on the page itself.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”
 If you are using W10, it may be different.
You may need to go to send to, and find desktop, create shortcut.
 Hi, Glenn,
 
You’re right, I am in Windows 10.  What you are describing is the way Internet Explorer has tocreate a shortcut.
 
What I finally have done is change my default browser back to Internet Explorer and redone the affected shortcuts.
 
What I believe happened is that, when I reset my Chrome browser settings, it defaulted my previously-created shortcuts to the Google Chrome main page.  This should not have happened, as far as I am concerned.
 
Once I recreated them all in Internet Explorer, and switched back to Chrome, all my shortcuts are back intact.
 
I just now tried and succeeded in creating another desktop shortcut in Chrome.
 
 
In retrospect, once resetting Chrome settings, if I had switched my default browser to something else, then switched back to Chrome again as my default browser, that may have been what cleared up the problem.  Not sure, but that is all I can come up with.

Weird issues with skype,"Hi everyone.

I have had a very odd issue with Skype for the last 24 hours or so.

First, nothing worked. I couldn't call anyone or message anyone. Then,
I tried to sign out and cannot sign back in. It keeps saying loading
and then returns to the sign in with this account screen. When I tried
to sign in on Skype. com, I got a message that the website timed out.

I am not sure what to do. Mind you, the only way for me to make
international calls is through Skype or Facetime and I live in Israel,
so I don't think I can call Microsoft Accessibility from here.

Any advice would be very very appreciated!

Cheers,

What is the command for toggling 8 pixels per space? 9 messages,"Hi.
 
I used to know this because I remember pressing a two=key combinati on the Seika braille display I was using at work at the time
Now I have a Focus 40 and I cannot find this toggle anywhere. I have found a few allusions to it online. I’ve tried the JAWS command search and only come up with useless results (I seriously don’t think this feature is even working properly). I’m using JAWS 2018. Any ideas?Hi,
 
I am not completely sure I understand what you are asking, but try JAWS setting center under miscellaneous. There are pixel settings in there. I know, I used to use them to adjust the spacing in the old wonderful WordPerfect.

Hope that helps!
 
DebbyI wonder if JM is referring to dots in a cell, pins that is, and not pixels on the screen.
I don't think pixels would correctly refer to Braille pins on a Braille display.
GlennYou are probably right, I wasn’t paying attention, I looked up changing between 8-dot and 6-dot braille on a Focus 40 Blue.  I found the user guide on the web by just googling “focus 40 user guide.) To switch between 6-dot and 8-dot braille use cord dots 2, 3, 6.
 
I hope that is closer to the mark!
 
DebbyHey.
 
I believe I found the same user guide. I am not looking for the six to eight dot toggle. This is a command that, as far as I know, pertains to how JAWS estimates the use of space on the braille display. It is mentioned in the braille section of the help topics, and it is advised that you can switch to “unlimited” if you have occasional issues with white space on the display. I used to know this command, in fact, on the Seika, and I can’t remember if there was an appropriate way to switch it in settings/using the JAWS menus, but I feel like there was. Although the braille section of the manual does mention this toggle, it frustratingly doesn’t actually tell you what the command is … or at least, not that I can see. I’ve looked in both the Focus manual and the list of keystrokes for this display given in the same Braille help tpics. Nothing going. I’ve used the find feature in all cases.From the braile formating topic:
 
The Toggle8PixelsPerSpace option, designed to be a convenient and efficient way to view Braille, lets you conserve space on your Braille display, so more information can be displayed at one time.
 
JAWS often has to estimate the number of spaces within a line or portion of a line, and it estimates this based on the width in pixels. One space is assumed for every eight pixels. Displaying Braille information in this manner provides you feedback on how this information is visually presented.
 
Press the Toggle 8 PixelsPerSpace key and the message ""unlimited pixels per space"" is spoken. Using the Unlimited Pixels Per Space option allows you to move up and down through the text, viewing the display without white space. Only the space and tab characters written into the document show as blank cells.
 
When 8 pixels per space is selected, each line may differ in pixel length. So using the BRAILLE UP and BRAILLE DOWN keys may not place you at the same character location as that of the preceding line.
 
You can change the setting at any time by using the toggle key. For more information, see your Braille display's help topic on the Toggle 8 Pixels Per Space keystroke.
 
Elsewhere in the braille modes section:
 
In Line Mode, JAWS provides a way for you to change how text is shown on your braille display. The default setting is 8 pixels per space. For more information on pixel space relative to white space on your braille display, see the section on braille formatting.
 
It’s this toggle that I am looking for.  I can find no reference to it ina nything specific to the Focus, so far.
 
 Hi.
Yes, that is definitely related to what I am looking for. But there is supposed to be a toggle that one can adjust with a braille display to determine how JAWS handles this. The positions are supposed to be “8 pixels” and “unlimited”. As far as I can see, the setting in the miscelaneous group is an edit box where you enter in a number, not a toggle.Hey JM,
 
I think I found it!
 
Hit Insert+F2 for the run JAWS Manager
Select the Keyboard Manager
Select Default and press Enter
Tab over to the list of commands,
Down-arrow to BrailleToggle8PixelsPerSpace and you will see that no shortcut is assigned,
Assign your own shortcut.

"When web pages load, JAWS says Blank!","Hi all,
This has been a topic on this list and on others as well.
I've seen this issue at work  in recent weeks.
I've also brought it to the attention of co-workers at FS.
The big issue is getting information about what happens when JAWS says blank.
This happens very erratically so making it happen on demand is a very difficult task.

I am not proposing that we talk about it on this list because I am interested in gathering information to feed to others to see if we can find a solution.

This happens to me with JAWS 2019, and maybe even JAWS 2018.  It happens in Windows 10 and Chrome.
Does it happen to others in other browsers?
When does it happen?  Does it happen only when pages are loading or when other applications are open as well?
Please send answers to me off list and maybe we can find a solution that would help us all.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

MargaretHi Margaret,
 
I would suggest that you download and install the tandem versions just in case you ever run into that time when you need it!  You know the old saying, It's better to have it and not need it, verses needing it but not having it!  It won't cause any harm having the extra feature.  If you choose to do so, the direct download links are below for the latest versions of both J2018 and J2019.  Also, it doesn't matter whether it's Home or Pro they'll both work the same except now the Pro version is usually used in only a multiple computer licensing application, as in a business type atmosphere.

http://www.FreedomScientific.com/CertificationThanks, Mike and John.  I got the job done.  I couldn't remember being asked about tandem versions before.  My brain has been on vacation.

MargaretThat's exactly what I did.i prefer a stable screenreader for work and so that is why I went back to jaws 2018 instead of 2019.i prefer to  have an older working all the time  product instead of being a tester  which I do all day long at other facit of life."" i prefer to  have an older working all the time  product instead of being a tester  ""

I hear that; that is how I feel about Windows 10, sometimes, that we're all involuntary beta testers whenever we receive the latest updates. I know I'm not the only one who feels a frisson of tension and apprehension whenever the update process starts.

That said, if Windows keeps updating, and JAWS doesn't, you may find yourself running into problems. So far still using jAWS 2018 myself and, not too many complaints; if something doesn't work, also, I can switch to nVDA, which I do on occasion. Still though, with the current software model moving increasingly toward the service structure, where all software is constantly a work in progress, the need to stay up to date becomes more pressing.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Well, so long as Windows still supports the old direct sound standard, winamp will probably still work. Si9nce Microsoft takes backward compatibility really seriously, even though Wasapi has been around since Windows Vista, the old legacy method is still supported right up to Windows 10. And, it turns out, with good reason – surprisingly, a number of newer audio players still use it, including Foobar.The main screen comes up, but the buttons don't seem to work. I can't get to
the library. Pressing Alt-F won't bring up the menu. I tried uninstalling
and reinstalling. I got to the point of selecting selecting the classic sin.
Every time I press Finish, I get the message that information is being sent
in. The UAC prompt comes up and I say yyes, but the program seems to be in a
loop. If I wait long enough, this all goes away, but the program is the same
as before. Sorry for the long read.It's been a cuple of years now, but I seem to recall going through something
similar to this when I first got this Windows 10 machine in 2017. The person
who built my PC installed Winamp on it for me, except he did something wrong
and somehow the programme was not installed in the right place. What
happened was that, whenever I tried to make changes in preferences, the
changes would not save due to lack of access rights. As a result, I believe
the classic skin was not even loaded, since it isn't the default selection
(as far as I remember). Perhaps this is happening to you. If that was the
case, you wouldn't hear any announcement when for instance the playlist
editor was opened.

So, what directory/folder is your winamp installed in?
Try and make sure it goes into c:\program files (x86)
Also remember to run the installer as an administratorI ran the installation as administrator, and things seemed to go better. I
was able to add my library and play songs. I was able to change preferences.
However, once I closed the program and tried to get back in, the problems
occurred again. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled the program again. I have
loaded the library again. I can only wonder what will happen when I close
the program and try to go back in.Yes, the destination directory is correct. I failed to point out that
immediately after receiving the 1903 update, the program worked fine. It was
after an update this morning that things deteriorated.Hi.
So, when you tried to open Winamp again, did the User Account prompt appear?
That should not happen.

What version of Winamp are you using? I don't personally use the library for
anything. But can you get to the menus and see what, if any, other windows
you have open?
Is full screen mode for videos maybe accidentally turned on? Doubt it's this
as I don't think that feature will even work unless a video is playing.I actually have gotten things to work twice in a row.

Winamp and Windows 1903 4 messages,"Thanks for everyone’s help. It is running fine now. It seems to take a bit longer to load for some reason. I do have a large library and 16gb of RAM. Perhaps I didn’t need to go through all that. Running the installer as administrator helped greatly. I’ve never had to do that before.That is a point for everyone to consider.
When installing anything, don't just press enter on the executable, use the applications key and enter on ""run as administrator"".
This is a habit I have only started doing the past couple years.
GlennHI.
 
Glad you got it working.
 
16 GB of ram is very nice. I’m thinking of upgrading just for the hell of it, although nothing’s sped my computer up more than finally getting a solid state drive.
 
In order to make changes to the program files directories on your system, I think you need administrator rights in windows 10. If you don’t do this, the programme will install in your user folder. Some features may not work correctly.
 
Re winamp load times, I found that a few of the plugins no longer work. These are plugins that are a part of Winamp on instalation. But you can disable and remove them. I don’t’ remember exactly what I did, other than get rid of the Gracenote/CDDB plugin, but I swear there were one or two others, too. Anyway, for a while there Winamp was taking up to a minute to load for some reason, but doing this seemed to fix the problem. I can’t tell you exactly which plugins to remove though, as, well, they’re now gone on my system. :P
 Yes.
A quick way to run as admin without going through the context menu is to hit ctrl-shift-enter on the item, instead of just enter. As soon as you do that, the user account box should pop up.",,,,,1,314,52.9,11.31,86.52,44.02,12.56,16.24,84.39,74.52,58.92,13.69,7.32,4.14,0,2.55,0,0.64,6.37,14.97,7.32,1.59,16.24,9.87,6.37,6.69,2.55,20.38,4.14,5.41,3.18,0.64,0.96,1.59,15.29,1.91,13.06,3.18,1.59,1.59,2.23,0.64,5.73,0.32,3.18,2.23,0.64,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,0.32,5.41,1.59,0.96,0.32,0,0,0.64,3.82,0,0,0,0,0.32,0,0,0.32,4.46,0,0.32,3.82,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.27,0,1.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.78,7.32,0,3.82,3.82,0,0,0,5.1,4.78,5.41,1.27,0.64,0.32,0.32,0,0,18.47,8.28,5.1,0,0,3.5,1.59
Windows 10 Offline Account 2 messages,"I purchased a Windows 10 computer in May. I chose to use an off-line account. I am receiving updates but have not been offered Windows 1903. I do have an Office 365 account. I hope this doesn’t have any ramifications for future JAWS updates.Relax.?? There is no hurry to update to Windows 10 1903.?? According to Paul Therrot, a well-respected MS expert, as of June, less than 7% of all Windows 10 computers have updated to feature update 1903.?? Indeed, there have been so many reported bugs with 1903 that it may be some time before it is offered on all Windows 10 computers. So ifyou have Windows 10 1809, and Windows Update reports that you're up to date, you have nothing to worry about.

Windows 10 pro and online video playback with Jaws 4 messages,"Greetings

So  I can play online media on my HP Envy laptop running Windows 10 pro with Jaws 2019 either in Firefox or Google Chrome. However: I am unable to play the same on my Porsche Design Book1 running exactly the same OS and Jaws version save playing YouTube content. Jaws just remains silent when I press enter, do I need to install some sort of a plugin on the Porsche?


Many Thanks 


Waqas H. ChauhdryHmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm this sounds like a tech support question. I'd ask where did you buy this or suggest finding the PC department of Porsche but they may not know of JAWS but yeah something's up there.Doesn't really sound like the issue is related to JAWS  at all? But, curious what you mean by saying that jfw ""remains silent""....do you mean that it stops working?
What about other video content? Is it just the browsers that don't respond correctly to video streams? If yooutube plays but nothing else -- that's indeed quite an oddity.What I mean is Jaws does not read out any message whether any additional programme / plugin is needed to play the content. Porsche has outsourced tech support which is terrible, any help will be greatly appreciated. 


Many Thanks

"Windows Clipboard, 18 messages","Good morning;
thought some folks may be interested in this.
 
 
NOTE: The new clipboard features are available starting with Windows 10 October 2018 Update. If you have an
older version of Windows,
you cannot use the new clipboard. If the new clipboard features do not work on your PC, make sure that you enabled the Clipboard history, as shown in the
first section of this guide:
How to sync the Windows 10 clipboard with other computers and devices.
 
How to view the clipboard in Windows 10
 
In Windows 10 October 2018 Update, checking your
clipboard
contents is easy: press the Windows + V keys on your keyboard simultaneously, and you should get a window called Clipboard that lists all the items you
have copied to the clipboard. It should look similar to this:
 
The Clipboard window
The Clipboard window
 
All the items that you recently copied to the clipboard are listed vertically, starting from the most recent one at the top. If you want to see the older
clipboard items, scroll downwards in the Clipboard window.
 
The list of items in the Clipboard window
The list of items in the Clipboard window
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: The clipboard in Windows 10 only supports text, HTML code and images that are less than 1 MB in size. Any other type of content or content
that is larger than 1 MB is not saved into your clipboard, and there is no message telling you that.
 
How to paste the most recent item from the clipboard in Windows 10
 
If you want to paste the latest item that you sent to the clipboard, open the application in which you want to paste it, and press the Ctrl + V keys on
your keyboard. Usually, you can also do the same thing by right-clicking in that app window and then by choosing the Paste option from the contextual menu
displayed.
 
Pasting the last item from the clipboard
Pasting the last item from the clipboard
 
However, in Windows 10, you can also use the Clipboard window to paste the last item in it. Go to the window in which you want to paste it, press the Windows
+ V keys on your keyboard, and then click or tap the first element in the Clipboard window.

How to paste old items from the clipboard in Windows 10
 
If you want to paste older items from the clipboard, go to the app window in which you want to do that. Then, press the Windows + V keys on your keyboard,
and click or tap the item that you want to be pasted, from the Clipboard window.

How to pin items to the clipboard in Windows 10
 
Sometimes, you might have some information that you use often, and you want it to be easily accessible. A good example would be an address or a phone number
that you need to paste in multiple documents and at various times. In such a situation, the Windows 10 clipboard can be handy. You can copy that information
to your clipboard and then pin it, so that it is always available in the clipboard, even if you reboot your Windows 10 PC or clear the other contents of
the clipboard.
if your using jaws, and you want to pin an item,
1, windows-key+v=clipboard window,
2, now tab enter on,
more button,
now, use arrow key, you should see,
delete,
pin,
Clear-all.
 
hope this helps.
 
       The impossible is the untried,  Never under estimate the power of a dream.
 David,

Thanks for posting this helpful overview of the Windows 10 clipboard enhancements. These are long overdue in my opinion. I very much enjoy using the Ditto clipboard manager which sounds a bit more powerful than what you described. I especially like Ditto's ability to use formatting settings of the target location when pasting content coming from a source with different formatting settings. But having more powerful clipboard features built right into the operating system will be very convenient.

Alan Lemly This is quite useful. I could see myself posting this on the server if it is all right with you. I await your answer as always.Am I mistaken, or has Jaws not had this feature for a while?
 
I distinctly remember Eric demonstrating it on a What’s New podcast when Jonathan was still hosting them.
 
VictorI don't find ""the first section of this guide"".  I would love to have it.I did not get the first part eather to the guideThanks so much for this information.  It is greatly appreciated.
 
MelissaThe reason why I didn't post the first section,
by default the clipboard history is on by default.
if you want to verify this,

1, windows-key+i=settings,
now, you need to navigate to the system/clipboard settings,
or you simply could do a search for clipboard,
or?
you could just go to the windows search edit box, type in clipboard, you
should hear/see 
clipboard settings system settings, press enter.
also, you can turn on/off the clipboard history, within the
windows+v=clipboard window, but unable to do this with jaws.
at least it didn't work for me.



       The impossible is the untried,  Never under estimate the power of a
dream.Mine is off  I did windows V and tabbed once it said turn on button.  Jaws
2019 read the button fine.Here's the full article for those who would like to read it all.  Article is below the link.

How to use the new clipboard on Windows 10 October 2018 Update
Windows 10 introduces a new clipboard experience, and in this guide, we'll show you how to use it.
Mauro Huculak
4 Oct 2018
On Windows 10, you've been able to copy and paste text and images for a long time, but it's been an experience somewhat limited that only supported copying
one piece of content at a time and no interface to view the things you copied.
 
To overcome these limitations and to make the experience more useful, starting with the
October 2018 Update,
Windows 10 introduces a new clipboard that tracks the text and images (up to 4MB) that you copy. Also, you can finally view and paste content from the
clipboard history, and even pin items that you copy and paste more frequently.
 
In addition, leveraging the same cloud technology use to sync your Timeline content, your clipboard history can now roam and be accessible across all your
devices.
 
In this
Windows 10 guide,
we'll walk you through the steps to set up and use the new cloud-powered clipboard experience included with the October 2018 Update.

list end
 
How to enable clipboard on Windows 10
 
On Windows 10 version 1809, you can enable the new clipboard experience using the Settings app and the new keyboard shortcut.
 
Enabling clipboard using Settings
 
To enable clipboard in the Settings app, use these steps:
 
list of 4 items
Open Settings.
Click on System.
Click on Clipboard.
Turn on the Clipboard history toggle switch.
list end
 
Enabling clipboard using a shortcut
 
Alternatively, to enable clipboard using a keyboard shortcut, use these steps:
 
list of 2 items
Use the Windows key + V keyboard shortcut.
Click the Turn on button.
list end
 
After completing the steps, you can start using the clipboard experience and manage many other settings.
 
Disabling clipboard on Windows 10
 
The clipboard history device using the sis disabled by default, but you can check or disable it if the feature is turned on using these steps:
 
list of 4 items
Open Settings.
Click on System.
Click on Clipboard.
Turn off the Clipboard history toggle switch.
list end
 
Once you've completed the steps, the new clipboard experience will no longer be available without affecting the old clipboard functionality.
 
How to sync clipboard history on Windows 10
 
Perhaps one of the most interesting features about the new clipboard is the ability to paste text and images on your other devices. However, for privacy
reasons, it's a feature that you must enable and configure manually using these steps:
 
list of 5 items
Open Settings.
Click on System.
Click on Clipboard.
Under ""Sync across devices,"" turn on the toggle switch.
 
Select the automatic syncing option you want to use:
 
list of 2 items nesting level 1
Automatically sync text that I copy: Your clipboard history will sync to the cloud and across your devices.
Never automatically sync text that I copy: You must manually open the clipboard history and select the content you want to make available across devices.
list end nesting level 1
list end
 
After completing the steps, your content history will sync to the cloud and across devices using the settings you specified.
 
How to clear clipboard history on Windows 10
 
If you want to delete your clipboard history because you no longer want to use experience or something isn't working correctly, and you want to reset the
history to see if that fixes the problem, use these steps:
 
list of 4 items
Open Settings.
Click on System.
Click on Clipboard.
Under ""Clear clipboard data,"" click the Clear button.
list end
 
Once you've completed the steps, your clipboard content will be deleted from your device and Microsoft account, but pinned items will remain in the history
until you remove them manually.
 
If you're looking to delete one or two clips, instead of clearing the entire history, you can open the Windows key + V experience, and click the X button
for each content you want to delete. Alternatively, you can also click the Clear all button in the history interface to erase the list.
 
How to use clipboard on Windows 10
 
Although the new clipboard introduces a new interface and several new features, it's not an experience complicated to use.
 
The new clipboard complements the old experience that you already know. Once you upgrade to the October 2018 Update, you can still use the Ctrl + C shortcut
to copy and the Ctrl + V shortcut to paste. The same is true using the right-click context menu.
 
However, you can now use the Windows key + V shortcut to bring up the new clipboard history. In this new interface, you'll find a list of items (such as
text and images) that you have copied from different applications, such as Microsoft Word, Snip & Sketch, OneNote, etc.
 
If you want to copy and paste content from your history, use these steps:
 
list of 5 items
Select the text or image from an application.
Right-click the selection, and click the Copy or Cut option.
Open the document you want to paste the content.
Use the Windows key + V shortcut to open the clipboard history.
 
Select the content you want to paste.
list end
 
You can also pin the items that you paste frequently for faster access using these steps:
 
list of 2 items
Use the Windows key + V shortcut to open the clipboard history.
Click the Pin button for the content you paste frequently.
list end
 
When you no longer need the content, click the button again to unpin or the X button to delete the item.
 
Using the clipboard history, there are some obvious limitations as no everything you copy will appear in the history or sync across devices. For example,
you can copy the name of a file, but copying a file to move it to another location will not appear in the history.
 
Also, the cloud clipboard supports images, but only if you copy the image within a document. You cannot copy an image file and expect it to appear in the
history or sync across devices.
 
Wrapping things up
 
Although the new clipboard experience can sync your history across devices, you can only access your history on computers running Windows 10 version 1809
or later and when using the same Microsoft account.
 
If you choose to enable this feature, make sure that you also understand the potential security risks. For example, if you're one of those that usually
copy sensitive information (such as passwords, addresses, names, etc.), anything you copy to the clipboard will store in plain text, and anyone with access
to your computer will now be able to see this information by just using the Windows key + V shortcut. In addition, if you enable the sync option, you'll
also be uploading your history to the Microsoft servers.                                         
 
 

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!When I pressed the Windows Key+V for the first time to try it out, I got a notification that clipboard history was turned off and to click here to turn it on, which, obviously I did, so that was a nice surprise.

VictorWindows-V did bring up a dialog asking permission to turn on the history
feature for me- using 1903 & latest JAWS.

CherHi,
When I try to find the more button I cannot find it. I press the windows key + V and then I tab but I only hear the clear all button. Anyone know what I am doing wrong?
Mr. Edcould it be possible that your windows clipboard is empty?
 
when my clipboard is empty, there's no more button.
however, with some content on the clipboard, the more button becomes available.
 
 
 
       The impossible is the untried,  Never under estimate the power of a dream.Good man, I might just go ahead and post it on the server for future reference.I copied a large prayer on the clip board. Jaws only read just part of it. When I use Zoomtext to look at the text on the clip board I only can see part of it. But if I paste it into word it is all there. When I tab around all I have is the clear button. Also I cannot see all the text. So what am I doing wrong. Any
suggestions.
Mr. EdHi all 
Does John’s 2018 work good with the new clipboard feature the snow in windows 10What is John's 2018?

With a similar configuration, I just tested Word's ""find"" feature and realize I'm having a similar experience. However, I'm so used to treating it as a trial-and-error function that I hadn't noticed. Let me detail two experiments I just tried.

First, I pressed control-f and typed in my search term. The only way to read the term in context was to press escape and then insert-8 (""say line""). Initially, JAWS wouldn't read the line with insert-8, but it did so on my second press. So, how to reach the next result? I pressed control-f again. As I recall (I can't replicate this now JAWS verbalized ""Next result."" Assuming correctly that I was still on the first result, I pressed the spacebar. I landed on the second result, but JAWS remained uncooperative. The only way to read the context was, again, to press escape and then insert-8, the say line command.

Now, this gets interesting. I abandoned that search and started one for a different term. This time JAWS read the results pretty much as I expected and wanted. I pressed control-f and enter. JAWS read the context and then ""Next result."" I could press escape if I wanted to stay at that point or the spacebar if I wanted to move on. I chose a term that had numerous occurrences in that document, and it proceeded the same way throughout.

This is consistent with my experience. My first time through is hit-or-miss. The second time, for whatever reason, the ""find"" function works well. 

It's important because of the limitations of the JAWS search feature, which can find only whole words, not search strings that might or might not be words. Also, Word reports the number of instances of a search term.

I hope this is helpful. I realize it may not sound like it is. And you never know with JAWS, what works for one person might not for another.I saw this years ago in a Word tutorial that I got, I think, from National
Braille Press.  I changed it in my Word 2010.
It may be worth looking at in Word 2016 or 365 to see if it's still doable.

Restoring the traditional find command in Word
# Find Command for Word 2010 and above.
Here are the steps for getting CTRL+F to work in the traditional manner.
These steps work in Word 2013.  I don't have Word 2016 but I think they
should also work in that version of Word.

1.	Use Alt with F followed by T to go into the Word options.
2.	In the list of categories either use down arrow or press the letter
C until you get to the ""customize ribbon"" category.
3.	Press Alt with T to use the customize button.
4.	Use down arrow until you get to the Home tab.
5.	Tab to the commands list.
6.	In the commands list press E until you find the ""EditFind"" command.
7.	Tab a couple times to the ""press new shortcut key"" box.
8.	Press CTRL with F.
9.	Tab to the Save Changes In box and choose Normal.DOTM.
10.	Tab to the Assign button and press spacebar.
11.	Tab to the Close button and use spacebar. 
12.	Tab to OK and use spacebar.Rebecca,
Thanks for posting these steps. They do work in Word 2016. Unfortunately, they've made no difference on my system. If anything, I know longer get the benefit I described last night when I perform a second ""find."" With luck, the situation will return to normal. Did I hear someone say, ""Situation normal. FUBAR""?I use control-f to find the word.  You will be on a 
Find next button rather than the word you searched for.
Press escape and you will be on the word in the text of the document.  There
you can use JAWS up arrow to read the line for context.
If that's not the right occurrence of the word, use the Word find next
command
Shift-f4 and you will be placed on the next occurrence without having to
escape out of a 
Find next button.  Again use JAWS up arrow to read for context.
Not so hard.  Smile.Thanks Rebecca, I'm not sure why the search quit working since I moved over
to Win10 from win7 but now this has it working again. Unfortunately, it
doesn't tell me how many occurrences are found now that I have reassigned
the ctrl+f key using these steps.I guess I've had mine set this way for so long that I don't ever remember
being told how many times the search word occurs.  I just press shift-f4
until I find what I need.  Smile.  
The JAWS find command
JAWS-control-f 
does not tell you how many occurrences there are either.
If you use Word's search and replace, it does tell you how many times the
word was found.
So I typed a document using the word
Test
Several times.
I pressed 
control-h 
for find and replace.
I told Word to search for
Test
And to replace it with
Test
The same word.
I tabbed to replace all and was promptly told that Word had made seven
replacements.
So if you absolutely need to know how many times you've repeated yourself by
using the same word, there's your work-around.  Smile.The item count only came in since I upgraded from Jaws14 and Win7. So it
doesn't really make much difference to me the best is that now the Ctrl+f
feature works again.So>  I didn't solve this problem.  Vispero told me to call and we would work on it.  Before I had time to do that, my grandson used the offending computer for a game of some kind.  Before calling Vispero I tested to be sure it still didn't work ... and \
""find"" read the word it found as well as the context.  whatever the kid did fixed the problem.

Word Crashes & Mark-up,"Hello,
 
I am using the latest build of JAWS2019, and the latest version of Office 16 (or maybe it is 365) on a Windows 10 machine.  I have been having a lot of trouble with Word staying running.  It is rare that Windows will restart Word after it stops working.  I’m thinking the problem is when mark-ups, comments, etc. are on, but I’m not sure.  Things seem to be working much better since I turned all of these things off in both Word and JAWS.  Has anyone else experienced this?
 
Thanks in advance.

Workaround for JAWS 2019 pre August update and Skype 8.51,"I finally got Skype 8.51 onto my laptop, which allowed me to work out the following trick for using my scripts without installing the JAWS 2019 August update. Note that because the scripts do not load, or at least do not
reliably load under the scenario being worked around, this problem cannot reasonably be resolved via modifications to the scripts themselves.

If you use Skype 8.51 and my latest Skype scripts are installed but do not load (i.e., Insert+Q inside Skype says Chrome rather than Skype settings are loaded):

Edit the ConfigNames.ini file in the JAWS user folder (not the shared folder). One way to open this folder is to launch Explore My Settings for JAWS 2019. Pressing Enter on ConfigNames.ini from there should open the file in
Notepad.

If there is no line saying [Domains], add one.

Below the [Domains] line, add this:

Index=skypeelectron

Save the file and restart JAWS.

Warning: Doing this may adversely impact the operation of other Electron-based apps you may use. You can always remove the addition(s) and restart JAWS again to retrace your steps.

Also, it should go without saying (though I'm saying it anyway) that mis-editing this file could cause other things to stop working as expected.

I am not certain that this workaround will work in all cases. It should not be required past the JAWS 2019 August update though.

All of the previously accessible controls disappeared. They reappeared once the moderator stopped sharing their screen with the rest

I haven’t used zoom to this extent so haven’t run in to this. Question, do you have the scripts from Brian Hartgen? Also, if you want to seriously learn the entire zoom platform, you might want to consider making a small investment and purchasing Jonathan Mosens book, Meet me in the cloud. It’s brilliant, as is all his material and will guide you through every aspect of using zoom.Mystic Access has a free download of a session on how to attend meetings with Zoom.   To my knowledge, all three of the hosts for Mystic Access are totally blind, so maybe they do not share their screen, but it’s worth checking out the free session to be sure you get any tips.

www.turner42.comI’d agree with you, except the “whatever” key is not always the insert key, depending on the layout you choose. Some prefer the capslock key, and I think it is even possible to map it to something else if you want to. Hence, whatever key you have assigned is the “screen-reader” key, and using that terminology avoids the confusion of discussing what would be the wrong key for some users.For what it is worth, if they changed it, they would know which one it is, right?
So I was addressing the generic question about the default.
Now if someone changed it and forgot what they did, that is another story.
Thanks,

 Tim,
 
I have tried to use List view.  I just tried it again. When I do this, I am placed at the top of a list with the most future dated item at the top.  Here at work, holidays are auto loaded on our calendars, so the top entry on my calendar is Christmas Day 2028.  It also doesn’t seem that the Control G command to go to a particular date is working in this view. 
 
Maybe your calendar is a lot less cluttered than mine, but I’d be interested to hear your experience with using this format.  Are you placed on today’s entries when you open your calendar or are you placed at the top of the list?

a question regarding skype and teams,"Some of my students have switched to teams due to company policy, their company not the one  I work for. They are not aloud to use personal skype on their systems to make personal accounts, which puts me in an odd situation.

I'm expected to stay in touch with these  students, which I can via voice, (I have no idea how teams and skype can still talk via voice)  but I cannot communicate with them via chat. They  don't see any of my messages and I don't see any of theirs. So is there a way to make this work with those restrictions, that being:


No personal skype on the system
No business skype on the system
No personal skype accounts aloud, just teams.
I must use skype and not teams


Or am I kind of SOL?

about Jaws and freedom scientific 25 messages,"about  Jaws and  freedom scientific,    Hi list, wait to you hear this one,
Well another friend had this come up after he added or went in to the jaws settings center,
 he added some key strokes for the window eyes keyboard another words, you can add a windows strokes like in windoweyes in windoweyes you can add the hole keyboard or I think 1 keystroke at a time, and also there is in the tab you tab once and you can delete the key board, or the keystroke, unlike windoweyes, there is no delete key in the settings center or after tabbing around in there, when you add it there should be one and he worked on the computer for hours and hours.
So he finally called Freedom scientific he doesn't call that much, the customer person who he talked to was rude and flipid and was nasty, my point is that he told me, that she didn't want to tell him how to delete the keystroke, in case he needed to, he finely convinced her after arguing with her back and forth, and also after reinstalling windows10, with her snotty attitude, she said, well this is for very advanced users, and he had to tell her that he had been using computers for a very long time, here is what she said.
Well sir it is in the user settings jaws and then in the enu, this shows you how stupid and pigheaded freedom scientific is , and this is why there is always trouble with Jaws, and freedom scientific, once again is now in bankrupsey, I hope they go out of business, and a better company takes over, and redoes jaws, so it won't mess around with windows, Microsoft, should have never let freedom scientific, get under the hood, they should have done the same thing that apple did, keep a closed system, folks, if NVDA can do it why can't freedom scientific do the same thing, this is not a very good and reliable company, your thoughts please from Joseph. yes, and when you listen to the fs casts they make it sound like Jaws is the only thing that keeps blind people working. They had someone on the last podcast bragging about how they can work for Disney all because of Jaws Larry gassman said that many more people would be unemployed if it was not for Jaws freedom scientific is lying to people and they make it sound like they are the only reason why any blind people have a job.
David Moore come on oh my God where's my job what the heckThis is why I use nvda and system access all the way.That might have been true at one time, like twenty years ago.
Glenngrate David, can you or someone help with getting my homepage in google chrome, so it will startup like in IE and firefox, don't want to go to the search engine, unless I do thanks a lot David from Joe, my friend will be happy to hear this about freedom scientific, i'm using windows7   I like jaws and I do appreciate the product but since Jonathon left is not great show. I know that they suppose to do things different but to many interviews about people who I do not care and want to know. They need to keep focus more on talking about jaws and not about others. Just saying before the owner starts getting upset about this discussion.Sure thing! Just go to the settings webpage and down arrow to three buttons. The third button says select page or pages. Press enter on that, and arrow down to the edit box, and just type in the Google web address. That is all I did to get Google to be my homepage, and start page. I really like Google to be my start page and home page as well. I like Google a lot, and don't use the search engine either. I hope that works, David Moorethanks David, well I did that, and chrome came up with add a new page button, so I did that, would some day like to add my coast page also, my weather page is my home page, also where can I add my coast page, do I tab to the other buttons that says add a specific page from Joseph.   Hi you are exactly right just enter on what you said and you can add as many websites as you want. I am glad it is starting to work better for you. Go chrome! You will love it once you get used to it! David Moore
I love chrome.Well, actually, JAWS kept me working on my last job because my employer would only pay for JAWS and would only allow me to use JAWS as a screen reader.
 
Andywell david how can I go from another page to another page, maybe some time we can do a tandum,After awhile of launching and exiting chrome during the day, I have a problem that chrome no longer opens my homepage but opens a new tab and I have it set to open with my homepage.  I hope google fixes that!
 
E-mail is golden!!!
Kevin LeeThat was probably because of a sales pitch, either from the rehab agency, or from someone at FS.
 Joe,
I believe that if you put other pages in there, you can control + tab through them.
Otherwise, you can go to the address bar and arrow down.
Glenntried that no luckwell david you spoke to soon, sometimes it chrome opens with my weather page and sometimes not, tried to put the coast page, can't control to the pagesMy last thought about this if more companies use apple, I wonder how many of us will use jaws. I do use jaws and like it but like I stated.With all do respect, could the Chrome discussion be started under a different thread?

Kevin LeeIt is in the guidelines so as not to create a kind of personal chat listCould you send link to this tutorial?I have had it happen. It’s not consistent.Hi Loy,
 
Here's the tutorial:

Tutorial for Using the Google Chrome Browser
By David Moore
Kevin Lee converted this tutorial to MS Word document and inserted bookmarks to make the tutorial easier to read.
To navigate this tutorial with jaws, press insert+alt+B
To bring up the list of headings then select one and press enter.
 
 
 
Heading One: Introduction and Getting Started!
This tutorial will be done with the latest update of Chrome.
I will also use JAWS 2019. Narrator works very well in Chrome as well.
I will not cover Narrator in this tutorial.
Finally, I will use Windows 10 1809.
I will assume that you have downloaded and installed Chrome.
There should be a shortcut on your desktop.
Next, we need to make sure that the Chrome browser always launches maximized, so it works properly.
To make sure that this always happens, do the following:
Go to the Chrome icon on your desktop, and press:
Alt+Enter
to open the properties dialog.
Make sure that you are on the short cut page. Now, tab one time past the short cut edit, and make sure that the combo box says maximized, and press enter.
Of course, you can type a letter in the short cut edit, like C for Chrome, and the Alt and CTRL are added.
You are done, and Chrome will always come up maximized.
If you open any Window, including Chrome,
you can press:
Windows+Up-arrow
to maximize any window.
Heading One: Setting Up, and Customizing Chrome
First, I will launch Chrome. We will not create a home page until we get to the Chrome settings web page.
Pressing the Alt key, opens the one and only, Chrome menu, with many choices that I will arrow down through.
I will press the Alt key.
JAWS says the following:
Customize and control Google Chrome
Ignore that, and down arrow one time.
This will put you on the first item of the Chrome menu.
The Chrome menu is open.
I will press insert+up arrow to hear the first option in this menu.
New Tab, CTRL+T.
You can press that command right from the web site you are on.
New Window, CTRL+N
You can press these commands right from your web page, instead of coming here.
New incognito window Ctrl+Shift+N
History sub menu.
I will press right arrow here to see what is in this sub menu!
History, CTRL+H
So, there is a key command for reading your history.
You can read a few sites you were on right here.
I will press left arrow to close this history sub menu.
Downloads, CTRL+J
There is the command for opening your downloads you have downloaded with Chrome.
Heading level two! Bookmarks
Next, we have the important Bookmarks sub menu.
I will press right arrow, to open this.
I hear, bookmark this page, CTRL+D
That command will bookmark the page you are reading.
Next down arrow, says show bookmarks bar, CTRL+Shift+B
That command, will show your bookmarks on your Chrome browser for all to see. I do not want that.
Here is the important one.
manage bookmarks
The command is, CTRL+Shift+O
In here, you can organize your bookmarks into folders, see the bookmarks you have imported from different browsers, and very importantly, you can download,
to your computer, an HTML file of all of your bookmarks in Chrome.
On your computer, you can press enter on this file, after it downloads, and a page will show up in Chrome with a list of all bookmarks you have saved in
Chrome. This is an awesome way to download all of your bookmarks right to your computer, so you can back them up.
That is all for manage bookmarks.
Next, I hear import bookmarks and settings.
press enter on this, and you can import all bookmarks and settings from IE, and Firefox, right into Google Chrome, and they will be in their corresponding
folders.
Next, I hear all of my saved bookmarks as I continue to arrow down.
Very important!
Sometimes, when I open that bookmarks sub menu, I do not land on the choices I mention here, but instead, I start hearing my saved bookmarks. If this happens,
I press up arrow a few times, and it gets me to these choices.
Keep in mind, that many of these choices, like bookmark manager, have key commands, so you do not have to come to this bookmarks sub menu at all. You only
need to come here most of the time, to arrow through your saved bookmarks, and enter on the desired one.
Heading One, Back to the Chrome Menu
The next few options in the Chrome menu, are very self explanatory.
The next one I will mention, is the more tools submenu.
I will press right arrow on this.
I hear Save Page as, and the command, CTRL+S.
Next, Save to desktop.
This allows you to save the favorite of the page right to your desktop. This is how you do this in Chrome, instead of doing this in the file menu in IE.
It is hidden under this more tools submenu.
Clear Browsing data, and there is the key command, CTRL+Shift+Delete key.
Extensions, In here, you can add extensions, delete extensions and so on.
These are the same as add-ons, in IE.
They are called Extensions in Chrome.
The last two that I will mention, are the help sub menu and then, the big menu category, settings.
I will press right arrow on the:
Help sub menu, and down arrow:
we have:
About Google Chrome
You can get your version and other info, if you press enter on that.
Then we have:
Help Center:
That one is huge.
If you press enter on that, an entire help center comes up for Chrome, just like for other programs.
I would strongly encourage you to go through that help center or help system.
In there, you can find all of the short cut commands for Chrome.
The third choice:
Report an issue.
That is it for the help sub menu.
Heading Two: Working with Chrome's Settings
To adjust many of these settings, it is necessary to have a Google account.
Having an account with Google, helps a lot with using Chrome.
If you have a Gmail account, you automatically have a Google account.
Let us create our Google account now!
First, launch the Chrome browser and type the URL:
www.google.com
This will bring up the Google Search Engine in Chrome.
Arrow down the page until it says:
create an account.
Press enter on that, and just type in an email address, and password, and your Google account is created.
Next, press the Alt key, and arrow up to settings, because it is at the bottom of the large vertical menu.
Press enter on settings, and a web page will open.
To get back to your webpage in Chrome, just press CTRL+W to close the tab.
Settings opens up in a new tab!
Next, on the settings web page, press H until you hear sign in with Chrome.
Press enter, and enter your email and password that you used to create your Google account.
Now, we will start at the top of the settings page, and work our way down, and go through all of the settings, which there are more than any other browser.
By the way, you can use all of your navigation commands on this settings page, just like any other web page.
Each group of settings, is a heading.
So, to move from one group of settings to another, you only need to press:
H
for heading.
This makes it very nice to navigate through your settings.
This is just like a regular web page.
There will be settings that we press enter on, and another entire page of settings will open.
It is just like pressing enter on a link on a web page, doing what you want, and then you have to go back to the previous web page.
You will have to do that a lot, here in the settings, because there are sub settings, and more sub settings under a single sub setting.
It is a lot like working with settings in Windows 10, only this is just like working on a web page.
Now, I will start from the top on this settings page.
Press CTRL+Home, and you will hear Main menu button.
Do not pay attention to that. Press E for edit, and you will land on an edit field, where you can type in the first few letters of a setting.
This is very convenient to get to a setting very quickly, and change that setting if so desired.
However, we will not put anything into the edit field, so we will start the down arrow process from this edit field.
Make sure that you to do not get into forms mode when in this edit field.
Down arrow once, and you will hear:
Heading level two:
People!
Down arrow again, and you will hear your name, because you have signed into Chrome.
You can sync your bookmarks, downloads, all settings, and more across your devices so when you open Chrome on any device, it will have everything the same
on every device you open Chrome on.
It will then say:
Syncing to:
and then it will read out your email.
Down arrow, and you will hear turn off.
You can turn syncing on or off here.
It will say that all syncing is on, but you can arrow down and press enter on the sync button, and tell Chrome what to sync across all devices you open
Chrome on.
All of this is stored on Google, because you created an account in Google.
Arrow down, and you have:
import bookmarks and settings.
Notice that JAWS says this twice on two different lines.
This is very common in the Chrome settings, where it says the same thing, on two different lines.
Always press enter on the second line, where it says button after the setting.
That is important.
So, press enter on Import bookmarks and settings button.
Here, you can import all bookmarks and settings from other browsers you have installed on your computer.
This is just a second place you can do this from.
Remember, that was available in the Chrome menu, under:
More Tools.
Now, we have another heading level two, AutoFill.
All groups of settings are heading level two, so you can just press the number 2 to get from one group of settings, to another!
Now, you will hear, Passwords.
Press enter on this:
An edit field appears where you can type in a password.
This is important later.
You can type in a password, to delete it or save it.
If you save passwords, Chrome stores a list of all the passwords you type into Chrome!
Arrow down, and it will say:
Click to offer to save passwords.
If you press enter once, it will toggle it off, no password will be saved.
Press enter again, and it will turn that on, and Chrome will save all passwords.
Next, pres:
Alt+left arrow,
to go back to the main settings page.
Next, you will hear payment method.
I do not mess with this at all.
Next, press enter on Addresses and More.
This will allow you to let addresses populate as you type in a web address.
I like this.
You can add addresses that you want Chrome to save right here!
Next, press enter on the back button, or press:
Alt+Left arrow,
to go back to the main settings page.
The next heading level two is:
Appearance.
We have:
Themes, open Chrome web store.
If you press enter here, you will open the Chrome store, where you can find all kinds of Chrome extensions.
Chrome uses the term:
extensions,
instead of add-ons.
They are the same thing.
Now, there is an important toggle.
This toggles weather you want the home button to show up on the Chrome toolbar at the top of the screen.
I have this turned on.
Now, there are a set of radio buttons that deal with what you want your home page to look like.
The home page, is the web page that will come up every time you press:
Alt+Home
This can be different or the same as your start up page or one of your start up pages.
We will get to your start up pages later.
Press enter on one of the following radio buttons that are present.
I checked the radio button:
Enter Custom Web Address.
I like my home page to be a certain web site.
An edit field appears, and I typed in:
www.google.com
That is my home page.
Next, there is a toggle to show or not show your bookmarks on the toolbar at the top of the page.
I do not want all of my bookmarks showing up there, so I have this not checked.
Next is font size.
I have mine on medium, but you could change this by pressing:
Alt+Down arrow to open a combo box.
Next, you can change the zoom level, but there are short cut key commands to do this.
Now, we get to the next heading level two group of settings.
Here, we can customize our Search engine we want to use by default when we type a search in the address bar.
This is the address bar, and a search field all in one.
I have mine set to Google in the combo box!
There is a button where you can manage search engines.
I don't mess with this!
Now, we have our next heading group of settings to make Chrome the default browser or not.
Next, our next heading group of settings deals with what happens when we start up Chrome.
Here, we will type in our start up web pages and more.
Here, we have another set of radio buttons.
We can have Chrome start with a new tab page, or blank page, we can have Chrome start up where we left off in our last session, or we can have Chrome start
up with a specific page or set of pages.
This is the choice I choose.
You can have Chrome start up with as many web pages you want, all opened in different tabs.
This is tab browsing.
I just have Chrome open with one web page.
www.google.com
That is the same as my home page.
You can have your start up page, be the same as your home page.
Heading Level three: Advanced Settings
Now, we get to a huge heading:
advanced settings.
This is closed, so you have to press enter to open up all of these advanced settings.
We will have many settings here.
Notice, that this is such a large heading of settings, that I am putting it under Heading three.
Notice that when we enter on settings, we are taken to another page with more settings.
These are sub pages.
It is like the main settings page, is like a normal web page with many links which take you to another page, and then you have to go back to the main web
page.
Now, here under the advanced settings, there will be settings, that will open to another page of settings, when you press enter on the button.
After adjusting the settings on that sub page, you will have to go back to the advanced settings page with Alt+Left arrow.
Keep in mind, that the Advanced settings is a sub page of the main settings page.
To get back to the main page, at this point, you have to press:
Alt+Left arrow to get back to the main settings page.
Many of these pages also have a back button to go back to the previous page.
There are so many settings in Chrome, they can be hard to find.
That is why the search field on the main settings page is so powerful, because you can search for any setting, no matter where it is on these web pages.
Here we go, through many settings and web pages of settings in the advanced settings.
The first heading is:
Privacy and security
We have:
Allow Chrome sign-in.
I have this turned on, because I want to be signed in with my account, every time I open Chrome!
Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar:
I have this checked.
Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly.
I have this checked.
Use a web service to help resolve navigation errors
Protects you and your device from dangerous sites
I have this unchecked.
Safe Browsing
I have this checked.
Sends some system information and page content to Google
Help improve Safe Browsing
I have this unchecked.
Automatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Google
I have this checked!
Use a web service to help resolve spelling errors
I definitely have this checked.
Chrome will alert you to spelling errors that you type into any edit fields, or social media!
Send a ""Do Not Track"" request with your browsing traffic
I have this unchecked.
However, you might want to check this.
When you get on a web site, you can request that web site not to keep track of your browsing on that sight, so you might want to check that.
This is an example of security measures that are in newer browsers that are not in IE.
Allow sites to check if you have payment methods saved
I don't mess with this!
Manage certificates
Manage HTTPS/SSL certificates and settings
Manage certificates
I have this checked, but I don't know anything about this.
Content settings
This is a big group of settings and other pages of settings.
We first have the heading:
Control what information websites can use and what content they can show you
Content settings
Again, press enter on the second one that says button.
There are a bunch of settings, and I leave them all as they are, but you might want to change them.
Here are all the content settings:

Sound
Here is the most important setting in here is sound,
I allow my web sites to play media as soon as they come up, but here is where you would press the spacebar to turn that off.
This is where you can stop web sites from playing any media when they open.
This is huge.
So, in Chrome, you can tell, by checking the button under the sound choice, not to have web sites play any media or anything.
Next Heading:
Automatic downloads
Ask when a site tries to download files automatically after the first file
Automatic downloads

Ask when a site wants to use a plugin to access your computer

If you press enter on the PDF button here, you can tell Chrome weather you want your PDF to open in the browser, or in your PDF reader like Adobe DC.
If you press enter on any of these settings, like this one, another page may open, and you will have to go back to this content settings page.
That is important!
Protected content

Payment Handlers
Allow sites to install payment handlers

Now, press the back button or Alt+Left arrow to go back to the advanced settings page.
Heading level two: Back to the Advanced Settings Page
Notice that we are opening up a setting with more settings, and going back to the advanced settings page.
Keep in mind, that this advanced settings was the last category on the main settings page.
We still have to go back to get on the main settings page.
It is just like a web page, with headings and links, we open those links, make a lot of those changes, and on this second page, there are links where you
can open a third page of sub settings to make even more changes to more settings.
You cannot get to all the settings on the main settings page.
We have to open sub pages of settings in a sense.
You should spend a lot of time in the settings, and keep messing around by opening a sub category, and opening a second sub category on that page.
When you open a new settings page, you just keep going back a web page, just like you do with surfing the Internet in general.
So, now we are back to the advanced settings page, and we have been here for a long time.
There are many settings in Chrome, so you can customize it to your liking.
Next heading:
Now, we have clear browsing data!
We can press enter on this, and choose what we want to clear.
This is what I do.
So, pressing enter on:
Clear browsing data, we have the following.
Remember, press enter on the clear browsing data button, which is the second time JAWS says it, and it says button.
Here is what JAWS says if we down arrow from the top:
Clear browsing data
Basic
Advanced
Don't worry about the advanced tab.
Those are two tabs.
You can here what I have next.
Time range
Time range
All time
That is a combo box you can change.
 Browsing history Clears history from all signed-in devices. Your Google Account may have other forms of browsing history at myactivity.google.com.
Here is a huge web site you want to remember.
You can go to that web site, and delete even more history and make even more changes to Chrome.
I have never gone to that web site.
So, again, the web site is:
myactivity.google.com
arrowing down:
 Cookies and other site data Signs you out of most sites. You'll stay signed in to your Google Account so your synced data can be cleared.
 Cached images and files Frees up 105 MB. Some sites may load more slowly on your next visit.
I can delete 105 MB, here, that is quite a bit.
Cancel
Clear data
I will press enter on clear data now in my Chrome browser.
It says that all data is cleared, and it took me back to the advanced settings page.
I will continue to down-arrow through the advanced settings page.
Next heading:
Languages

 Show language options

Next heading:

Location
C:\Users\jesus\Downloads
Change
Here is where you can change where your downloads are saved.
 Ask where to save each file before downloading
I have that checked.
If you do not want the message to come up where the download is being saved, you can uncheck that button.
Next Heading:
Printing
Printers
Printers
Google Cloud Print
Google Cloud Print
You can set up printers here, and Google Cloud print.
I do nothing with this!
Next heading:
Accessibility
Add accessibility features
Open Chrome Web Store
Add accessibility features
If you press enter on this button, the Chrome web store will open with all extensions for accessibility.
This is powerful to press enter here, because you know that only the extensions for accessibility will be shown.
I have the Just Read extension, which is like reading mode in other browsers.
There are many extensions you might want to brows through when the store page opens with all of the accessibility extensions. You can just press enter
on any of the extensions, and add them to the Chrome browser.
You will have to go to the main Chrome menu, and open your extensions, and turn on any new ones you have added to Chrome.
Chrome has many more extensions than any other browser.
You can have many add-ons to your Chrome browser to make it even more powerful!
Next Heading:
System
 Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed
I have that checked.
 Use hardware acceleration when available
I have that checked.
Open proxy settings
Open proxy settings
I do nothing with this.
Last heading of the Advanced settings page of the Chrome settings:
Reset and clean up
Restore settings to their original defaults
Restore settings to their original defaults
You can press enter on that to restore your browser to factory defaults.
Remember, the second one is the button you press enter on.
It says button with JAWS.
This is the only place I can find this option in Chrome.
Clean up computer
Clean up computer
You can press enter on the button here!
I am not sure what happens.
It looks like you can clean up your computer right here.
That is the end of Advanced settings within the Chrome settings.
So, we can go back to the main settings page.
Just press:
CTRL+W to close the settings tab, and you will be taken back to your web page you were on before opening the main vertical Chrome menu!
Heading Level One: Using Chrome a bit!
Now, that we have made all of these changes and gone through all of these settings to set up Chrome, let us give the Chrome Browser a whirl now!
I will press enter on Chrome on my desktop.
Indeed, Chrome opens very quickly, to my start up page:
www.google.com
Now, to type in a web address, you can do it two ways.
I press:
CTRL+L
Except for IE, for all other browsers, that is the command to type in an URL.
You can also press:
Alt+D
and you are in the address bar, and everything is selected, so you can just start typing your URL there.
Press:
Enter
when you are done.
However, I want to point out something on this Google page.
Notice that if you press:
the letter E
to get to the search edit field to do a Google search, you can down-arrow from that, and hear:
Search By Voice button.
If you press enter on that, you can talk to Google, just like you can with Google assistant to a point.
You can ask Google a question, and many times, she will give you the answer out loud.
You will hear the same voice as you do with the Google Assistant.
You can ask her more questions, than using Cortana in Windows 10.
She will give you the answer out loud, or you can read her answer on the page by pressing down arrow.
This is very powerful, and that is a reason why I have the Google page set as my home page, and my start page.
Also, I know that I can do a Google search by typing in the search edit field on the Google page.
However, if I do a search in the address bar, I will do a Google search, because I set my default search engine in the settings to Google.
Now, I will press CTRL+L, and type in the following URL:
www.freedomscientific.com
The page came up in a second, with a six MBPS Internet connection.
I pressed:
Insert+F7, for the list of links, and pressed enter on Training.
I have a page with all of the normal elements, and many headings.
I can use all of the same navigation commands that you can use in IE.
All JAWS commands work in Chrome.
Now, I am going to download a free Webinar.
I press enter on download, and I get the download dialog right there.
I can tab through the dialog, and press enter on save.
Now, instead of pressing CTRL+N
here is what I will do.
Press CTRL+J
to get into all of your downloads that you have downloaded with Chrome.
If I press tab, it tells me the percent of the download there is left, and other information.
It told me that the download was complete.
I have a choice to open the folder it downloaded to.
Here I am, in my downloads folder.
Now, you can tab in this downloads page, and clear all of your downloads.
To get back to the webinar page, just press:
CTRL+W
to close that tab.
When you press CTRL+J, to get into downloads, it opens in another tab.
This is how most browsers work.
Well, I will close this tutorial.
I hope you can understand all of the settings, especially, and how to change them.
Chrome is a very powerful browser, and great for streaming and more.
I showed you, in the advanced settings, where to turn that on or off, right when the page loads.
If you want to stream a video, for example, just find the link to the video and press enter to launch the player.
Google Chrome, has a great player, built right into the browser.
Let me know if you have any questions.
This is the end of the tutorial.
      

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.I don't think that refers to this situation.
GlennSounded to me like they wanted a link to download it or something.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!I thingk you use Chrome, so I installed AdBlockPlus for Chrome, but haven't been able to figure it out as of yet.  Below are some notes I found doing a search and a link that might help more.  If you getter figured out please let the list know how you did it.
 
Featured snippet from the web
You can also manually set AdBlock to run in whitelist mode:
1. Click the AdBlock button and select Options.
2. On the CUSTOMIZE tab under ""Stop blocking ads,"" click Show ads everywhere except for these domains. ... 
3. Type the domain(s) where you don't want to see ads. ... 
4. Click OK.

Disable AdBlock on the current page (whitelist or exclude a web page)
 
To always allow ads to show on the page you're currently viewing, click the AdBlock button and select Don't run on this page. This creates a whitelist
rule in AdBlock.
 
Tip: Whitelist rules are also known as exception rules—or sometimes exclusion rules—because they tell ad blockers to make an exception for or exclude whatever
the rule refers to.
 
AdBlock will not block ads on the current page but will still block them everywhere else, including on other pages on the same site.
 
To start blocking ads on that page again:
 
• Click the AdBlock button and select Enable AdBlock on this page.
 
If you don't see that on the AdBlock menu and you're certain you're viewing the page you originally whitelisted, try removing the exception rule manually:
 
1. Click the AdBlock button and select Options.
2. On the CUSTOMIZE tab next to ""Manually edit your filters,"" click Edit.
3. Delete any line containing the name of the website.
4. Click Save.
5. Go back to the page you were viewing and reload it.
 
Disable AdBlock on the current site (whitelist or exclude a website)
 
To always allow ads to show on the site you're currently visiting, click the AdBlock button, select Don't run on pages on this site (Chrome) or Don't run
on pages on this domain (other browsers) and click Exclude.
 
AdBlock will not block ads on any page in any tab on the current site, but will still block them on other sites.
 
To start blocking ads on that site again:
 
• Click the AdBlock button and select Enable AdBlock on this page.
 
If you don't see that on the AdBlock menu, try removing the exception rule manually:
 
1. Click the AdBlock button and select Options.
2. On the CUSTOMIZE tab next to ""Manually edit your filters,"" click Edit.
3. Delete any line containing the name of the website.
4. Click Save.
5. Go back to the page you were viewing and reload it.

Yes, I use chrome, but I should’ve mentioned I would like to do this for IE which I visit sites from there since chrome is terrible there.
I just remembered how to do it via IE as I am typing this so let me go getter done.
The google chrome suggestion, I’ll try at a later date.
 
Thanks bro!

kimsansong@...Okay, here you go:
File path:
C:\Program Files\Adblock Plus for IE\html\templates\index.html
 
1. Open Ad Block Plust in the Programs Files folder.
2. Open the HTML folder.
3. Open the Templates folder & inside you'll find:
firstRun.html
These are the settings when you first installed the program & are the default settings.
 
index.html

annual license for Open Book? 21 messages,"Hi all.  Since there's now an annual license for Jaws home users, has FS or Vispero considered having something similar for Open Book software?  Just curious; thanks.


PeterI think this would be useful.  And should be suggested.I don't get the impression that OpenBook is being updated with enough frequency to justify paying an annual license for it.

Alan Lemly
true.  they haven't updated it in a few years now and it would be nice to see something new from them sometime in the near future.Maybe 25 dollars a year would be worth it.
 What more could be done to it in your opinion?
 yeah but i don't think anymore than that.?? as it is it seems like a rather large amount for Jaws.?? but if you are only going to update Jaws every few years it may be worth it to somehonestly, i really don't know.?? but just the thought that they haven't done anything with it kind of makes it feel rather antequaited.?? maybe i am wrong here and i am certainly no expert.Perhaps they can have an auto detect for scanning devices with a bunch of needed drivers.
I have difficulty with it finding my canon 650U scanner in Windows 7, and there are none at Canon for Windows 7.
Glenn
as a long time Openbook user, and one who had been on their private beta team for close to ten years, I can say, they have done nothing significant with OpenBook for several years; but you all have already received something new from them.
The updates to the Convenient OCR and Picture Smart have been good additions.
Whether they are planning to put all the extra features from OpenBook into convenient OCR is anyone's guess.
I personally have concluded that OpenBook is what it is and will no longer be updated. 
I hope I'm wrong.

Indeed. I know everyone’s needs are different and if you’ve got a lot of physical documents you want to be able to scan, you may still need a program like this, but honestly, I don’t think I’ve used a stand alone OCR scanning software in a while and have done so sporadically in general for a good long while now. In my case it’s Kurzweil 1000, but still. I do it so infrequently now that it takes me a minute to figure out what I’m doing instead of it coming to me second nature.
Between the enhanced Jaws OCR and the various iOS OCR solutions, it’s no wonder programs like these aren’t receiving the attention they once did.
I’m not saying that they’re not needed anymore per say since again, folks still receive paper documents and not everyone’s got a smart device, but from how it was before to now. It really is every blue moon.
 Since there are so many cheaper options in smart phones, it is my
guess that current features in OpenBook will be slowly incorporated
into future versions of JAWS.

AllenSince I use k1000 in my practice all day long .its very intuitive to me .as well have all kinds of  OCR apps on my smart phones as well.so for me OCR is a key part of my life both in professional and personal life.I use OB for pictures and PDF files as well.
 It isn’t, it’s been at version 9 since the late 90s
 
E-mail is golden!!!
Kevin LeeGood luck!
 
E-mail is golden!!!
Kevin LeeThis to me is kind of a grey area. Open Book is self voicing and there for off topic. On the other hand you can use it with JAWS with some fiddling that I know how to do but I wonder how many others know those tricks. So for the most part I come down on the side of it being off topic.I was not going to say anything more after Rick's note about this being off topic until someone gave crazy wrong information.
Openbook 9 was release about 10 years ago, not 20--which would be the late 90's. I'm not sure when the transition happened between Archenstone to Openbook, but it was in the late 90's. 
Sorry, but I had to chime in.

It's perfect for a high email volume.  I use it for work.  I use Thunderbird for personal  email.  It's pretty straightforward yet much faster and easier to use than, say, gmail on its own site.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”I agree, I use outlook, windows live will not work on my win ten system.The only thing I don't like about Outlook is that the find utility is less comprehensive and is harder to find search criteria options than it is in OE, and Windows Live and WinMail.
But if one does not routinely search for past messages like I do, this may not be an issue.

I also use Outlook with Windows 10. Outlook 2016 to be exact. Hope this helps,

can't control + right arrow in Outlook 2013 8 messages,"Hi,
A friend has Jaws, Outlook 2013, and Windows 10.
Her eMail has just started not allowing her to use control + right arrow through words in eMail.
I had her try insert + 6 on the number pad and try maximizing the eMail program and the message window, but those ideas did not help.
Any ideas?
Thanks.
GlennI should add that she does not have this problem with NVDA.
She said nothing was added other than Outlook2013, and the guy at the Microsoft disability department installed it for her.
GlennDid she try using the jaws key plus right arrow, that’s what I use mostly?
 
LarryHi, 
Is there a way to repair office through programs and features? That might fix it. I think someone on another tech list is experiencing this problem. Thanks.

Get Outlook for iOSHi Matthew and All,
I was about to write the list on this, and sounds like you are spot-on.
She worked with someone at FS this morning, who did an Outlook repair and it fixed the problem.
Strange though that the problem was evident in Jaws, but not in NVDA.
GlennOops, here's an update, looks like there is still a problem,
My friend writes:
I called Freedom Scientific and they did delete something that ws corrupted in outlook. They only partially fixed the problem but now I can't even proofread my own messages for spelling mistakes or something like that. Now I'm more frustr4ated than ever! I'm ready to give up jaws and go badck to NVDA.
 Hi,  Sounds like a repair of jaws maybe in order.



MatthewWow, you are thinking like me.
I gave her the instructions to do that this morning, after I sent my last message.
I don't know if she has gotten it done yet though.

cannot reinstall either version of jaws/says installation failed 5 messages,"Since the repair instructions are way hard to understand, Jaws is in need of a reinstall.

JoanneHi Joanne,
 
Pressing enter on the Jaws .EXE file should bring up the option to repair.  Make sure you press enter on the same .EXE file as the version of Jaws you're running.  I just tried this and after saying, Yes, on the, Do you want to run..., the, Repair, button was highlighted.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.I had the same problem back in June. The Jaws tecnician ran the repair and blew my computer out of the water. I had to contact a second Jaws technician who spent 2 days to finally get Jaws to reinstall. He had to remove all Jaws links out of the registry, twice before Jaws would re-install. The problem was that when the first technician did the Jaws repair it put two copies of Jaws 2019 in the computer.It would be interesting and helpful if folks mentioned whether they updated Jaws from the update or from the stand-alone installer downloaded from FS.
Because I still wonder if updating through the update link can do strange things to Jaws.
GlennThe biggest problem with trying to re-install Jaws 2019 happened after we downloaded the program from the FS site and ran the repair. That’s when I found the duplicate Jaws2019 .EXE file in my program list.

There doesn't seem much need to use Open office to perform a task that the operating system itself provides.
Assuming all you want to do is create a new folder on your system, say, inside your documents folder/library.
What I would do:
Hit windows key +r to open the run dialog box from anywhere in Windows.

Type ""documents"" without the quote
You will now be in your documents folder.
Hit ctrl-shift-n to create a new folder.

decTalk speak windows with jaws,"Hi
I figured it out. I guess those decTalk speak windows use an older accessibility method. So I had to turn the old accessibility driver on, and then jaws saw the graphics I was looking for. It’s a good thing jaws kept the older accessibility driver method for those programs that need it. So by turning it on now I can successfully click the graphics in the decTalk speak window demo players. I sure wish they would bring back decTalk access32 for jaws. Because if jaws used decTalk access32 to its full potential, then we could assign different tone sounds including touch tone combinations to certain jaws events. DecTalk is very lite and responsive, not sure why Freedom Scientific decided to get rid of it. I have a sapi5 version of decTalk that works ok with jaws, but it really needs updating because the sapi5 decTalk is not very responsive. Its responsiveness has to be improved in order to work good with the latest jaws 2019.

I am almost out of storage space and have lots of Gmail to get rid of.  Deleting it from Outlook doesn’t seem to affect the Gmail client itself.  How do I go about selecting and deleting large quantities of Gmail?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Is your e-mail client pop3 or imap?  If imap, your e-mail should come right off the server when deleting from Outlook, etc.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Hi Sherri,
Outlook may have a setting, if you are using POP, to delete deleted items from server in the advanced tab.
If not, on the web page, you will check the messages that you want to delete, as they should have a check box by them, make sure whether you are checking the message above or below the check box, you can tell if the first message has a check box above it or below it.
You can move from check box to check box with the letter X.
At the bottom of the list of messages for the page, you should find an action, like move or delete.
It will affect only the messages you have checked.
It's been a while since I've done this, but it will be similar if not just like this.
HTH.
GlennHi Sherri,
 
Now that I am retired I don't use Outlook, but i seem to recall that in the Email preferences you have the choice to leave mail on the server, or to delete it from the server when it is downloaded.  Make sure that you don't have the ""leave messages on server"" box checked.
 
AndyHello.
 
Judy is correct, but my g-mail account contains a file called “all mail” which seems to consist of an archive containing e-mails whether or not I have deleted them in Outlook.
 
I’d like to know how to clear out that file, and also how to safely delete out-of-date miles in my sent file on the g-mail web site.
 
Tom BehlerI don’t pay much attention to the All Mail, but I believe it contains e-mails from all your different boxes, unless you have deleted them.  It would seem safer to delete from your other boxes, in case you accidentally deleted something in the All Mail folder you wanted to keep.
 
I never delete my SentBox, as that is my record of e-mails that I hang on to.  I always did that at work too, and was very grateful, as I could always pull up and resend  an e-mail if someone said they didn’t receive what I had sent.  I’ll delete anything else except my sent mail.
 
Judy
“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”Yeah, eMails are literally a drop in the buck in terms of space on the hard drive, unless they have attachments, like audio files.
But the space of saving plain old messages is really nothing.
Folks can search for messages in their eMail client and make the criteria that they are looking for messages with attachments, and when it finds them, you can select any number of them and delete them in one keystroke.
In most clients, shift + delete permanently deletes them.
GlennHi Sherri,
 
I use the steps below to delete large numbers of email, but the steps below are for Basic HTML view and if you're using the Standard view I don't know
if they'll work.
 
From: Bill White
There is no ""Select All"" checkbox in basic html view in gmail. Here's what I
do to delete large numbers of messages in gmail.
 
How to create a filter in your gmail account which will delete large groups
of messages in your inbox.
 
1.  Sign into your gmail account using Internet Explorer.
 
2.  Press Insert+F7 to open the links list.
 
3.  Press the letter S until you hear Settings, then press Enter.
 
4.  Press Insert+F7 to open the links list again.
 
5.  Press the letter C until you hear Create a filter, and then press Enter.
 
6.  Press the letter F until you hear From: Edit.
 
7.  In this field, type *@*
 
8.  Press Tab until you hear: Next Step Button and press the space bar.
 
9.  When the next page loads, press the letter X until you hear: Delete it
Check Box Not Checked. Press the space bar to check this item.
 
10. Press the letter X until you hear: Also apply filter to 20 conversations
below Check Box Not Checked, and press the space bar to check this item.
 
11. Press Tab until you hear: Create Filter Button, and press the space bar.
Your filter should now be created.
 
12. After your filter is created, press Insert+F7, then the letter I to be
taken back to your inbox where you will see all of your messages still there
in your inbox.
 
13. Close Internet Explorer to exit out of the gmail web page.
 
14. Sign into your gmail account using Internet Explorer again.
 
15. Go to your inbox, where you should see that it is empty.
 
16. Press Insert+F7 to open the links list.
 
17. Press the letter S until you hear Settings, then press Enter.
 
18. Press F7 for the links list, then press the letter F until you hear
Filters, and press Enter.
 
19. Press the letter B until you hear: Delete It Button. Press the space
bar.
 
20. When the page loads, you will hear JAWS say:   Your filter has been
deleted.
 
21. Be sure to do steps 14 through 18, or all of your e-mail will continue
to be deleted and sent to the trash.

I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.Hi Again Sherri,
 
I found steps to remove messages for Standard view if you're using it and not the Basic HTML view.
From: Philip Hall
Here is a method of removing all messages from a gmail account using the standard view.
 
I would appreciate if someone would  try out the steps and let me know if I missed anything.
 
I created this using Jaws 18.
 
Good luck
 
1. Open your Gmail account and make sure you are in standard view.
 
2. press h until you get to labels
3. Press the letter b once to get to the more button.
 
4. Press enter twice.
The first time you press enter, jaws will say less.
 
Press enter one more time.
This should add additional links to the labels area.
 
5. Now, arrow down until jaws says
Trash.
 
6. Press enter to take you to the list of trash emails.
 
7. Press the letter t to jump to the table of trash messages.
 
8. Press up arrow to the empty trash button, or press 
Shift b to move up to the empty trash button.
 
9. Press enter.
A new page will open asking you to 
Confirm deleting messages
 
10. Press b to bring focus to the ok button or down arrow to the button.
 
Using jaws, for some reason, pressing enter or space on the ok button doesn't activate it.
 
11. If using jaws, turn off quick navigation keys by pressing 
Jaws key + the letter z.
 
Press enter to activate the ok button.
 
You can now turn on quick navigation keys again by pressing
Jaws key + z.
 
All your messages will be deleted.
Phil

I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.I guess I could simply keep my all-mail folder as long as it doesn’t get too big, although I suspect that will happen at some point down the road.
 
Tom BehlerIn the case of my folder I wanted to delete, it not only deleted the e-mails, but the folder as well, which was fine, but certain other folders, I would just like to delete their e-mails.  Thank you for the tips.  Now I just have to remember how to get back to standard view.  I have a difficult time navigating in the HTML view.
 
SherriThis is great—a little scary—but great!  Thank you.
 
SherriThank you Judy.  That is a great suggestion!
 
SherriI honestly do not like Outlook.  I’ll have to try to find out where preferences is and then make that change.
 
Thank you.
 
SherriIt’s set up as IMAP.  It downloads to both my phone and my computer.
 
SherriThat might be true, but I’ve had mine for almost six years and doesn’t seem to be feeling any pain.
 
From time to time, I do delete my trash folder, and that’s what’s probably keeping me afloat.
 
Just for grins and giggles I looked at my oldest All Mail and it is back from November 14, 2015, so you are right, deleting from an Outlook inbox or the trash folder does not mean deleting from All Mail.
 
My sent mail doesn’t even go back that far, to September 2016.  Very interesting.

do you think this problem is a result of latest update or sound card issue 4 messages,"I don't know how well I'll explain this but I'll try. It's rather complex and something I just haven't run across before; and too many times I've had to restart by using the button on computer because with Jaws acting this way I can't shut down or restart using Jaws. Not sure it is an issue with the latest update, but it started happening after installing it. I'll be doing just fine for awhile and then all of a sudden there'll be this pop-up from Jaws and no alt-tabbing will get me out of it. It says ""this feature can only be used in tandem,"" and I'm not using tandem at the time and haven't used it in a long time. I attempt to restart Jaws and it says jaws 40 minute mode and that ""this feature"" message won't go away. It acts like the jaws key is locked by the way typed characters are shown. And it makes this click noise upon spacing. I can't restart it without this limited speech, so I use the button and it goes back to normal for awhile.
 
The reason I wonder if Jaws doesn't like the sound card anymore is I'm now afraid to play music while working with jaws because I don't know if the sound card doesn't like my doing 2 things at once and that's why that strange message. I did make sure ""allow wave files"" was checked but just don't know what's causing this craziness. I don't know if a restore will help. I'm very open to ideas.
 
Thanks.
 
JoanneHi Joanne,
Did you run the update through the Jaws prompt, or did you download the updater file and launch the file?
If the latter, did you run it as administrator?
If the former, try downloading the update file, run as administrator via the applications key, and try doing a repair, which will be an option.
HTH.
GlennThat's strange.
 
First, I'd try a Jaws repair.  I'm not sure what is generating that tandem message you're getting.
 
Second, part of this issue sounds like some type of lock-up is occurring.  Have you run a good anti-virus and anti-malware scan recently? 
 
Does your hardware check out properly, i.e. is all your memory working properly?  Often, application dumps or freezes are a result of a memory problem.
 
I don't know if Narrator talks if you choose to do the memory check procedure as outlined below, otherwise, you'll need a pair of eyes or Aira to assist you:
 
https://www.windowscentral.com/how-check-your-pc-memory-problems-windows-10
 Hey.
 
This is interesting.
 
Sorry for the snark in advance, but isn’t Aira just a remote pair of eyes? :P
 
I’d be interested to know if there is a command line alternative to mdsched to bypass the gui entirely. I never ran this before myself; I just checked and it appears it has no command line switches and can’t be run without the interface. But maybe there is something else. That said, it shouldn’t be hard to just let the test run without speech (I doubt narrator will work here, but hey, maybe, give it a try) and then check results in event viewer.
Would still seem more efficient to me to just decide what you want, execute some command line switches and then have the results dumped into a text file. But hey…
 
Also note that if a memory stick registers ashaving “issues”, it might be something as simple as it having become slightly unseated, or some dirt got in there. Yes, it sounds stupid, but this happened once to my last PC. I was having inexplicable memory faults every so often for a while that would cause a system halt. Then one day the computer simply would not boot, giving me a steady beeping sound instead. So my ex and I opened up the case, gently cleaned around all the modules (it was a bit dusty in there as I recall!), and made sure everything was snugly in place. System booted perfectly after that.
 
But yeah, this may be a completely different problem.

excel row's and column reading title issue 9 messages,"hello list, i am facing issue of reading row's and column title in excel 2013 with jaws 2019. i even apply the required setting in jaws verbosity but it is still not reading column titles for row's. i believe it is because of new jaws 2019 as i have been using the same excel file . if any of you facing the same issue please do let me know the fix.

thanks in advance.

With best regards,
Faraz q.In the JAWS training materials, there are instructions for making a bookmark to describe row and column titles.  If you use those, you need to be sure that  in quick settings

Title Reading\Workbook, Worksheet and Region Settings\Excel Settings\Define Name Column and Row Titles Override

is turned off.

The JAWS hot key for turning on column settings is
insert+alt+shift+c
and for rows is
insert+alt+shift+r

It's a real finger stretch.

Remember that insert+h while in an application lists the hot keys for the application.

Good luck.Try insert control alt r on your row title and insert control alt c for your column title.Since JAWS 2018, I've found the ins/Alt/control R or c to be only temporary.  It won't hold for me at least when I exit or when I save the spreadsheet.  But it is handy for quick column and row title naming.  More permanent is the way Microsoft set it up in Excel, using that applications key to scroll up (faster than down) to define name.  Click on define name and write titleregion1..(end of the spreadsheet) then either hit enter or tab out to the end and hit OK.  Using this method is permanent once you save the file.  It will hold even if you need to temporarily exite the spreadsheet without closing.  You can also use the ribbon menus under the formula tab to define a name, but the application key is a lot faster.


Additionally, the process works great if you  want to have JAWS read columns and titles of multiple regions (titleregion2..  etc.


Alas, my simple R and C method has givenway to more typing, but at least I don't fret any longer when opening a spreadsheet.


Note: The method I mentioned above should work in Excel 2013, too, though I've not tried it.Thanks for the help. i tried the solution and its work now. a bit more help. i am actually using multiple data region in my work book and wanting to know if i can setup individual row's and column reading settings for each of them ? and how ?
If you use the Excel bookmark function described in the JAWS training materials, yes.  I don't know whether you can have more than one region with the JAWS keys.IYes, you can use the titleregionx to delineate rows and columns in specific regions.  You absolutely must have the title reading override OFF, as the first responder said.  If the titles don't read for you once you've set them up, first suspect the override position in the Excel quick settings.


You dont even have to use title in the name. But, there's one important step you MUST do to get your columns and rows line up as you want them.  You will need to position your cursor on the top left cell before you look for define name and start the naming process.  Insert end will take you to the lower right end of the spreadsheet to give you a view of the size of the whole thing, but if you organize by regions you'll need of course to set up ranges for each region.


Like the golf ball, you'll be a titleist when you mark Excel titles using define name.On 7/4/2019 5:11 AM, Faraz wrote:thanks Jim, I am not Excel savvy person but sometimes i need to do work on excel with multiple regions.

expected jaws behavior 11 messages,"Hello JAWS users:
 
I need some help from the folks on this list as a representative group of “typical” JAWS users.
 
I have been tasked with creating a short class on how to test web pages for accessibility, and I have run into a situation where JAWS is not behaving the way I would have expected, so I want some feedback from other s on how you would expect jaws to behave.
 
I have a webpage with a group of radio buttons on it:
http://donraikes.github.io/htmlex/radiogroup
 
If I jump to the first heading on the page, then tab to the first radio button, depending on the browser sometimes jaws will read the radiogroup label then the radio button value, some times it doesn’t read the label.
The same is true if I go past the radio group and shift-tab back to the last button in the group.
 
Sometimes I can tab through the entire list of buttons in the group sometimes tabbing once takes me into the list then the next tab takes me out of the list altogether.
 
When I use the forms quick navigation sometimes jaws reads the label then the button value sometimes it doesn’t.
 
I would appreciate any opinions/feelings on what jaws should be doing also if anyone is experiencing anything different with this particular webpage.
 
For those techie types, the page contains a form with a fieldset inside of it. The fieldset has a legend and three input tags inside of it to form the radio group.
 
Thanks in advance,
Donald

 Don,
Did you try the letter A for Radio Button?
GlennHi don.
 
I have this page in front of me now. I’m using google chrome with jaws 2019, latest build. I’ve navigated through the radio buttons by tabbing in to them. I’ve also used the letter A to move through the radio buttons, It’s behaving consistently for me. It’s reading Kraken, sasquatch and Mothman, every time.
I can’t get it to misbehave no matter how hard I try.
 Glenn,
 
I always forget that quick key J
 
Using “a” makes JAWS say the label then the radio button value for the first button then just the button value for the remaining buttons which makes sense I suppose.
Going backwards up the page, shift+a reads the label and value for the last button then just the button values for the remainder.
 
Thanks for the suggestion.

Chris,
 
I agree it reads the monster names, but the thing I am trying to figure out is whether and how it should be reading “choose your favorite monster” which is the group label.

 Hi Don:
 
Using JAWS 2019 and Internet Explorer, the page reads fine and all radio buttons are labeled.Yes, I see what you mean.
Pressing the navigation quick key gets you to the radio buttons right away, but in Firefox 68 and JAWS 2018 at least, the “choose your favourite monster” instruction is only read some of the time, and then, only when the buttons are tabbed to. iE, pressing “a” and then arrowing around will not reveal this.
 I tried the below link with three browsers.  I’m using JAWS 2019. 
With Edge, I heard the question, then each time I navigate to a radio button, JAWS is reading all three of the answer choices, but telling me which one I’m on by saying 1 of 3.  This not the behavior I’d want and I do not generally use Edge because of the way radio and checkbox labels are read, among other things.
 
In Internet Explorer, JAWS voices the question and the answer for the radio button I am on.  This can seem most useful to some, however, I have found this behavior very frustrating when doing a survey where the question is quite long.  For.  For example, I might be reading a test question where the scenario is presented then I have to select the answer, but navigating to each answer causes JAWS to re-read the entire scenario.  I think I ended up using the JAWS cursor or something in this case.
 
Google Chrome seems to present the best experience.  I heard the question once, then navigating with quick key A read only the answer.  I liked this best.Hello Don:
 
In my opinion, this has nothing to do with JAWS, but with the DOCTYPE declaration of the webpage.   If you try to replace the top two lines of your webpage with just this:
 
<DOCTYPE html>
 
To indicate that it is an HTML5 page, the current standard, instead of the antiquated HTML 1.0 and xtml, I imagine you would find that the legend would be repeated each time you tab to the next control, as it should, therefore it should be a short legend, and radial choices would be chosen automatically as you down-arrow while on forms mode.
 
hTH,
 
Humberto
.
 Humberto,
 
Interesting catch, but now it is really odd:
 
When none of the radio buttons is selected, jumping to the heading before the radio group then tabbing into the radiogroup causes jaws to read the group label along with the first button’s label tabbing again jaws reads just the button label for the remaining two buttons.
The same kind of behavior is true if I start at the bottom of the page and shift-tab through the radio buttons.
 
If I select the first button, then go back to the top of the page and jump to the heading then tab to the radiogroup, jaws reads the group label then the label for the first button and that it is checked and that there are three buttons.
Tabbing again causes jaws to bypass the remainder of the buttons and go to the browser toolbar.
 
If the second button is selected, then after jumping to the header tabbing once takes me to the first radio button and jaws reads the group label and the button label. Tabbing again takes me to the second button and reads  just the button label and that it is checked. Tabbing again takes my to the browser toolbar bypassing the third button altogether.

Is the one you got USB or bluetooth?
Does Windows see it, or does Jaws just not recognize it?
If the latter is the case, there may be a setting to tell Jaws to use it.
If Windows isn't seeing it, I'd figure out why that is the case.

International Brotherhood of Magicians member #4399Hi. Are you using windows 10? Have you set thunderbird to be your default mail client? If not, here's how.

Go to settings with windows I. Type default apps in to the search field. Arrow down to default apps and press enter. Tab through until you hear the button for default mail client. Press spacebar to activate the button. Tab to Thunderbird and press spacebar to choose thunderbird. Alt f4 to close. Now thunderbird should come up as your default mail client.I believe you have to set your default email account to Thunderbird in Windows settings.
Did you also set Firefox as your default browser?

footnotes in word 2007 (again),"Hi all,
This is a recurring topic I am afraid, but something rather peculiar seems to be happening. When we discussed the showing of footnotes in word and read by jaws, a handy solution was suggested, that is, hitting windows key plus semi-colon, then choosing footnotes. I have been making use of this when they are too long to show on a direct preview it seems, screen. However, no matter how long a volume may be, they stop showing after note213. Most of my working documents have a great deal more notes to review than that, and I have found no way advancing further the appearance of notes. If anyone has stumbled upon such a problem, I would be most grateful for a solution.

Email: mulrich@...Allison,
If you don’t figure this out, you might try the alternative of Shift alt L to bring up a list of spelling issues or Alt F7 to move to mistake to mistake.  I’ve really gotten away from the standard F7 method as of late.
 I didn’t know this command, so thank you.
Alison
 I didn't either, man, where did you get those?
 
those are some good ones.Allison,
I like the Alt Shift L option when I know there are a lot of words that will flag as misspelled, but aren’t.  The dialog gives you a list of what  thinks are mistakes and you can just arrow down past the ones you know are actually correct. When you find one you want to check or correct, hit enter and you’ll be taken right to the word.  Then, you can hist the application key to open a list of correction choices. 
 
Alt F7 moves from mistake to mistake, but it opens the list of corrections for you.  If you know you have odd words that it will flag, then it feels more clunky to me to have to listen the extra JAWS babble before I know the word it’s flagged and then have to hit escape.
 
I use both methods pretty regularly.

I first started noticing this with the recent windows 10 update.
I think its annoying and I want to get rid of the today, last week, two minutes and 35 seconds headers.

http://www.FreedomScientific.com/CertificationHi John,
 
This is because the, Group By, in the View menu needs to be changed.  Try the following:
1. Open your Downloads folder and press, Control + spacebar, to make sure nothing is selected.
2. Press the applications key or Shift + F10 to open the context menu.
3. In the View submenu press enter on, List, or whatever you want from this submenu.
4. Open the context menu again, open the, Sort By submenu, and press enter on, Name, or whatever your choice might be.
5. Open the context menu again, down arrow to the, Group By submenu, and press enter on, None.
That's it, you should be good to go.
 
Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!Hi.  I had the same thing happen after updating to the latest Windows 10
update.  To save time and frustration, I contacted the Microsoft disability
answer desk, the representative remoted into my computers and made the
changes.  This was done after I tried in vain to follow a list member's
instructions to resolve this issue.  This behavior is similar to Outlook.  I
seem to remember that the feature has always been in Windows 10 and was off
by default.  Well, now the annoying feature is on by default.Me to.Thank You!

CherIs the new setting holding?

CherI did follow instruction and works. I closed doc, and reopen again and is history. However I had not restarted my PC so I am not sure until I do so. So far it looks like it works.Hi Cher,

After thinking about what options show in your context menu, I checked and the only way I get those VLC items is because something is selected.  I know you stated that you've made sure nothing is selected but, something is selected in order for those items to show.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!

Once I hit control space very quicly, I saw the menus you mentioned  and was able to fix the problem.
thanks to you, Rebecca and all the others who answered.
this is definitly a response I will save in case it happens again via a windows 10 update.

I agree, as I'm using it too.

I would ask that you stick to statements of a factual nature, and not one of supposition and speculation.

VictorI was using it but when I change my IE provider, I needed to use gmail since they did not provide email. Gmail does not work well in WLM. Now I use outlook and is OK but I prefer WLM.
i have no problem with gmail and wlm in win7 or 10.
but one problem is you have to log on directly to your gmail account and look at the security settings;i think its called and uncheck the option to block less secure programs or it might say email clients. i don't remember.;
then google will stop blocking wlm or thunderbird from accessing your gmail accountsWeird on both machines once I upgraded to win 10, live stopped working.In my case, I'm using wlm 2012 with windows 10 1903 and it works great.It is foolish to say that WLM is dead. There are plenty of us using WLM successfully every day with Win 10.
MarieOnce again, WLM absolutely does work with Gmail and I know because I use it daily. It may not work for you but that does not mean it won't work.
MarieYes. However do not care having to go to google setting and turning off less secure. Today you never know so there. Hope in the future I will find service for IE that gives you email.WLM 2012 was a mess with Windows 7.?? Messages would constatnly get corrupted, rendering them unopenable.?? The program itself sometimes became corrupted and would not download messages from my ISP's server.?? Why would it work any better in Windows 10??? I got so fed up with WLM that I switched to Thunderbird, and I'm glad I did.?? As an added benefit, TB has a classic menu structure, not the confounding and much despised ribbon structure of WLM 2012, and works equally well in Windows 7 or Windows 10.


GeraldIt still works for my wife and me. Honestly this might be considered a moot subject since some folks want to dump the program and many do not. We are all free to make our own choices.I really did not want to dump it. It works great on my win 10 lap top. No matter what I tried I could not get it to work on this new win 10 desk top machine.Thunderbird, is not that great. At all email, outlook is OK but do not care for it. I can not believe there is a good email program better than Thunderbird, outlook, pandora, WLM. Did I miss any?Yes WLM is working fine with gmail. I am still using the 2009 version because the ribbons in 2012 are confusing. I'm glad it does work with gmail because some of the other email programs aren't as accessible to me as this one.

Well I finally gave up on wlm and am converting to Thunderbird. There are
a few problems with Thunderbird that I will address in another email. The
transition was very easy. It brought all of my email and sub folders over
and automatically set up Comcast account . For the most I am pleasantly
pleased some of the problems are trying to use old wlm key combos. I guess
after 10 years these habits are hard to break.--

WLM is here to stay.
RonI too am running the latest version of JAWS, Win 10 and WLM.
I like WLM:
1. Because you can set up message rules and not have everything in your in box.
2. You also can set up sub mailboxes and still have mail go into the mailboxes they're suppose to go in even closed off.
3. The only issue that I'm having with WLM is that it will ship my tag line AKA Signature when I write a letter, but it won't ship it if I ctrl r return to sender, or fw forward a letter.
Yes I have don't send signature with fw or ctrl r is turned off or unchecked, and I do have send signature with all mail checked or turned on.
So, go figure out why I'm having the small issues with WLM.
I've tried the MS mail app twice, the first time I had to roll the clock back, the second time I had them uninstall the program.
I've tried out look and will stay with WLM for now.
RonIt's great that WLM is working for many of you in Windows 10. But just keep in mind that it could suddenly stop working without warning following a future feature update to Windows 10.?? Enjoy it while you can.?? That is another reason why I switched to Thunderbird.?? If Windows 10 changes. TB will be updated to continue to work with it.?? There is no such guarantee with WLM because it is no longer supported, and in fact, you can no longer even access the MS Live Essentials web site to download it.


GeraldYes, you missed good old reliable Eudora. I've been using it since Windows 95 all the way to Windows 10. Its filters are robust, its menus are totally accessible and it works with JAWS. since Qualcom is no longer maintaining Eudora, the last version, 7.1.9, can be downloaded for free and used in paid mode, so that you get no ads and all features are available.

help with win 10 audable app. 2 messages,"Hi guys i would like to down load my brought audable books to my computer.

I googled how to do it  i down loaded the microsoft audable store app.

Jaws works sort of with the app but it says to go to the library find the book and their is a option to down load the book.

I cannot work it out is their a better way.

Cheers Michael.As you've discovered, the Audible app isn't very accessible, although you might try this first: Go to the Audible website on your computer with your preferred browser and follow the link to your library. The books in your library are arranged in a table, so hitting the letter T will take you to that table. Then, you can navigate through the books in your library by hitting the letter G to jump to the book cover graphic for each book. Click on the download link for the book you want to download and see if it will launch the app and download the book. If so, you don't need to try the next step.

If the above doesn't work, then you need to uninstall the app and go to the Audible website and download the Audible Download Manager. You find this program by choosing the link to download Audible for an older computer. Audible will recognize that your running Windows 10, but there's a link on that page that will take you to a page where you can download the Audible Download Manager. Unless you want to listen to books on your computer, you don't need to download the Audible Manager, only the Audible Download Manager. Once you've installed the Audible Download Manager, you can use the steps above to download books from your library through the Audible website.

Hope this helps.

MiriamOffice 365 should be the most up to date version, unless they've changed how you get updates, and to my knowledge, they have not, so you shouldn't worry if it's current or not.

VictorHi. Microsoft does issue monthly updates to Office 365. Here is a quick way to check for Office updates.



1. Open an Office app, such as Word.

2. Press alt-F for what Microsoft calls the backstage view or what we still think of as the file menu.

3. Press D for Account.

how to change jaws voice parameters on the fly 5 messages,"Hi everyone,
Hope everyones’ having a good week thus far. I already know that in order to adjust the rate in Jaws on the fly, the command is control plus ault plus either page up or page down, to make the voice speak slower or faster. However, I can’t remember how to change the pitch and/or volume on the fly, without having to have to go into the options dialog all the time. Are there commands for doing this? Thanks.
Mike
 
Do you like disco? Do you like to shake your groove with New Wave, 90s Hiphop, Or today’s slammin hits? If so, check out my show every Wednesday night from 7 to 9 pm Eastern on ACB Radio Interactive at
www.acbradio.org/interactiveYou need to assign hotkeys for that within the keyboard manager in
jaws manager.Hello. To change the rate of speech and have those settings preserved you can press ctrl-alt-Windows along with page-up or page-down. 

I believe that Keyboard Manager may include some unassigned shortcut keys to perform settings for pitch and volume but I have not explored these functions in any real detail.

David Goldfield, Assistive Technology Specialist WWW.David-Goldfield.ComWherre in jaws would I find that?
MikeHi Mike,
Insert + F2, then the letter ""K"" and hit enter.
Or Insert + J, for jaws menu, then open the utilities sub menu, then
the letter ""K"" for the keyboard manager.
BTW, its a bit advanced to change or assign new hotkeys, so better to
backup your current settings from the import export sub menu within
the utilities sub menu before making new changes, encase if you didn't
know how to revert them.

how to get mazilla thunderbird to tell me there is an attachment in A message when looking threw my messages in my inbox 11 messages,"In my opinion there need to bee good scripts written for thunderbird like for Outlook.  I don't think you can get it to automatically tell you.I once had this problem in one of the eMail programs I have used, might have been OE.
What I did was to find the graphic number that was different when I arrowed over the message, and route the Jaws cursor to that number, you want it right on the number.
All the non-attachment messages will say graphic something and the one with the attachment will have a graphic different number.
So when the Jaws cursor is there, do insert + G and that will bring up the graphics editor.
It is just like the dictionary manager, it asks you to enter something for the graphic.
I just put in the word attachment.
So instead of hearing it say graphic 204 or whatever number it is, it will say attachment.

I would just route the Jaws to the PC when you are on top of the graphic, or in the example I gave, on top of the closed eMail message.
Then use the number pad to move the Jaws cursor, or the jaws navigation keys like Jaws key and J K L to to move the jaws cursor.
Stop on the graphic number that is representing what needs to be labeled and then do Insert + G to label the graphic.

Hello ,



I'v never installed a plug-in. I think the attachments  are already there. What I needed to do is have a sighted person re-order the headers and place the attachment  column at the beginning before the from field. I know we can drag and drop with jaws but it's a pain. Re-ordering the columns were alot easier with outlook express and maybe some others.



Gary
Hi so how to you arrange the columns with Jaws in thunderbird?

CaseyThe best way that I have found is to get a sighted person to drag and drop them in the order that you want. I  call microsoft accessibility and let them do it. A sighted person can do it  in  less than 2 minutes. As I said, I know we  have a method with jaws to drag and drop but it's not easy. I wish there was an ottion in thunderbird in the view menu to choose  the columns you want and also arrange them the way you want. If there is I can't find it.



I like the columns in this order.

1 attachment

2. from

3. subject

4. date and time

Hi Gary & All,
 
Have you tried these steps in the past?
 
From: adam morris
 
Columns & Headings, How To Fix The Mouse Cursor Problem
 
see below how to do this and more with Jaws and NVDA.
 
These are the three steps needed to fix the mouse cursor problem.
 
The third step is the new one.  You do have to arrow down many times to find it.  A lot do seem to sound the same, so be careful you get the correct one
 
to change:
 
1. Open the Configuration Editor. In Firefox, enter
 
about:config
 
 in the address bar. In Thunderbird, go to the Tools menu and navigate to Options, Advanced, General, then Config Editor.
 
2. Once in the Configuration editor, press TAB until you are in the list of options.
 
3. Pressing UP or DOWN ARROW will move you between options or typing the first few letters of an option's name will move you to a specific option in the
list.
 
the following are entries to search for:
 
 
gfx.direct2d.disabled
 
if the boolean value is set to false, press the enter key to toggle the value to true.
 
 
layers.acceleration.disabled
 
if the boolean value is set to false, press the enter key to toggle the
 
value to true.
 
 
layers.offmainthreadcomposition.enabled
 
if the boolean value is set to true, press the enter key to toggle the
 
value to false.
 
press control+w to close the configuration window.
 
restart Thunderbird/Firefox.
 
Column presentation
 
Go to the message list.
 
go to the very top of it with the home key.
 
enable touch cursor,
 
now go left until you hear select columns to display... button.
 
Press enter. This opens the menu allowing you to check and uncheck columns.
 
If you want to rearrange the columns, go left past that button and you'll find the header items like subject and the like. Find the one you want to move,
 
press the keystroke to lock mouse button, with laptop layout that would be shift caps lock num row 8. then left or right to the colum you'd like to place
 
this before and press the mouse lock toggle again. Note that the columns are read in the same order regardless of their actual position when using touch
 
cursor. You'll have to try to move it, then go back to pc cursor and navigate the list of messages to see if you did it. If it fails, try dragging other
 
columns around the one want to move instead and see if that works. It's a bit messy but can be done with a little time and a big dose of patients.
 
Once you have a folder set up, you may want to assign that folder's column view settings to all folders, this is available in that button that says choose
 
which columns to display near the bottom says something like apply to folder, you can apply it to your entire email account that way if you want to.
 
 
Editing spelling dictionary
 
 
In the profile directory there is a file persdict.dat. You can edit that with notepad and remove any words. You need to restart Thunderbird to affect the
 
changes.
 
 
Editing spelling dictionary.
 
 
Open a new message.
 
Check spelling.
 
Tab to edit,
 
Then you will find the dictionary,
 
Tab to remove.

how to remove avast 17 messages,"Hi, Avast got installed along with CCleaner how do I remove the thing?  Help is appreciated.Hi:
 
Avast has a removal tool, you are supposed to run the tool in safe mode.
When avast was on my computer I ran the tool anyway and it removed Avast.
I am just sharing what I did.
In safee mode there is know speech.
Have a good day.really?? i tried several times and it just sat there doing nothing.? i had to have a sighted person remove it for me.? next time i try i will go into safe mode first and see what happens.


StewThere is a registry patch for 7 and XP to have audio in safe mode, and I have heard that 10 gives audio in safe mode.
I have had a video error from Jaws in safe mode, but it still works for the basic things.
 
GlennThe Avast removal tool used to be accessible, but the last 2 times I tried to use it, it didn't work like it did in the past.  I needed for my wife to do the removal for me.  Below are the steps for when it was accessible if you want to try them.  Read the steps thoroughly first.  Also, below is the direct download link for the tool.
 
http://files.avast.com/iavs9x/avastclear.exe
 
1. Press enter on the, AvastClear, .EXE file.
2. You will get the following message:
 
Avast Antivirus Clear
It is recommended to run this tool from Windows Safe Mode. 
Do you want to do that?
Press ""Yes"" to reboot into Safe Mode now and run this tool 
from there.
Press ""No"" to continue running this tool as it is (not 
recommended).
Yes No
3. Tab to the, No button, & press enter or spacebar.  Now press the spacebar on the, Uninstall button, to start the uninstall process as Administrator.  After Avast is uninstalled you should get a prompt to restart the computer.  When the computer reboots you can check to see if any remnants of the program are left behind.  The 1 time I used this removal tool the only remnant I found left behind was an Avast folder in the Program Files, & Program Data folders on the root of the C drive, but I did not check the registry.

No one has more to say than the woman who says she doesn't want to talk about it. I had Avast years ago, and I don’t know if this has changed, but one used to have to go into safe mode in order to get it out.  I had to have sighted assistance.  I went to Best Buy, and they got it off, but have decided not to use it again, for that reason.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”That’s wonderful if audio will kick in in safe mode.  I think I had Windows Vista when trying to remove Avast.  I would be afraid to get in safe mode and not be able to get back out again, but that’s just my lack of knowledge showing.

“Embrace the day with its mercies and blessings.”I got it removed.  I called the Microsoft Disability answer desk.This is what you get for installing c cleaner and other  so called apps like
this which get their revenues by installing other shady crap on to your
system.Not really, it's what you get for not being careful during the installation process.  Many sites or programs have some cost-deferral arrangements with commercial vendors to help defray costs of their programs, particularly free ones, so there are checkboxes by default that are checked on many download sites.

When you are going through the process, you need to verify that you only have the box checked for the program you want; otherwise, you will install unwanted programs like this anti-virus program, or google toolbars, etc.

SteveJAWS does not recognize the check box in the standard CCleaner install dialog that causes Avast to be installed by default. Neither does Unchecky.?? The only sure way to prevent Avast from being installed along with CCleaner is to install the slim version of CCleaner, which does not come with any other unwanted software:

 Is there a way to put in your registration information into the slim version?  How do you get into the browser monitoring and tell it what to delete for what browser?

I'm not going to be very exact, but maybe close!  LOL  First, I don't have a clue as how to register their Pro version, but I wouldn't waste my money on their Pro version.

CherThe key command insert + A will read the address.
If you do that, does it sound like the URL that you activated?
Also, what happens if you list links?
That one insert + F7
I have found when pages do this, listing links and escaping from the links list works.
It usually deposits Jaws at the bottom of the page, so you may need to do control + Home to get back to the top.
HTH.

 As I hear the JAWS key identifier, which I bring up with JAWS key+1, the JAWS key+escape command “repaints all currently displayed items on the screen.” It seems to be a kind of reset. I often find that pressing this command after having already pressed F5 gives me the best results for displaying and navigating a webpage.I use alt-D for address- and the blank page is the one I linked to.
When Chrome quits responding, there are never any links as far as I remember.
 
As I said, Chrome very often quits responding when I hit a form field and auto forms is checked. Don’t yet know whether changing forms to manual will reduce or resolve the freezing.
 
CherI’ll give it a whirl- thanks for the idea.

jaws & outlook2016 6 messages,"Good morning listers.
does anyone happen to know how to move contacts from one folder to another?
 
One of my clients had a friend help him upgrade his office 2007 to office 2016.
unfortunately, through the process, the program created another contact folder.
he now has 3 folders.
his gmail account contact folder, a contacts folder, and the newly created one. is there a way to move contacts to the gmail, or, contact folder?
 
in advance, thanks for the help.
 
 
       The impossible is the untried,  Never under estimate the power of a dream.I have not tried it, but I would think you could simply go into one contact folder, do a Control A to select all then copy into the desired folder.  Outlook is usually pretty straight forward with that kind of thing.That’s correct- it’s a simple copy and paste. If control-A does not work for any reason, hold down the shift key and press the end key to select all or select the ones you want with control-space and paste only those entries.
 
CherHello;
ok, within office 2016,
I tried the following;
 
1, opened outlook,
2, pressed ctrl+shift+b=book,
3, tab until I get to the combo box,
now choose the addressbook/folder where the contacts are currently, so, in the list of contacts, I highlight one, copy to clipboard, tab back to the combo box, find the correct folder, tab and I see there's 0 contacts, so I paste, and nothing happens.
so, the copy paste does not work.
I tested this on my own machine.
 
 
 
       The impossible is the untried,  Never under estimate the power of a dream.I would not do it in Outlook.
Contacts is a folder in users\username\.
I would copy it or any contacts from there.
GlennI just did the following approach successfully within Outlook 2016.   Go to the contacts folder  where the contacts you want to move are. You can do this in a number of ways. I used Control Y to open the list of folder and arrowed down to the my main email account then to Contacts.  This is a tree view, so you may need to right arrow to open the list of folders under the account.
 
You’ll be placed on the first contact in your folder.  Hit Control A to select all.  Then hit Control C or Control X to copy or cut respectively.
 
Use Control Y to open the folder list again and navigate to the contact folder where you want to place the contacts.  Again, you may have to right arrow to open a tree view to see the next contacts folder. 
 
Once you’ve landed in the Contracts folder, hit Control V to paste the contacts.  I just did this with 3 contacts from my main email account and place them into a different account’s contacts.
 
I never use that Control Shift B method to access my contacts.  I’ll have to see what advance that gives, but it’s not even on my radar to use it.  It’s providing a list of contact, but it is not the kind of list you can copy from. 
 
Generally, you can use Control 3 to go to your contacts for the given email account.

jaws problem with thunderbird,"I suspect that this is a jaws 19 problem. I am using the latest version. Anyway on an open email I wanted to add the sender to my address book. There is a button that states press space bar to add to address book. Using either the space bar or enter on this button nothing happens. I do not have jaws 18 installed on this machine to check it out. Any suggestions? thanks

jaws with SoftVoice willowPond tts,"
Hi,
A while ago I wrote to the author of SoftVoice willowpond tts asking if it is ok and legal to use it with screen readers. He said yes. So my question is this… Since an addon already exists to use the multilingual softVoice willowPond tts with NVDA… Therefore can freedom scientific please add willowPond or SoftVoice tts as a jaws voice or jaws speech synthesizer? This would give jaws novelty voices and some other very responsive voices for people to use.

jaws with decTalk access32 and speak-windows? 9 messages,"Hi,Does the latest jaws still work with the decTalk access32 speech synthesizer?
And also, I have several decTalk speak windows. These are notepad-type applications with built in decTalk so you can make it sing and stuff. Anyway using the jaws cursor on windows 10 32bit I cannot see the graphics for the play button and other controls with the jaws cursor. These speak windows came out around 1996 or so. The only one whose edit box works is the version 4.3 decTalk speak window.
 
 
Sent from Mail for Windows 10Hi Josh,
 
I can't answer your question about the decTalk synthesizer, but as far as the graphics, make sure your settings are set to read labeled graphics.  If you're settings are set to read labeled graphics you'll then have label the graphics yourself, Jaws does have this ability.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look astonished!Hi, Are you saying that you actually got Access 32 to work on a Win 10 computer? 
 
If yes, would you tell us how you did it?
 
Sincerely, Vicky Vno, I only got the decTalk speak-window notePad apps to work on a windows10 computer. With those, you can make decTalk sing. Just do a google search for decTalk flameOfHope and you will find them. I wished you could still get Dectalk for jaws.what would be best is if CodeFactory sold a sapi5 version of decTalk access-32, using decTalk 4.3 or 4.2 software since that decTalk version is the best. Has anyone ask CodeFactory about selling Dectalk?I asked codeFactory about decTalk several years ago and they said there probably would not be enough demand for it. But that was back in 2013 or so. Maybe if we all contact codeFactory about selling decTalk we could get it accomplished? 

JoshOr maybe putting the code into the public domain for anyone to make it accessible.  They didn’t seem to be willing to do this several years ago but might be willing to do it now.

jaws with older programs like decTalk speak-windows,"Hi again,
I tried an experiment. I wanted to see if the jaws touch cursor worked with the old decTalk for windows95 speak window demo application. Well it partially works. I can control the rate, but selecting voices is a problem. So the best method for using such old programs is to turn the accessibility driver to on, in miscellaneous in your default jaws configuration file or make a new jaws configuration for the old program and in that configuration make sure the accessibility driver is turned on, that way jaws can see the graphics with the jaws cursor and therefore they can be labeled if you wish. So, no, I do not recommend the jaws touch cursor for the old decTalk speak window applications. The legacy accessibility driver works best. Now if we could have DecTalk access32, softVoice tts, and Orpheus with a jaws sam driver that would be excellent.

Its in 2 parts, they are:
the 1st is: decrease voice volume none.
the 2nd is: increase voice volume none.
""None"" means no command assignedHi Robin,
 
See if the steps below will work for you:
Below are 2 different sets of steps for creating volume level keystrokes: 
 
1. Open Keyboard Manager  without any applications / programs open to make sure you land on, Default, when  you open Keyboard Manager.  Do this by pressing,
Jaws key + F2, press the  letter, K, until you have Keyboard Manager highlighted, & press enter.   If you don't have, Default, highlighted when opening
the keyboard manager press  the letter, D, until you do.
 
2. Find the following to  assign keystrokes to them:
DecreaseSystemVolume,  None
 
DecreaseVoiceVolume,  None
IncreaseSystemVolume,  None
 
IncreaseVoiceVolume,  None
*Note:   None,  means that there is not a keystroke assigned to these functions /  tasks.
 
3. On each of these  functions / tasks press, Control + A, to open an edit field to insert the  keystroke you would like to use for this particular function
/ task.   *Note:  Make sure not to press any other keys other than the keystroke you  want!
4. After entering your  desired keystroke tab one time, and there's a checkbox for assigning this  keystroke to desktop keys only, usually people will
uncheck this.
 
5. Tab to, Okay, Press  ENTER, and choose OK in the confirmation dialog which appears.
6.  You'll be  returned to the list view of scripts.  Use the same steps with the  other functions / tasks listed above.
7. Close Keyboard  Manager with, Alt + F4.
 
Take care.  Mike.  Go Dodgers!
 
Steps #2 that I haven't tried With either Windows 7 or 10, but supposedly work:
From: Richard 
I found this on the Microsoft Answer page from Googling the question.  I did it and named it, creatively enough, volume, and assigned control+alt+v, which
gets  you to the master volume control on my Windows 10 Home system.
 
Then, alt+x gets you to the mixer controls where you can adjust programs separately, supposedly. 
 
Here is what I found:
 
Yes,you can create a Master Volume Shortcut and also assign a Shortcut Key.
 
Right click on a empty area on desktop, and click on New and Shortcut.
 
Paste the following in to the location of the item area:- 
 
%windir%\System32\SndVol.exe -f 49825268 
 
Click Next button and give a name to the Shortcut and click Finish. 
 
Now You right click on it and select Properties. 
 
Click Shortcut tab. 
 
Assign your desired shortcut key like F8 or F9 in the Shortcut Key area. 
 
Click OK/Apply. 
 
HTH,

Hello all,

I'm following  the steps below to assign keystrokes to volume increase and decrease. The new keystrokes do announce louder and softer but don't actually perform the function. Here are the keystrokes I'm using. Control Shift page up to increase and control shift page down to  make it softer. Any idea why they don't work?

increase to control+alt+equals.

pressing,
Jaws key + F2, press the  letter, K, until you have Keyboard Manager 
highlighted, & press enter.   If you don't have, Default, highlighted when 
opening
the keyboard manager press  the letter, D, until you do.
 
2. Find the following to  assign keystrokes to them:
DecreaseSystemVolume,  None
 
DecreaseVoiceVolume,  None
IncreaseSystemVolume,  None
 
IncreaseVoiceVolume,  None
*Note:   None,  means that there is not a keystroke assigned to these 
functions /  tasks.
 
3. On each of these  functions / tasks press, Control + A, to open an edit 
field to insert the  keystroke you would like to use for this particular 
function

5. Tab to, Okay, Press  ENTER, and choose OK in the confirmation dialog

6.  You'll be  returned to the list view of scripts.  Use the same steps 
with the  other functions / tasks listed above.
7. Close Keyboard  Manager with, Alt + F4.
Thanks,

From: netbat66
it may need to be defined in the keyboard manager.
if you want the changes for all scripts make sure the default keyboard 
script
is loaded. then changes will apply to all the program scripts.
search for increase and decrease volume.
there are also options to increase and decrease rate in the same place. but
these are undefined.

Yes,you can create a Master Volume Shortcut and also assign a Shortcut Key.

Right click on a empty area on desktop, and click on New and Shortcut.

Paste the following in to the location of the item area:-

%windir%\System32\SndVol.exe -f 49825268

Click Next button and give a name to the Shortcut and click Finish.

Now You right click on it and select Properties.

Click Shortcut tab.

Assign your desired shortcut key like F8 or F9 in the Shortcut Key area.

Click OK/Apply.

I usually tab to it, sometimes arrowing it doesn't always work, and I use the applications key and enter on something like save target as, or save link as.

long delay in JAWS reading Directory structure when saving or sending files,"Hi. I’m using W-10 and the latest JAWS. I’m having this really annoying problem that didn’t happen in Windows-7. When I’m in outlook or Word, each time I want to send or save a file, it takes perhaps 30 seconds for JaWS to read the directories.
For example: This morning I wanted to save a copy of my morning’s Washington Post sent to me from NFB in an e-mail. In outlook, when I’m on the message, I go to file and save attachments and press enter twice (to save the attachments and save all attachments). Then I wait. And wait. My expected behavior is to shift-tab back to see the directories so I can select the correct directory to save the files. But JAWS doesn’t read anything; it is silent. After about 20-30 seconds, I can finally hear the directories, pick one and save the files.
This happens when I try to send  a file or save a file in Word. What’s going on? Why is there this delay?
And how can I stop it?
It’s driving me crazy!

To be fair I'm trying to think what PC I've seen this most on. I don't have a brand spanking new out of box PC so I don't wana jump right away on FS. It's true NVDA doesn't exactly do this. But than again NVDA doesn't do lots of things. like when you hit the like button on a youtube video it's not all talky and stuff. It just says space as you hit than added to liked videos or it says nothing if you unliked the vid. There's all kinds of stuff like that. But yes I've seen this lost focus thing more and more but for a while back now. Again I wana be fair I don't have a brand spanking new PC so could be that the PCS are old. But if indeed it is a JAWS issue than yes something needs to be done.

I am using Windows 10 current and to let you know. This has always been a problem with jaws. I do not understand why this can not be address. Now if this is not a jaws issue, they need to let us know.Understood. Now when you say this has always been a problem how far back do you remmember this happening? Again I just wanted to be fair as my PCs aren't exactly new. So figured it was a processing issue. But perhaps I'm wrong. If someone with a brand new PC is seeing this let us know. Because then 1 can be dam sure it's JAWS. There's lots of funny things JAWS is doing but again I don't wana judge right away as the small laptop I have that I bought in 2016 is itself being kinda strange and I'm not convenced it is truely new. Again though I have seen this issue especially comeing out of folders or shutting down software but always assumed it's a the PC is kinda confused kinda issue.For more than 9 years.Oh wow okay. It happens to you constantly? Because I've seen it happen but here and there. But yeah I'm surprised they haven't done something. I never meantioned it to Erick because I again always thought the PCs were confused when it happened. Guess I was wrong than.If I am doing something and I open a program and leave my PC for a while when I do insert t tells me lost focus. Even if I am using a program tends to go to lost focus. If I leave my PC on desk top and come back it says lost focus and I need to use windows M to go back.Yeah that's real bad. I've seen it that bad but see it's been on a PC that's from 2007. So to be expected I always thought. Also on a laptop from 2011. So again I thought to be expected. But if your machine isn't that old than something is dephinetly wrong. Now I should later try NVDA on that old 2007 Enspiron 530S and see. I have used NVDA on it before but not much. I don't like that robot E Speak voice. But I should try and see what happens.I upgrated my PC. It has a TV/monitor for my PC. When I am not using the TV, I can change it to a flat screen. Nice side. Also my PC was updated 3 years ago.if by updated you mean new hardware or you completely blew Windows away than yeah something's up with JFW than. Especially if that HDD or SSD is new. I don't know man. Have you told FS about this? Because again especially if this is fresh hardware this shouldn't be. I've seen this as bad as you describe but like I said on an old Enspiron 530 S from 2007. Which at the moment has Windows 8 on it by the way.I had put Windows 7 on it before.HI Holger,
 
It sounds like you have something going on in the background that's causing the focus loss issue.  I don't have this problem with any version of Jaws I have installed on my Windows 7 or 10 computers.

Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!
I believe that everything happens for a reason. Usually, the reason is that somebody screwed up.New hardware even a new wireless keyboard.This has always been a problem with windows seven and now 10.Alright yeah this is real serious than. I mean this than is practicaly a new PC. I'd call FX.I have this issue with the latest win 10 pro, and latest jaws.  And it has been doing this for several versions of jaws and windowsI agree that FS should devote more resource to fixing long-standing issues with points where JFW fumbles.
That being said, there is such a wide variety of ways pc configurations may differ, there is probably not just one fix to be made. Maybe it’s as bad analogy, but it’s a bit like in dividualized medicine.
 
Plus, I understand that Microsoft began in Windows 10 to use a different method for writing information to the screen. I don’t know how tight the communication is between MS & FS, but I’d would think FS would have made the needed updates already!
Which is all academic if you’re dealing with a pc that isn’t performing as well as it did in the past, despite paying for new HW and/or SW.
 
Just my 2 cents.

Dale E. Heltzer
deheltzer@...True this too. As for the new hard ware thing interesting you meantion this because I'd thought that this would practically would make the PC new again. Maybe not then I guess. I also wander how the talks between FS and Google are cause of the talkyness of JAWS and lack of saying important things. Interesting if you do use IE on youtube all is pretty much business as usual. Which makes me ask is there perhaps code in JAWS that is still 90s code than? Could it perhaps be time for a total make over for JAWS? Maybe this is for a new thread but JAWS does seem to still for my youtube experience at least does seem to favor IE. So maybe theere is still favoritism for older versions of Windows. I don't know. I never thought to ask Eric. This year on top of my not thinking of these things this way I couldn't make it to NFB convention.

Youtube has been a subsidiary company of Google for over a decade. IE will still work, but why not seek to minimize irritants? Try Chrome. Just a thought, and only a thought.

Open the Speaker folder in the system tray and then open the Volume mixer.  Tab through to find the soundcard and there should be a volume control for this particular soundcard there.  You could also open Playback devices and change the volume for the soundcard in question there as well.  If you don't have the Speaker icon in the system tray go to the Control Panel / Sounds link to find the, Playback tab to choose your soundcard there.

Any time we don't know how to do something in windows, we should try typing it in the search window.
So tap the windows key and type in speaker, and then down arrow to speaker controls.
HTH.
GlennThanks, I already located it . It was set up at 100% I changed it to 7%.The command line argument for bringing up the volume control is:
 
sndvolit Said it is not recognized.
I did start run,   cmd enter.
then typed in the argument.
Justinthanks that makes it easyI don't know why it doesn't work with you but
You can type it directly in the run edit box and hit enter.
note: the command
sndvol
is one word no spaces.Hi Justin,
You don't need to drop to the CLI with cmd.
In the field where you typed CMD, type sndvol instead
HTH.
GlennNot from the command prompt, in the run dialog. For example:
 
windows key + R
 
then type
 
sndvol
one thing i did is use the command mentioned here and created a desktop batch file. then i don't have to type anything in the run box.
why not define the jaws volume         control in the jaws default keyboard manager?
in my case these key commands were un defined.
search  for increase and decrease to find these commands.
i am useing shift control and page up and down as my jaws volume controls.And you can set a hotkey for it if you press alt + enter on the icon and tab to shortcut.
Glenn
For me, the run box would be more convenient, as I hardly use the desktop for anything anymore.
But I do find that I have to adjust JAWS volume this way fairly often. Especially when playing streams from the web, whose volumes are often wildly inconsistent. Note to makers of podcasts with multiple participants: please normalise your volumes. Argh.
how could the run box be more convenient? haveing to type the program in every few minutes. like when trying to use youtube?
desktop shortcut and a hot key to run it you wouldn't have to be on the desktop to load it.
***
and for me it is much easier to run my programs from the desktop then haveing to go to the app list in the start menu for every program.
Hi.
Sure, hotkey is an option, and one I don't really invoke as often as would possibly be useful. I meant the desktop itself, though, is something that I hardly have used since the old days of Windows. The run box is very convenient for me but I am a fast typist and it only takes a second. Not sure why you brought up youtube, here, but certain programmes, like browsers, tend to remain open for long periods of time, even if they're not in use, so unless the browser crashes, I will open once from the run box and keep the programming running til I shut down the PC.
Oh, there it is.

it's a slightly more sophisticated interface.Same here.I am finding, though, that as a group moderator, there are links that won't
activate for me, so, as much as I like it, for now, am going back to IE with
Facebook.

 Regarding the free Mail app which is part of Windows 10 I'm wondering if it's just me or if the app's behavior when navigating messages is somewhat inconsistent. It's very difficult for me to articulate what I'm seeing and I suppose that I should write down some notes on its behavior but I'm finding that, overall, navigating messages doesn't reliably move to the message that you might be expecting, particularly when pressing the Home or End keys to move to the top and bottom of the list.

David Goldfield, Assistive Technology Specialist WWW.David-Goldfield.ComHi!
Here is a tutorial that I did on using the Mail app in Windows 10.
This will clear up a lot of questions.
Narrator and NVDA are by far best for using the Mail app.
When I use JAWS, it either closes the Mail app, or it does read the wrong message as you arrow through your list of messages.
Here is a drop box link for the tutorial.
It is a text tutorial where I take you through the Mail app with JAWS.
JAWS worked pretty good when I did this tutorial, but now, Narrator and NVDA work much better!
Here is the link to the tutorial:

This is of course tantalizing. Which other languages are included in the latest Vocalizer? Are there New voices in any of the current languages?

Email: ofiol@...yes, there a number of new voices, such as the Evan voice for US English, and more. In all there are around 145 voices with several new languages. Why not go to www.atguys.com  go to the screen reader voices link, then sapi5 vocalizer link, then get a 7 day trial. The sapi5 codeFactory vocalizer will work fine with jaws and then you can try the new voices, such as Evan for U.S. English. And the codeFactory vocalizer packages let you choose the voice quality, as in, do you want a great-sounding voice that is nearly 300mb? or do you want a much smaller compact voice which may only be 50mb but the quality is not as good. the voice manager codeFactory provides lets you manage which voices are installed and which ones are not with easy install/uninstall buttons, like how jaws lets you easily choose which vocalizer voices you want. I cannot wait until next Friday because I am spending the $115 on sapi5 vocalizer and another $69 on the eloquence/vocalizer combo-pack for NVDA. I run Jaws and NVDA on a cheap $110 United States dollars RCA cambio tablet with 2gigs ram, intel atom z8350 processor and windows 10 home 32bit and it has a physical keyboard dock and the tablet has a touch screen. It works great with Jaws, though sometimes a bit slow here and there. But at the time I did not have much money and needed a computer so figured I would try the RCA cambio with jaws just to see how it goes and it works quite well.

And due to the cheapness of the keyboard some key combinations with jaws do not work out of the box so you have to go into keyboard manager and change a few key combinations for laptop mode. I changed the jaws window key to capslock alt j, and made some other changes. Once I have the money saved up though I'll be getting an asus tough gaming laptop with AMD ryzen r5, 8gigs ram and at least 256gb solid state drive. I bet that'll run Jaws really really fast! also the vocalizer voices, even the highest quality ones work fine on the RCA Cambio tablet/hybrid laptop that I got. 

JoshHope someone who participates in the discussion call about jaws question ask about this. It will be nice to have more voices. Most of us can not affordthem and if jaws get them will be nice.Hi i just went to the web site you sent.

And looked threw the vocalizor voices and don't see aven in the list of US english voices.

So what did I miss if anything.

yes, there a number of new voices, such as the Evan voice for US English, and more. In all there are around 145 voices with several new languages. Why not go to www.atguys.com  go to the screen reader voices link, then sapi5 vocalizer link, then get a 7 day trial. The sapi5 codeFactory vocalizer will work fine with jaws and then you can try the new voices, such as Evan for U.S. English. And the codeFactory vocalizer packages let you choose the voice quality, as in, do you want a great-sounding voice that is nearly 300mb? or do you want a much smaller compact voice which may only be 50mb but the quality is not as good. the voice manager codeFactory provides lets you manage which voices are installed and which ones are not with easy install/uninstall buttons, like how jaws lets you easily choose which vocalizer voices you want. I cannot wait until next Friday because I am spending the $115 on sapi5 vocalizer and another $69 on the eloquence/vocalizer combo-pack for NVDA. I run Jaws and NVDA on a cheap $110 United States dollars RCA cambio tablet with 2gigs ram, intel atom z8350 processor and windows 10 home 32bit and it has a physical keyboard dock and the tablet has a touch screen. It works great with Jaws, though sometimes a bit slow here and there. But at the time I did not have much money and needed a computer so figured I would try the RCA cambio with jaws just to see how it goes and it works quite well.

Caseygo to www.atguys.com and under the screen reader voices section download a 7 day trial of vocalizer sapi5 voices, install and run the 7 day trial. reload jaws. then choose sapi5 and the vocalizer voices you installed will appear there. they also work with narrator on windows10. When you pay the $115 for your license, you get full access to all voices and all languages, install and uninstall as many or as few voices as you wish at any time using the vocalizer voice manager that gets installed when you install the 7 day trial. Hi can you send a sample of the new Evan voice to the list so we can hear what it sounds like.

When i looked at the voices I didn't see A Evan voice in the US English voices.

JustinBy accessible, do you mean just reading, or filling out a form?
For reading, you can open it in Open Book, or another OCR program, or you can open most with Acrobat DC, or Chrome and I think FireFox can read them.
You can use Jaws convenient OCR on it.
You can do that with the applications key.
Or you can use insert + space bar, and I think S is the key and P I think for page.
GlennUsing the find feature, and getting to where you want to in the document.
 
Being able to find chapters.
 
 
Thanks,
 
JustinHi Justin,
It will depend on which program you read them in.
I typically convert my PDF files and read them in Notepad or Word.
Then you just search normally.
Perhaps what you are wondering is how to open a PDF in something like Adobe DC and navigate through the document.
I recall a day when PDF files were difficult in Adobe, but seems to me that now there are keyboard commands for things like find and general navigation, and hopefully someone here knows some keystrokes.
Have you tried insert + H in the program to get some keyboard commands?
HTH.

I tried to get my current Skype phone number to work on the Skype website.

I had some of the same thoughts when I purchased 365. They say it is best to uninstall your previous version of office, so I called Microsoft accessibility, let them tandem in and do the the whole process. I have had no problems.

 Did they uninstall your old version of Office before they installed the new version?
Mr. EdWhen I install office 365, office 2013 was uninstall. I downloaded it and was install.Yes, And they told my sighted sister to do that when she switched also.
MHi Robin,
One of the key points is that the Office 365 that you install on your computer receives updates monthly.
It is also more accessible than the one in the cloud.

http://www.FreedomScientific.com/CertificationHi, Robin.

As John has correctly indicated there are some definite advantages to moving to Office 365. First, I can assure you with 100% certainty that you may download local copies of apps such as Word, Excel, Outlook, etc. If you decide to go with Office 365, you will be provided with a download link to a setup file. Once you run and install the setup file it will immediately download and install all of the Office apps. During this process almost no intervention from you is even required. Just run the setup file and the process of installing your Office programs begins immediately. If your UAC or user account settings are set to ask you to verify that you want to install Office just say Yes and then the process will begin. After the installation has completed the various Office apps will be available in your start menu.

As John has said Office 365 is updated monthly. These updates may contain new features that you will not receive if you have a perpetual license of Office, such as the license that you currently have with Office 2010. As an example, if you purchase Office 2019 you will certainly receive security updates but you won't receive any additional features. With Office 365, you not only receive security updates but you will receive additional features, as well, including some which may have a positive impact on accessibility.

Windows 7 and 10 home 64 bitYou could do this with the SharpKeys application from
https://www.randyrants.com/category/sharpkeys/

This is a standard Windows application so JAWS works quite nicely with
it.

Following description from that website:

SharpKeys is a Registry hack that is used to make certain keys on a
keyboard act like other keys. For example, if you accidentally hit Caps
Lock often, you could use this utility to map Caps Lock to a Shift key or even turn
it off completely. This official release includes support for up to 104
mappings, an extensive list of available keys, and a �Type Key� option to help
when managing mappings. As it relies on internal support within Windows
NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows
8, or Windows 10 you must be running one of these OS's for this
Registry hack to work.

reading unlabeled graphics 4 messages,"Vicki,
 
Almost by definition, JAWS can’t read graphics that aren’t labeled. What JAWS can do is enable you to assign labels when you figure out what a graphic represents. This works with browsers, and it probably also works with email.
 
If you’re getting email from the same source with unlabeled graphics, you might try to figure out what they each stand for and assign your own label. Sometimes you can figure it out by clicking on a link and finding where it takes you. Sometimes context gives it away. Otherwise, you may need someone with vision to interpret for you, and then you can assign a label for when the graphic appears the next time.

https://www.gofundme.com/sugars-transplant-journeyI suppose you could use it in tablet mode or auto hide the taskbar found under settings > personalization > taskbarI’m not sure you want to remove the taskbar, but you’d definitely want to stop it getting in the way when you switch screens. What keystroke do you use to switch?Yes that is what I mean, sorry
I use the tab and alt key to switch from screen to screen

-SugarIsn't that what
""auto-hide the taskbar""
is in the task bar properties?
I always have this checked, I thought it was checked by default.
I don't know if that will fix this or not though.
On the task bar, you can press alt + enter to get the properties.
 
GlennIf you’re alt-tabbing, I would assume you’re using the alt-tab to switch from one program to another—a Word doc to an email message--or between two documents or messages within the same program (if you have your task bar set up that way).  The only time I can see a running program getting in the way would be if you had JAWS running on the task bar instead of in the system tray.  If you remove JAWS, then there won’t be that extra program to alt-tab through.
If you happen to have more than two programs running that you do want open, windows key-tab is a more efficient way to switch.
Press windows key-tab then left or right arrow quickly to the one you want and press enter.  Or if you know the order of the programs on the task bar, press windows key and the number of the program you want.Thanks for that tip

-SugarHi Chris,
I know most people cannot see this but what ever font color you have chosen does not show up on the screen. Jaws read it fine but there is no fonts showing on the last few emails you have sent to the group. You might want to have a sighted person look on your screen and see if they can read your text. Just thought I would let you know.
Mr. EdIf you hide the Taskbar in, Settings / Personalization / Taskbar, you
won't be able to access icons in the system tray.  For example; with the Taskbar hidden and you click on the Speaker icon in the system tray you won't see any speaker settings options, but a context menu opens instead that has nothing to do with speaker settings.
Take care.  Mike.  Sent from my iBarstool.  Go dodgers!

reposting question reading unlabeled graphics 10 messages,"I posted this question awhile ago and didn't receive an answer so I thought I'd try again.
Is there a way to read unlabeled graphics in an e-mail with JAWS 2019? Seems like there was.
 
Thanks.
 
VickiHi, Vicki.

Try this. Press insert-V go enter the JAWS Options dialog.

2. Begin typing in the word ""graphic"" without the quotes. Typing graph should suffice.

3. Press down arrow. Look for the ""graphics"" option. Pressing the space key should toggle between all, none and labeled.

Does that help?

David Goldfield, Assistive Technology Specialist WWW.David-Goldfield.ComNo, that didn't work. Still just says the word link and the word graphic.
 
VickiVicki,
 
If I understand your query correctly, you want JAWS to read unlabeled graphics in email. Almost by definition, JAWS can’t read graphics that aren’t labeled.
 
What JAWS can do is enable you to assign labels when you figure out what a graphic represents. This works with browsers, and it probably also works with email. If you’re getting email from the same source with unlabeled graphics, you might try to figure out what they each stand for and assign your own label. Sometimes you can figure it out by clicking on a link and finding where it takes you. Sometimes context gives it away. Otherwise, you may need someone with vision to interpret for you, and then you can assign a label for when the graphic appears the next time.I’m resubmitting this post because it didn’t appear when I first sent it.I’m resubmitting this post because it didn’t appear when I first sent it.Hi Adrian,

select language hotkey in laptop layout,"Hi all. Thankss to all thee recent discussions about JAWS keyboard layouts, I decided that since my laptop has only a right windows key, I could benefit from having capslock as a modifier key. Except that I now have a perplexing problem. The ""select language"" script has no assigned key, so I assigned it to control+modifier+L. That combination works on my desktop but not on my laptop. But every other  hotkey using the modifier works for me using either capslock or insert. When I first tried that key combination, JAWS gave me new conflict errors. I also tried deleting and reassigning the keystroke. There is therefore no good reason why this keystroke doesn't bring up the language list as it should. In fact, it doesn't even work using insert rather than capslock.. Any ideas?

skype update alert,"Hi all.

Just a quick heads up:

You'll all probably get a notification to update your version of skype to 8.49.0.49, and, of course, skype will automatically restart itself.

When I took the update, I couldn't make or receive calls.

A complete system restart solved the problem.

Just stay sharp.

split view,"Hi guys In the wake of recent discussions, I thought some might be interested in this article sent to another list. Skype Desktop App Receives Back Split View As you may already know, Microsoft is about to retire the classic Skype app in November 2018. One of its most popular features, Split View, is finally coming to the latest Skype Desktop.
Skype Desktop joins the Store app, which has received the same feature in October 2018. The new Skype Desktop app has a very streamlined user interface. It follows the modern trend of flat minimalist design with glyph icons and no borders anywhere. This design is being used in all other Microsoft products. It is an Electron-based application. Split View is a special mode of the app that allows having each conversation in a separate window, rather than showing them all in a single window merged with the contact panel. The Split View feature is available in Skype Desktop starting with Insider Preview version 8.51.76.74.  As of this writing, this feature is exclusively available to the Skype App Preview program users. To try the feature, you need to click on the menu button with three dots (""..."") and then select ""Enable Split View mode"" from the menu. After that, the main window will display your contacts only. Double-click on any contact to open a new conversation in a new window. To restore the default appearance, use the Open recent chats button available in the top left corner of any chat window. Also, the Split View feature can be disabled in the main menu (""...""). This new mode should be welcomed by users of the classic Skype app. Microsoft is actively working to move users from Skype 7 to the modern Skype 8.",,,,,1,291,95.26,23.66,53.17,63.53,16.17,22.34,81.79,57.39,45.36,5.84,1.72,0.34,0,1.03,0,0.34,4.12,17.87,9.97,3.44,14.43,6.87,3.09,2.75,0.34,12.03,8.93,3.09,2.75,1.37,0.69,0.69,12.03,1.03,11,1.03,1.37,1.37,1.72,0,5.15,0,2.75,2.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.5,3.44,0,0.69,0,0,2.41,1.72,0,0,0,0.34,3.09,0,0,3.09,5.5,0,1.72,3.44,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,2.41,11,0.34,0.69,7.22,3.09,0,0,5.5,1.37,4.47,1.72,0,0,0,0,0,17.18,9.28,3.78,0,0,0,4.12
strange happening on skype,"Hi list ken here.  For the third time in a row after signing into our radio station skype in rapid fire succession there has been a whole big bunch of missed called from the same number.  Last Wednesday there were 13 of them all at once, then Sunday there were I think 9 and today five all rapid fire.  We have a landline number that works with skype it’s as if an autodialer is trying trying and trying to call us and each time it hits a nonworking number it tries again. And when I or someone else logs in bang whole big block of missed calls.  It’s obviously telemarketers.  Blocking does no good because likely the number being used is a spoof of a nonworking number.

The reason I ask is that when people set up their eMail account, there is a reply address in the account settings and often people leave this blank, but if they accidentally have a typo in that field, people won't be able to reply, and possibly the wrong address could be added to the other party's contacts.
