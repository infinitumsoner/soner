"(Real Footage) Two Frenchmen in 1973 find an uncontacted tribe who have never seen white skin or modern technology before, and think they’re ghosts.","Hoax https://asopa.typepad.com/asopa_people/2011/07/toulambi-1976-contact-fact-or-fable.htmlbeen reposted a lot over the years, rumored to be staged. im just the messenger, i have no horse in the raceReally odd an uncontacted culture would also assume ghosts are white.Makes a nice change for this subThere’s an ~40 minute documentary on this event in youtube, the guy learns their language while staying there, got sucked into it.I'd be damned, this actually is interestinggod i can’t imagine how terrifying that would beIt's called a cargo cult.I remember reading somewhere that one tribe thought there were invisible bridges that the planes drove on in the sky.I have spent unusual amounts of time in remote places, like eight-week stints alone in the Arctic. Yes, planes turn into this other world kind of thing and (totally out of contact with civilization) you dream up all these scenarios like they are planes full of soldiers flying around the world and that a nuclear war has started. It’s weird as hell, especially in this age, coming out of the wilderness after a long stretch. Your brain is in such a different place out there it’s really hard to describe to regular people. You spend your life worrying about hypothermia, polar bears, and rockfall. Everything after that is a hard-earned luxury.I'm pretty sure they at least don't care about chemtrails.: Civilized people when a UFO appears above them…https://guardian.ng/life/culture-lifestyle/the-remote-south-pacific-island-where-they-worship-planes/They think not this asshole again.The first times would have been terrifying.  But nowadays they probably just see it as part of nature, like lightning.  Maybe some of them tell stories about the old days when there were no loud-birds.During WW2 a war plane dropped supplies off to an uncontacted tribe and they made a statue of plane thinking of it as a god https://www.indy100.com/amp/remote-religion-planes-sky-7382991-2656352493Probably a big bird but either way in their mind no good can come from a big flying objects making lots of noise over themMy fave anthro prof joined the abelam tribe. They valued bird imagery highly, so when they heard he arrived on one, they named him “bird-like”. He asked if they wanted to learn more about technology they said “nah, it’s obvious, they slide on wires”.A tribe in the Amazon believed that they were souls of the dead ascending.My brother recently visited a village that had very little contact with outsiders (as in outside of their country). They were aware that what they saw flying over were planes, and presumably that they transported people, but one of the first things they asked was how he fit in one. I guess it's difficult to get an idea of the size at that distance.The Gods Must be CrazyI always wonder about uncontacted tribes in the sense that, what did they think it was when a plane flew over them?Apparently from 1993, potentially a hoax.

3d Printing IOS Software,"I doubt many people printing are using apple products lol, the freedom and DIY/think for yourself nature of printing is at complete odds with apple. I agree that recent phones/tablets are more than powerful enough to handling slicing, and the other commenter talking about large files sizes is clearly in a very small minority as any competent designer would never allow their stl file size to be that large, even a 4 million polygon high detail statue is roughly equal to 200mb only. There's also the fact that more and more people rely on their phones now for almost everything and may not even have a proper computer. I personally wouldn't be in the target market for something like this but I can see that there is a potential market.Here is the bigger question, how many people who said yes would actually follow though?  I very much doubt you will ever be able to charge for 3d printing software considering all the free options.my thought process is that my Ipad can handle 4k video editing and photo editing, that I use daily, why couldn't it handle processing for splicing.

Almost done my player piano. Few more software bugs to work out.,"Thanks! :)So freaking cool! Awesome job!I currently don't but that is a good question. It is currently controlled via midi (either via RTPMidi or simple UDP messages) and there are some cases where the midi notes are too close together (ie. the time between a note turning off and then being played again. You can see an example of more of this in this video). That is something i've tried to and been somewhat successful in dealing with on the midi side (ie. parsing the midi files and modifying them to have gaps etc) but I would rather have this dealt with on the arduino/firmware/server side so I don't have to use specific parsed midi files sometimes.really cool, curious if you compensate for the deadtime of the solenoids?make it play Circus Galop!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DekTSh1QmvYWow, high five GG, that is awesome!  Thanks for zooming in near the end to see the hardware at work, very cool!!Thanks! :)Nice ! Solenoids sound like someone tap dancing.  So you estimate each solinoid cost $1000/56 or $18 each ? Seems like a lotIt does not. That would be great though :) I didn't build that into my plan and I think I would need to tweak the electronics a bit to pull it off.Can you effectively PWM a solenoid?  Never thought about that.  I think of them as just 2-state mechanical devices, not having states in-between.Does it have any expression control? Perhaps by varying solenoid current?Possibly. I never actually checked. The reason I wanted them to be able to ""play"" the keys like a normal person would is so that I could use it on ""any"" piano. Now obviously there are issues with the length and what not but that is more of a ""cross that bridge when we get to it"" type of problem.Are your piano's keys' internally long enough you could mount the solenoids on the other side of the lever?Sounds like there's a skeleton dancing along, just out of frame:) :) :)That's insane, in a good way.But the clicking gives it a wonderfully unique sound.

I'm fairly certain the likelihood of me messing up in some way (with a pump or MD)l is orders of magnitude higher than the pump messing up.This does make me feel better.

"An MIT Professor says the Carbon Capture provisions in recent US Climate Change legislation (IRA Bill), are a complete waste of money and merely a disguised taxpayer subsidy for the fossil fuel industry, and that Carbon Capture is a dead-end technology that should be abandoned.","Ok, so not a complete waste of money then? We're not about to stop using plastic and cement a a myriad other things that produce CO2.Thank you for this added infoOP is a carbon capture expert, and founder of the first US carbon capture firm (15 years ago, when he thought the technology might work). The crux of his argument is that every dollar invested in renewables is far more effective in reducing carbon dioxide than carbon capture technology. Furthermore, this gap is widening. Renewable+Storage gets cheaper every year, but carbon capture does not. Submission Statement PAYWALLED TEXTIs it possible for us to engineer a catalyst molecule which absorbs energy from the sun, and binds to CO2, precipitating it out of the air? Seems like it should be possible, since photosynthesis happens in nature already. So many people talk about how it's impossible to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a large enough scale to make a difference. Getting huge algae farms in the ocean to pump out these molecules seems like it would scale large enough to counteract human sources of CO2 production.Sounds really interesting! Might I ask: which company do you work for? Or is there an association for CCS companies? I work for a climate education and careers company and I’m always interested in learning about more companies doing climate work.There’s push and pull but the general takeaway is that everyone was able to make progress even a coal guy like Manchin toward green energy. Indeed, there were compromises made but a lot of progress and even as some have said drilling MORE was provided for in the bill, part of it is to reduce inflation, lower some prices with more supply on the way to more green energy. …And Sinema got hedge fundies and tax loopholes into place and as a former member of the Green Party coulda been the one standing next to Biden but nope.I was about to ask; Even if we managed to make 100% of our electricity through renewable/green energy with zero carbon emissions, we still use coke, petroleum, crude, etc for the refining and production industries. Ideally we decrease the carbon as much as we can, but considering hydrocarbon refining literally depends on crude oil and natural gas, we can't replace them in this instance. That being said, why is the exhaust from cement manufacturing and iron smelting worthwhile to carbon capture and store, in contrast to power plant flue? Does CCS work better or worse with regards to the completeness of the burning (sooty smoke vs pure carbon dioxide and water)? Are there studies looking into capturing the carbon dioxide from environmental air (not exhaust from industry)? I know we don't have any technology that can do so efficiently now, but I was curious if you believe it could be a possible tech within our toolbox to decrease our carbon footprint. Undoubtedly, the most effective way by far to decrease atmospheric carbon is by decreasing emissions, not trying to suck it out of the air. The whole adage about the best medicine being prevention and all that. Are there any other sources of carbon emissions you can think of that inherently cannot be solved with a perfect CCS system? Something like slash and burn agriculture, transport emissions (except maybe for ships), permafrost melting, and the like? Given a hypothetical scenario where policy change is impossible regarding these sources, what path do you think carbon capture could take to assuage these sources? What does the near future research path look like for making CCS technology cheaper, more efficient, scalable, etc? I'm aware these are quite a few questions but I think it's super exciting for me to speak to someone in this research field and industry! I'm definitely looking into studying more of this stuff in the near future but it's always great to be able to direct some of my curiosity over to someone already in the know. Many thanks for your time by the way.Don't we need CCS to have any chance of correcting climate change?No dataNo dataYeah, to say CCS is a dead end is a vast oversimplification. Yes, it might not work in some applications. Yes, it might be expensive, but the only way to get that expense down is to invest in it and try new things. For example, basalt scattering is one of the more interesting ideas I've seen regarding CCS. For example, basalt scattering is one of the more interesting ideas I've seen regarding CCS. https://physicsworld.com/a/sprinkling-basalt-over-soil-could-remove-huge-amounts-of-carbon-dioxide-from-the-atmosphere/ I've been considering basalting my own yard to see. I thought electrification is way better for steel than CCS? All the retrofitting needed kills the economicsWhy would flue gas from electrical generation be any different from anything else that burns natural gas?.. I'm just glad that someone who seems to know what they are talking about has something positive to say.Edit: My background is in atmospheric chemistry so if folks also have questions about industrial emissions or climate change, please feel free to ask. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have about carbon capture or industrial decarbonization as a whole.That being said, CCS for industry is an excellent and one of the best ways to decarbonize many of the materials we need for everyday life. CCS is one of the only ways to decarbonize steel and cement production. No amount of renewable capacity will reduce the carbon intensity of those products. Renewables+storage combined with CCS is an efficient and cost effective way to decarbonize very quickly. I work in carbon capture and everyone agrees that carbon capture and storage (CCS) for electrical generating plants is pointless. The flue gases are too diffuse, the parasitic load is rather high, and it’s one of the most expensive sectors to install CCS. Edit2: I should add that direct air capture (DAC) will likely be one of the most important ways we start to get CO2 levels back to pre-industrial amounts in the next few centuries.The following submission statement was provided by /u/lughnasadh: Submission Statement OP is a carbon capture expert, and founder of the first US carbon capture firm (15 years ago, when he thought the technology might work).

Are Software/Computer Engineers Really Engineers?,"Wait till you find out that your average cs employee doesn't make what reddit makes it seem like they do.Chose your pick! b) Would you rather earn $200K+ with WFH job working 4 hours maximum everyday? OR a) Would you rather be called an Engineer? You are right. BUT:Software engineers are engineers just like any other field. They design, architect and build systems and softwares just like a civil engineer that build a real life building or a mechanical engineer that builds a car. Instead, they build software. These softwares are designed, built and scaled by software engineers. They r not just programmers that write code as you may think. Think of the software that are used by airplanes for example, one bug or error in the design could eventually kill hunders of people on the plane. Its a serious field of study. Software engineers dont just sit at a desk and write code all day lolWell, engineering means making something useful from theoretic principles so I don't see why not?Yes and they'll make 2x as much as you.Anyone who thinks chemical engineers are chemists has no clue what we do. There could maybe be valid arguments that we aren’t the purest of pure engineers because we rarely design physical things but other than that idk.Srsly dudenah chemical engineers and chemists two completely different thingsI 100% do not consider myself to be a chemist lolWell some people don’t consider chemical engineers to be real engineers like mechanical or electrical. They consider us chemists. But the point is no one cares what you consider is a real engineer or not. “Engineer” isn’t a protected title so technically anyone can be an engineer. A great machinist I knew had a title of engineer at a company I used to work for.They understand and use theoretical concepts to create practical and concrete applications, which is what I consider an engineer to be at the most base level.  That's enough overlap that I think it's fair to say they are.  Although I do think all of the tech professions (computer scientist, IT, programmer, web developer, etc) will become so different from traditional engineering in the future that they will separate themselves anyway.If there isn’t a B.Eng in it, it ain’t engineering.The engineering portion comes from making code, circuitry or molecules into reliable goods and services for the masses and scaling up the delivery and maintenance of those services. The engineering is the QC, QA, standard settings, cost optimization, supply chain management and making the business case of these services.💯 we are not , we are dumb as shitIt doesn't matter, it's just a title. Some would say engineering students aren't real engineers either....There isn’t any good reason to gatekeep the title.Do you design, monitor, and/or maintain relatively complicated systems such as a factory or sewage system?  I think a computer network or software program of similar complexity counts.I guess I feel like engineers deal more with the physical world and highly physical/scientific problems whereas obviously computer engineers deal with the cyber world. That’s what make it hard for me to relate to computer engineers. Chemical engineers ask molecules to please do <XXX>.  Mechanical engineers force matter to do <YYY>.  Electrical engineers trick electrons into doing <ZZZ>. Materials engineers browbeat matter into acting like <QQQ>.  Civil engineers ensure that items can handle <PPP> conditions. Programmers tell computers what to do... its like dealing with a tween that will engage any/every loophole to coopt the spirit of whatever instructions they are given. mmm, there's enough overlap IMO.

Are There NESDR Linux Software Alternatives to Mathworks Comm Tookit?,"Good. And thanks. In fact, after I posted this I found a note that I had forgotten, the NESDR Smart is the same hardware as the RTL-SDR so anything there applies (within reason). I bought the Nooelec kit because it was recommended as a very good value with the Ham It Up upconverter, antenna kit. SDR dongle and miscellaneous connectors & cables at about $115.00. just for dipping toes in the water, the first real expenditure will be antenna related - and test equipment. CubicSDR and SDR++ are likely my first tries.It depends on what you're looking to do, but SDR++, gqrx, CubicSDR, rtl_fm, rtlsdr-airband, trunk-recorder, gnuradio, etc... really any of the Linux options on this list are available to you.",2,122,0.016393443,0.016393443,1,121,64.75,22.69,23.01,82.62,15.13,20.66,72.73,64.46,52.07,12.4,5.79,4.13,0,1.65,0,0,6.61,14.05,8.26,2.48,13.22,7.44,4.96,8.26,0,14.05,6.61,2.48,0.83,0,0.83,0,11.57,0,11.57,2.48,2.48,0,4.13,1.65,2.48,0.83,4.13,4.13,0,1.65,1.65,0,0,0,0,0,4.13,2.48,0.83,0.83,0,0,0.83,1.65,0,0,0,0,0.83,0,0,0.83,2.48,0,0,0.83,1.65,0,0.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.48,4.96,0,0,4.13,0.83,0,0,0.83,4.96,4.96,0.83,0,0,0,0,0,31.4,9.92,9.92,0,0,0.83,10.74,

Best way to find the name of linux software you see?,"you can make almost any terminal emulator look like that. fwiw: most people just go with whatever emulator is provided by their desktop environment or the distro and the emulators that aren't provided like that are usually the most fully featured but also generally provide a weaker desktop experience since they may not integrate as well with the desktop environment you're using.ah ok, whenever I google something about linux questions it always takes me here instead since I guess this gets search priority so I didn't even know that sub existed.Just ask. Either here or in r/linuxquestions or go on one of the countless linux discord servers. and the terminal he is using looks like zsh + https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh + some theme. e.g. this looks similar: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49100982/108254745-777cb400-716c-11eb-800a-a8cfa612253f.jpg from https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/ThemesWith most linux terminals, you'll most likely be able to do anything you want visually, it just takes a bit of time. When it comes to looks itll be modifying your terminal emulators settings/config. As for finding software, most people (not all) on youtube like this will have a github page with their config files, so you can look at those and find what softwares they are using (even copy their config if you really like what you see).
Havent checked the video you linked cause im on mobile, but here are Chris' dotfiles on his github: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/dotfilesJust looks like a powerline prompt. r/unixporn is probably worth a look. For easy on the eyes I just use solarized dark scheme or similar with a monospaced font. I've never used it but I think oh-my-zsh is quite popular if you can't be arsed reading docs, setting things up and want it to look good and do fancy things. Terminal emulators are not everything, the interactive shell you are using inside the terminal emulator is important. Bash is most common, ZSH has more shiny things, Fish feels cool & easy but has some weird behaviour I can't be bothered to figure out.This is kind of a weird question. If you want to make your terminal look better or try different terminals you can just google for options. The video just looks like he's using zsh and oh my zsh or something that handles glyphs well. If you want good fonts you can try ones from nerdfonts. I would really start by just learning how to change the terminal manually if you want to have an intuitive understanding of it. Once you get a configuration you like I would recommend keeping it on git incase you need to redo it all later. Also keep in mind you might spend a lot of time inside other applications that have their own appearance.You can replicate that look in the video you linked (which is basically a green colorscheme, that to be honest doesn't look very good at all, and a custom $PS1) on most terminal emulators. If you aren't using any of the advanced features most terminal emulators will feel pretty much the same.I, did copy with a timestamp? you can see it in the URL ""?t=206"" is a timestamp for 206 seconds in.you may want to show the screen shot, or other images of what you are looking for. Not everyong is going to spend time watching a youtube video. or at least copy the url of the video with a timestamp for a specific segment/image. I skimmed the video, and did not see anything that outstanding about the terminal he was using. Green text on a black background, a rather standard color scheme.  Many terminal emulators have that color scheme  in their defaults. You might want to start actually just using things, and see what you actually like.  People in the support subs often worry way too much about things that in the long run, dont matter.",17,639,0.026604069,0.026604069,1,663,38.2,40.06,18.95,35.16,23.68,18.25,82.81,69.98,55.2,14.48,8.14,2.11,0,4.37,0.6,1.06,6.33,14.03,6.33,1.06,11.31,9.05,6.79,5.73,2.11,18.4,6.03,4.07,1.06,0,0.75,0.3,19.46,0.75,18.7,2.26,2.71,3.02,6.18,1.21,6.03,0,3.62,2.26,1.21,1.21,0.45,0.75,0.15,0,0,0.15,9.05,2.87,0.15,0,0,0,0.45,6.03,0,0,0,0.6,1.36,0,0,1.36,1.06,0,0,0.6,0.45,0,0.6,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,0,0.15,1.06,0.6,0,0.15,0,0,0,0.6,8.3,9.05,1.81,0.6,3.32,4.68,0,0.45,2.56,1.36,6.94,1.51,1.36,0.9,0.15,0.3,0,17.19,6.18,2.71,0.3,0,1.66,6.33,

CS106 most compatible linux software?,"Tits! I've seen other posts saying this same thing. That's good to know, since I have no idea what this project is even talking about. Side note, I just started this course 30 minutes ago, so probably will have a better understanding once I do all the chapters.What did you skip? God, I hate this class. Did you install all that Recoll and Apache stuff? I have no clue what this project is even asking. Do you think you could just say screw Linux and just take screenshots of searching for files in windows and get away with it? All I learned in this course is, no wonder nobody uses Linux.Really that's good to know it'll be cool if I can get 100 on it like that, I made the mistake of not taking the final after the quizzes because I've been looking for a compatible version so I already forgot the course lolI just finished this class in SDC. Used Oracle’s virtual box. Also, don’t sweat making the assignment perfect. I skipped steps and was stressed as hell about it and they still gave me a 100 on it… seems like they just want you to do the assignment and they don’t even look at it.I probly just have trash hardware tbhJust commenting to follow this. I will be starting this course this week and would like to see what others say. It's the one course that I'm most nervous about.My friend!!!! I'll look into these solutions thanks :)!!!I assume you're referring to CS106 on SDC. If you're having trouble installing a Linux distribution directly on the drive that's off the shelf compatible with your hardware, you have many alternative options. Perhaps the easiest and least expensive would be to run the .iso you've downloaded on a virtual machine, such as with VirtualBox. Alternatively, you can ssh into a VPS that you get from Digital Ocean, Linode, Vultr, or an even cheaper one found on lowendbox.com.

California regulators aim to revoke Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state over the company's marketing of its 'Full Self-Driving' technology,"Please teach me about this almost free Bolt lease.I'm interested in the almost free bolt informationMy wife wanted a Tesla, we got a crazy good deal on a Bolt EUV lease (almost free).

After seeing Elon's rants, union busting, covid rants, and the fact that Tesla is STILL selling ""Self Driving""… She is over it, does not want one, thinking of keeping the EUV. Fuck Elon.It’s more like people giving him money for something that’s not yet available. They didn’t need to do thatUnfortunately, that is a very common practice in the software industry and I believe it’s a reason so many companies have changed to cloud/as a service subscriptions. That way, the customer never owns anything, and it’s always in “the next release.”This has been a constant with Musk.I agree. He’s actually been taking money for something that’s not available yet.Took the words outta my mouth!Fuck Elon MuskBecause you live in a bubbleIt was the same with Steve Jobs. Worse even.Tech releases has always been like thisPeople get excited about new stuff. Steve Jobs pulled a rectangle out of his pocket and the crowd went wildSearch Steve JobsWhy are people cheering Elon in this photo like it’s a rock concert is the real question. The cults of personalities these days seem out of control. Edit: To those saying Steve Jobs had the same thing, of course he did, and it’s just as bad.Years ago a Tesla sales rep interrupted a conversation I was having with a friend of mine to insist that Teslas were completely autonomous.  I had never had such a blatant and easily disproven lie shoved in my face by someone representing a company like that.Where is your facts for this statement???https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport“To ensure our statistics are conservative, we count any crash in which Autopilot was deactivated within 5 seconds before impact, and we count all crashes in which the incident alert indicated an airbag or other active restraint deployed. (Our crash statistics are not based on sample data sets or estimates.)”Tesla counts any accident that occurs within 5 seconds after disengagement of autopilot in their autopilot safety reports.The guy was in a relationship and had a child with one of his employees. Sure, she was at Neuralink and not Tesla or SpaceX, but that’s wildly inappropriate. Any other CEO would have gotten shit canned for that.If i was an insurance company I wouldn't insure any that came with the auto pilot feature if that's how they rollHave heard that claim before of Autopilot turning off, but have never seen a source (just Redditors claiming it happened). Happen to have a source?Improvident.  Fancy word.  Had to look it up.weird_nerds.jpgAny other car company would have long since removed a CEO who was so  prone to improvident and reckless behavior. Not that Teslas are any more or less dangerous than other vehicles on the road. But things like turning off Autopilot 1-second before impact so they could claim that accident involved vehicles were ""not under automated driving mode"" goes so far over the line of responsible and prudent regard for their customers and the general public that the company seriously needs to change it's ways.Nevermind marketing laws, how is it legal for Tesla or anyone else to use unwitting road users as crash test dummies?10 years is fast for false advertising. Took a LOT longer for cell carriers to need to put the asterisk on unlimited in all ads. This isn’t an improvement either. The specific terms became defined by a regulatory authority in the interim period allowing for a simple complaint instead of waiting for a settlement. As compared to cases like the Germany ones the US hasn’t even gotten started.A matter of enforcement. Take a look at tesla in China. Tesla behaves like a saint thereWhy did it take countries like 10 years to catch up with something that simply should've been against marketing laws.Wasn't there a case where the driver of an RV in “autopilot” mode went to the back of her car and crashed? This was back when “autopilot“ was nothing more than the car keeping a constant speed.Companies lie at-will.  They call it ""corporate free speech"".  It's like how every mobile company has an unlimited plan with limitations.  Oh it's unlimited but you restrict the speed?  That's not the definition of unlimited according to Webster.Ironically I just saw a Model Y minutes ago with a bumper sticker saying “I’m probably not driving.”But he is a Republican so any personal responsibility is not supposed to apply to him Republicans are supposed to be allowed to do whatever they want without consequencesBut I saved up all my pennies! I'm all ready to go buy my self-driving $39,900 Cybertruck that Daddy Elon promised me I could buy if I was a really good boy and bought crypto whenever he tweeted. /sSurprise, insinuate your cars are self driving to the general masses as a marketing tool even if the fine, or even giant glaring print says otherwise and you might just get into trouble.YSK the German court ruled yesterday that Tesla AP and FSD are not false advertising. They can't claim ""by the end of the year anymore"" though. Like I said, you misread the article. I tried to explain it to you and you refused to relent, then made snarky comments about those trying to correct you elsewhere in the thread in a big circlejerk. Your comment with misinformation was at the top and likely hundreds of thousands of people saw it. My comments with explanations and sources were downvoted hundreds of times. Th e standing of your article is still valid - if it's not good enough people can refund it. Nothing about false advertising.Like, come on man.Edit: Since more than one person asked, we were looking at Tesla’s website. You don’t have to take out commercials on tv, put billboards up, or take out ads in newspapers for something to be “advertising”. All marketing materials, including booklets you’d look at at a dealership are advertisements.

"Developing a software product, where to start......","Like this. Would be interested in reading more of your suggestions.One other key point before the one pager is getting customer feedback. Asking around if people experience the problem, you’re trying to solve and how they currently solve it.Start with the client.  What do they need?I would disagree, a software product is a startup it is a product that needs to be defined and the above items need to be done it actually needed and ensure the product stays inside the bounds. A lot of posts here are actually developers who have skipped the aforementioned steps and started creating/created a software product that isn’t needed in the market. And are then surprised when nobody signs up for them, or they create an MVP with features that aren’t actually needed.This looks like advice for founding a startup, not for developing a software product. As far as that goes, thinking things through is great advice, as I've had tons of people come up to me with very low-resolution ideas. A lot of those people want an actual developer to turn their pipe dream into a genius app that they can take credit for. Making a wish list, no matter how detailed, and paying someone else to develop it isn't developing a product, it's getting a product developed.Very good advice!Agreed.  You should sell the product before you build the product.  Only build it if people buy it.Agreed.Agreed, this should be covered in the ""One Pager"" where you are doing your thinking.

Did anyone have to choose between selling your solution to a problem as a software product or a hardware product? I feel like my idea could go either way.,"Maybe you could start with some customers' interviews and see what your potential clients would prefer?Two major factors come to mind:If it's something with a microprocessor, you can make it HW but with OTA  firmware updates. This way  you can iterate fast and add functionality later (plus, you can charge for updates and get a recurring revenue stream).We are doing both and neither is easy in anyway. The both have their rewards and headaches.Always go sw. Hw is tough to execute if you are new to it. Saas product can give hockey stick adoption.Apologize for the somewhat vague description of my idea. I don't care to talk in detail about it if it matters but didn't feel the actual idea was relevant to the question.Everyone says go software, and of course it's easier. Though I will note, if you manage to pull the hardware portion of it off, you'll have a significant moat for the exact reason everyone is saying do software: No one else wants to get into hardware. It's a pain in the ass.These guys talk about being a HW company and realizing that was a bad choice: https://vimeo.com/649655767/0f8c13b173this is exactly right: don't jump into hardware until you know that you can sell the thing.What he said.Lol I fucking hate manufacturing so I get it, trust me. Not a bad idea going software first and then trying to branch out into hardware if it shows promise. There's a nagging in the back of my mind though that keeps saying a software version wouldn't completely address the issue. It would be more of a bandaid.Glib answer: stay away from HW if you value your sanity. 9 Depends on the complexity of the device, but generally, SW is going to be easier. HW startups have a necessarily high burn rate, and increase the logistical complexity by orders of magnitude.

Reddit, you never fail to surprise me. So, there's a few people here who are talking about this like it's concrete, but to me it looks more like they're compacting clay. Are these rammed earth buildings? Do you happen to know where I could take a look at the patent for that ""print head?""Do you have an address for the second structure? We could look it up on google maps.He must be smiling, knowing you followed in his footsteps of  3d printingMy great grandfather is the inventor of this machine. The building in this video no longer stands, but a second structure, in which was built with the “print head” on a track instead of a rotating point, still stands today.Came here to say this.That's because this is designed to only print circles, vs concrete printers are made to make any designs, like 3D printers. It's like calling a plastic extrusion machine a 3D printer.Concrete was different consistency back then.Yeah, I was going to say, this reminds me of that old space pen urban legend, as an example of over engineering problems with simple solutions.There are already 3d printed concrete with smooth surfaces. See: r/3Dprinting/comments/p6565k/the_smoothest_3d_printed_concrete_ive_seen_so_far/ Others purposely leave it rounded.That's what trades can do. I love my machines, but skilled labor is underrated.This is giving me some ideas. What if we dyed concrete. Then we can “draw” whatever patterns we want with the dye, and along with these flat surfaces, can end up looking quite nice.They don’t 3D print like they used to...That is easily remedied on current concrete printers. You can simply add a slip forming box around the depositor to get a nice smooth shape. The reason they don't do it is because right now they still want you to know it was 3D printed. Sort of like how some cars would leave carbon fiber panels raw so people knew it was carbon fiber when it first became popular.The nicely formed layers are much nicer looking than current concrete printers.They probably reused one of those for this The real question is why this method didnt catch onLooks exactly like the machine used for creating curbs, wondering if this type of form which created cleaner lines and flatter surfaces is stronger(wind resistance)than the current ones.Yah I want a time machine to ask them what their slicer settings were...They used supportsClean bridging on that window frame",5,439,0.011389522,0.011389522,1,449,42.86,45.33,24.14,72.55,29.93,20.27,85.97,70.38,53.01,15.59,7.13,2.23,0.89,1.34,0.45,2,8.46,14.25,6.01,2.9,12.47,10.24,6.01,4.23,1.34,19.82,7.8,2.67,2.67,0.89,1.34,0.45,13.81,0.67,13.14,2.45,2.67,2.67,2,1.11,3.12,0.22,3.56,3.34,0,0.89,0.67,0,0,0,0,0,7.8,2.23,0.22,0.22,0,0,1.56,5.35,0.45,0,0,0.89,4.45,0,0,4.45,1.34,0,0.22,0.89,0.45,0,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.67,0.89,0,0,0,0,0,1.56,7.13,10.02,1.11,1.34,5.57,2,0,0.89,2.67,4.68,7.13,0.45,0.89,0.67,0.45,0,0,18.04,6.46,3.56,0.89,0.22,2,4.9,

Do I have to worry about pirated software accessing the internet and leaking my IP?,"A good idea when using any pirated software is to shut off it's access to the internet.you dont have to do anything you dont want to, friendExposing your IP address through software or games phoning home is a legitimate concern.I think Microsoft generates complaints for pirate copies of their games that way. I don't know that for a fact, but I've seen people post about getting a letter from their ISP with their VPN configured correctly and it's often a Microsoft title.Easy solution, just run your VPN when using pirate software or games.  If that's a problem for whatever reason, alternately firewall the exe.Thanks for the response. I think I'm going to run the games in a VM to avoid any problems.  Malware isn't exactly a huge concern for me as I keep everything secure and have backups of all my data, but I really want to avoid some serious headaches with my service provider.
Specifically them dropping me from their service. Thanks for the advice!Ok so, there are some stories going around of something similar happening to some people. Usually, the stories and warnings I keep getting from secure experts and stuff like that, are that pirated software, depending on where you download it from, may contain malware to steal information or turn you pc into a bot. Not every pirated stuff will get you in this kind of trouble, you just have to find good sources for whatever you want.If you're scared of something happening to you then you can just don't download the game or program you want OR, if you have the resources and knowledge, run the thing on a virtual machine and monitor the connection for some anomaly. Setting up a firewall, like mentioned here, may also help.Sorry for typos, I'm using my phone now and I'm kinda sleepy.Firewalls are you friendThank you for the in-depth response. I understand the game companies are the ones who file a report to the ISP, but I've just been more paranoid lately as I used a shitty VPN not too long ago to torrent a game (Diablo 2) and the connection dropped midway and leaked my IP. Long story short, I got one of ""those"" emails from my ISP and I just really want to avoid pissing them off and end up having them drop me from their service.Because of the first scare, I've just become a lot more conscious (paranoid is probably a better way to put it) of what could go wrong and want to avoid it. Thank you for the advice. I'll try the VM route and see how that goes, for now. Thanks again.If you run a piece of software that phones home and tells the game company you’re running pirated software, your isp has nothing to do with it. The isp letters people get have to do with how they got the game, ie they used their public ip to download something over a torrent using their isps connection. Simply having and running the software does not implicate your isp, just like if you put the game on a flash drive and gave it to your cousin Jimmy on the other side of the country. If he boots the game, isp dgaf. But if you are still worried about your isp or think that instead of simply phoning home that the software may be malicious (valid concern),It would be recommended to isolate these different activities in different vms, (use one vm just for torrents and then use the files/programs you dl on another vm). Unless it’s a game or something that can’t run well in a vm, I would keep all your pirated software off the host machine when possible. In many cases, you can set up a vm with no network connection whatsoever and run your software there.If you want to be even more sure you don’t have any leaks, you may want to consider whonix or tails on one of your vms which routes all 100% network activity over tor. It is possible to virtualize windows and run windows software from within whonix. Your download speeds will be considerably diminished if you go this route.Both options (especially the second one) are probably overkill for seasoned users who know what they can get away with, but if you’re worried these are some options. I would still recommend keeping as much ill-gotten software off your host as you can as a general rule to everyone.",20,749,0.02670227,0.02670227,1,756,42.52,52.69,48.09,23.57,31.5,19.71,90.74,70.24,58.33,16.14,10.58,3.57,0,5.03,0.13,1.59,5.56,15.74,7.01,1.06,13.1,8.33,5.69,7.41,1.59,16.67,4.37,3.7,1.19,0.4,0.53,0.4,16.93,1.06,15.87,2.12,2.38,2.38,5.82,0.66,5.03,0,3.84,1.98,1.72,1.59,0.26,1.32,0.79,0.53,0,0.53,12.43,3.84,1.32,0.53,0.26,0.13,2.65,7.8,0.13,0.26,0,0.4,5.56,0,0,5.56,3.57,1.59,0.66,1.32,0,0,0.53,0.4,0.13,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0.79,1.06,1.59,0.26,0,0.13,0,1.06,0,5.03,8.07,0.13,2.51,5.16,0.4,0,0,1.98,1.32,5.03,2.12,0.53,0.4,0.13,0,0,13.36,4.63,3.97,0,0.13,2.51,2.12,

"Do gamers critique video games too much as if they're appreciating the effort put into a software product, in which new features per hour spent is more important than the experience as a whole?","Part of the problem is that gaming's target audience traditionally hasn't been the kind of people who you would expect to want to or be able to offer an artistic critique. Teenage boys with disposable income aren't known for their ability to break down a piece of artwork, at least not in a metaphorical sense.That's because a lot of people don't see games as art and are closer to toys. Especially when you're talking about more multiplayer focused things. Like I could tell you all kinds of technical gameplay things in Guilty Gear. Which matchups are good or bad, frame data for my character, which moves signify the end of a blockstring for others, etc. But I don't know anything about the story.sorry but your comment comes off as pretentious to me. There are some games that can be considered art but the medium itself in general is not a platform for it. This is the nature of the medium. On top of that this discussion about ART always makes it sound like being ART is somehow better than not being art. It is not that big of a deal whether a game is art or not.Because video games are both a younger and faster evolving medium than film and music it makes sense that there are more issues around the mundane stuff. Film reviews don't normally talk about whether the actors are in focus or whether you can actually hear the dialog because it's just expected that you will unless you're making some sort of art house movie (or you're Christopher Nolan). If it was common for films to have serious technical issues on release (e.g. scenes got repeated or short segments were upside down, impossible to see or dubbed into Swahili) then film reviewers would have to spend much more time warning about these kind of mundane problems. That's where we are with a lot of video games. So much time has to be spent discussing very boring things like frame rates because it can make games essentially unplayable. Hopefully we can get to a point where certain things like performance, bugs, accessibility, etc are just solved and only get discussion by exception.I agree with your assessment, OP. In my brief time reentering the gaming world after a 7 year hiatus I have come to think that the gaming community as a whole has a very underdeveloped language for appreciation compared to other communities like fans of film or music. It makes sense considering how young gaming is as a medium, but it still makes me really depressed seeing the detatched way so many people on gaming forums and subreddits describe their experience playing games, with a restricted focus on the most basic and mundane aspects of a game without focusing on broader thematic elements. I see so many descriptions of isolated gaming mechanics and why the writer found them fun or frustrating, but comparatively few discussions on how different game mechanics intersect to create a unique experience, or tell a unique story, or provide a unique perspective on the world.To start with the food analogy, I think I was saying generally the opposite. That if you have filet mignon for every meal, then even the best filet mignon in the world will make you shrug, and you'll probably be reductionist in your thinking to ""in the end, I'm just chewing and feeling the juices seep into my mouth. Definitely isn't as good as the first time"".You could say that about every game that has come out these days though most use the same style in their respective genre with few subcategories. Yeah the art may look different but its the same core gameplay principles we've had for decades. Gamers make it seem like its only AAA that are doing this when the low budget games are doing it even moreso.Im sorry to hit you with the food analogy but in regards to your charitable monologue of a game, if I haven’t eaten in 5 days I might view old rice cakes more charitably than I do right now. I don’t think that necessarily speaks to the quality of rice cakes.I think this is an unfair view of a certain kind of game and gamer. There's no reason to think this 'top level' is where the heart of the experience is. I'd say a lot of the time, a game's setting and story is just meaningless fluff. The bottom layer is where learning, experimentation, challenge, and creative expression can happen. A lot of people find those more meaningful than whatever paper-thin fantasy the story is trying to sell.Because videogames are ultimately an interactive medium, and so the middle and bottom layer need to be good alongside the top layer. That doesn't mean the video games with a lot less interactivity are inferior games, in case of walking Sims and visual novels, those products often make up for their lack of the lower tow layers with an excellently executed top one, from the settings to the environments and story telling, these games try to compensate for their lack of interaction.Really nailed most of my thoughts with your reply here. One thing I'm not too clear on though is:Witcher 3 is a great example to this. That is a game with decent gameplay. Nothing groundbraking or amazing but it is good enough and works well with top the middle and top layer. The game shines with it's world, story, characters, presentation.Because the mechanics and interactivity are ultimately what define the gaming genre from film, books, etc. The ""top"" and ""middle"" layers usually need to be engaged in the context of the ""bottom"" layer. Games that have mechanical themes interwoven in the other layers get brownie points. It's a self-selection. Gamers are going to focus on the interactivity of the product from the outset.Skull and bones is a new game building off a part of black flag. I think you’re wrong to think people want BF with a (barely) different theme, it’s that they want BF without all the AC stuff, actually focusing on the one thing they really liked in it (so middle/lower level for you). It’s more about expanding something they found simple but effective, trimming the fat, and/or getting more of the same good thing, than themes at all. Personally I got sick of the AC shit before even getting to roam the seas so I was interested in Skull n Bones to actually engage with what people praised.But that's the fun of art right? No one knows if freeze framing through a movie will get you clues, but people decided to do it for Stanley Kubrick movies and they've written books about it.I think you’re right. Certain types of games lean so heavily on specific mechanical and narrative conventions that, for a seasoned gamer, it’s obvious what is about to happen or what the player needs to do next. Personally, the games I’ve enjoyed the most in the last few years have been able to change the formula enough that it didn’t feel like playing a pallet swapped version of some game I liked a few years ago. The number of games I’ve dropped because they failed to give me something new has also increased substantially in the last ten years.I've been chewing on an idea lately. I think there are games that get more interesting the more genre-savvy you are, and games that get less interesting.",9,1256,0.007165605,0.007165605,1,1258,59.6,17.52,60.28,37.37,28.59,17.17,90.14,71.38,56.28,11.76,5.48,2.54,0.24,1.75,0,0.87,6.28,16.38,8.43,0.56,14.07,9.14,6.12,7.31,1.51,16.77,8.66,5.48,1.99,0.56,1.19,0.24,17.01,1.11,15.82,3.18,2.23,1.75,2.94,0.95,6.2,0,3.18,2.15,0.95,1.35,0.87,0.48,0,0.08,0.08,0.08,7.15,3.34,0.48,0.08,0,0.24,2.07,3.82,0,0.16,0.08,0.24,1.19,0,0,1.19,7.39,5.72,0.08,1.03,0.64,0,1.51,0.24,0.08,0,0.08,0,0,0.72,0,0.4,0.32,0.79,0.16,0.16,0.08,0.08,0.08,0.4,5.72,8.66,0.72,0.64,5.88,0.87,0.32,0.48,2.86,2.31,6.52,1.43,0.4,0.24,0.16,0,0,13.04,4.77,3.42,0.08,0,3.02,1.75,

Does the presence of software bugs means that the developers didn’t really finish the job? Or is there more to it than that?,"If you define ""finishing the job"" as delivering a 100% bug-free program then the presence of any bugs is evidence for the job not being finished, but that's somewhat circular.Alpha and Beta testing are not there to find bugs. In good development organisations, bug-hunting happens way earlier, i.e. unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests.Makes sense to me, thank you!Bugs are hard to detect. That’s why they have alpha and beta testing in order to find the bugs. Sometimes it’s just that the bug got missed. Sometimes it’s a time issue. Like if a bug requires very specific and rare conditions to appear and the consequences aren’t that bad, they might just say it’s not worth it to fix.Even NASA software have bugs, the difference is NASA programmers spend inordinate amount of time to consider possible interactions and try to account for it all.Thank you!

"EV shipping is set to blow internal combustion engines out of the water - more than 40% of the world’s fleet of containerships could be electrified “cost-effectively and with current technology,” by the end of this decade","Now THIS is some shit I can get on board to. Not using tampon fucking straws to drink my PepsiNo dataNow the question is how long will they take to charge in Port?  If we are talking days instead of hours then all that effecieny benefit is lost.Buuuuut the price right now is 0.50 per kWh not 0.03……I recently watched a video by Casual Navigation, and he was explaining the reason we aren't already seeing much for innovation on large ships. The ships are owned by one company, and they pay for the ship and any upgrades. The ships are operated, and fuel paid for, by another. Neither one wants to pay for something they won't see a profit on. And then, regulation is a problem. If just the country the ship operates from changes its laws regarding shipping fuel laws, the ships will just leave and 'operate' from a different country. This is one downside to global capitolism, it's very hard to regulate individuals.Researchers studying the costs of the electrification of container ships have found that over 40% of the world's container ships would be cheaper to operate if they moved away from environmentally damaging heavy fuel oils (HFO) to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and/or nickel manganese cobalt oxide battery powered electrical propulsion. The researchers' conclusions were shown to be financially advantageous even before they took into account the environmental savings of switching away from highly polluting HFO fuels. The levelized cost of the 300MW charging stations needed to 'refuel' the ships come in at a scant $0.03 per kWh. The total cost of propulsion was analyzed for a broad range of ship sizes and route lengths. Projected future declines in battery costs suggest that in the near future, we will see cost-effective electrified ships that can travel 5,000km+ routes. However, if we account for the cost of environmental damage of burning HFOs for ocean freight, the current economical range of electrified ships is ALREADY over 5000km. Recent and ongoing improvements to batteries, inverters and electric motors have produced a paradigm shift. Electrified ships capable of traveling 20,000km or more are now entirely feasible from an engineering standpoint. Oceangoing ICE technology is all but dead ... (long live the ICE!)The worlds largest shipping company Mærsk is currently developing and building power to fuel tech inorder to lower their CO2 footprint in the next decade with a goal of Netzero on all their ships by 2050. Essentially they are using Methanol as the battery in this case. So a lower footprint shipping industry is very much possible.Yeah I just bought a new car last year, and I went for a regular combustion engine. Mayyybe the next time I shop again in five years or so, I'll consider an EV. For one thing, I feel like the infrastructure isn't there for it yet in terms of charging stations. But what I really want before I am fully on board with EVs is legislation that prevents anybody from being able to prevent me from driving my car when I want to and where I want to. Unless that happens (or they outlaw combustion engine cars completely), I'll never go full EV. And I know I'm not alone there.In a world where it’s already a hassle to find an electrical shore tie, I’d say you’re pretty much on the money. Most ships I’ve worked aboard never secure their generators unless in home port. Additionally, most of the other various ships I see moored up still have some form of generator running at the pier. I’m not calling the long term ambition impossible- but it’s definitely an uphill battle.Unless the U.S. Navy was investing in it, I don't believe it. Their Aircraft carriers are all nuclear.No dataNo one considers the effects of the supply and demand on cost when these ""renewable"" energy industries begin buying up metal commodities. Can we even scale up raw material production at this point?Your not. Unless I’m missing something the energy density to weight issue isn’t there yet. I’m familiar with marine ev tech at sailboat scale and it’s not good enough for passage. It’s good enough for limited use/range but not at this scale.Maybe I'm jaded, but I'll believe it when I see it.Recent and ongoing improvements to batteries, inverters and electric motors have produced a paradigm shift. Electrified ships capable of traveling 20,000km or more are now entirely feasible from an engineering standpoint. Oceangoing ICE technology is all but dead ... (long live the ICE!) The total cost of propulsion was analyzed for a broad range of ship sizes and route lengths. Projected future declines in battery costs suggest that in the near future, we will see cost-effective electrified ships that can travel 5,000km+ routes. However, if we account for the cost of environmental damage of burning HFOs for ocean freight, the current economical range of electrified ships is ALREADY over 5000km. The levelized cost of the 300MW charging stations needed to 'refuel' the ships come in at a scant $0.03 per kWh. Researchers studying the costs of the electrification of container ships have found that over 40% of the world's container ships would be cheaper to operate if they moved away from environmentally damaging heavy fuel oils (HFO) to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and/or nickel manganese cobalt oxide battery powered electrical propulsion. The researchers' conclusions were shown to be financially advantageous even before they took into account the environmental savings of switching away from highly polluting HFO fuels.

"Ethereum Mining Is Going Away, and Miners Are Not Happy - The shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake will cut power consumption sharply—and leave some expensive technology searching for new uses.","How dare you laugh at all of those people whose only wish was to be a hard to tax millionaire while doing very little work and contributing nothing to societyI’m minting the worlds smallest violiNFT just for them.Maybe they could work on climate changeThis article wants us to feel bad for an arbitrary system that rewards wanton destruction of the environment. Shame on this journalist.I was a bit less apathetic I went with 'good, fuck em'Miners aren't happy?  Oh no Anyway...Searching for uses is admitting it’s a solution in search of a problem.  Almost all of the problems blockchain “solves” could be solved more efficiently with other solutions.Like mining other crypto?there's also cloud based rendering, renting out computation, scientific computation renting alot of other uses for the cards than just cryptoThey don't need to search for new uses when plenty of old uses are right there waiting.well.... just be more than careful buying used. You dont want a system with a gpu abused by mining whose fans barely work anymore, (and could have other issues despite might seem to work) unless you are prepared and skilled enough to refurbish. Youll just end up getting a card that frequently crashes your system.anytime now..Can I finally upgrade my 970??They'll find another shitcoin to mine""...leave some expensive technology searching for new uses"" Or, weirdly, the uses they were designed for in the first place, AKA running Crysis at the highest possible graphics settingsWaiting for a 3090 to dip below $400Gaming rigs incoming!!Honestly when tho? I’ve been mining small scale for a few years and keep wondering when it’s time to wrap it upThey did and have been actively fighting it for years. Oh well lolI remember it POS being "" less than 12 months away"" back in summer of 2016, so yea. No sympathy lol.I'm curious how cryptobros will change their stance on centralization since proof-of-stake is a centralizing process.Far longer than that, which is why I won't believe PoS is happening until it happens.Never understood the people pouring into eth rigs Its been right around the corner for years too, it just kept getting pushed backIt’s been on display at your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for 50 of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss about it now.My country has talked about giving up on burning peat for heat... for 30 years. Yet every step taken towards stopping use it has come as a shock to peat producers - all of them had JUST bought new equipment with massive loans and stopping burning of beat will lead them to bankruptcy, and surely to ruin greenhouses and farms with animals since they got their peat from same producers that made it for incineration. It has only been in the works for 30 years, the talks started around the fall of the Berlin wall and collapse of soviet union. During this countless lakes and rivers been polluted beyond repair. Clear pristine waters with sandy bottoms, are now brown with sludge bottom. Internet explorer's end of life was announced 2015; yet there were people who woke up 2 weeks ago shocked that their systems didn't work. Apparently a big problem in Japan where whole government services just stopped working. So yeah... They only had 4 years to prepare. That is like nothing on the scale of the general fuckery that happens on these matters.Actually since ETHs inception, it was always planned to move to proof of stake.This has been in talks since at least 2018, if Eth miners didn’t know this was coming, it’s on them",24,636,0.037735849,0.037735849,1,626,57.99,35.49,69.48,31.18,31.3,19.49,86.42,70.93,53.67,10.06,5.27,1.44,0.16,1.28,0,1.92,4.79,11.82,4.79,2.24,16.77,9.58,8.79,5.27,1.76,17.89,7.83,6.39,3.51,0.48,2.72,0.48,14.86,1.6,13.1,3.04,3.19,1.6,2.4,0.48,3.04,0.16,3.67,2.08,1.28,1.28,0.48,0.48,0,0,0,0.32,6.55,1.92,0.32,0,0.32,0.32,0.8,4.31,0,0,0,0,1.12,0.16,0.16,0.8,3.83,0,0,2.72,1.28,0,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16,0.48,0.96,0,0.48,0,0.16,0.32,1.6,5.75,9.42,1.12,1.76,5.91,0.64,0,0.48,7.35,5.91,6.23,1.92,1.12,0.64,0.32,0.32,0,15.81,6.87,2.72,0.8,0.32,3.04,2.08,

Getting the names of your Linux software RAID devices to stick,"How 'bout md RAID under LVM or even without LVM. E.g. /boot - no LVM, but yes md RAID - and GRUB handles md raid1 fine too ... so, redundant drives, either could fail entirely and all will still boot, and with LVM atop md raid1, can have all be raid1 protected. Also, with LVM atop md, can have different PEs with different types of RAID or even non-RAID ... and change LV RAID types with a simple matter of pvmove.  Setting up pools and/or tagging can also make that easier to track and clearly see what's what.Why use LVM if you just want raid without snapshots, volume groups, thin volumes and so on? I love LVM but for such tasks it's just overkill. Besides many people more familiar with mdadm than with LVM toolsetLVM does it internally using MD, and then uses some LVM metadata. But the physical disk allocation and storage is MD either way The benefit is not dealing with LVM. As useful as it is, some people don't want that hassle and just want to put stuff on a diskIs there really any reason these days to use MD raid over LVM (which uses names)? Is there anything MD raid can do that LVM can't?Or you could just use /dev/md/$name. I think listing arrays in mdadm.conf is an anti-pattern. The authoritative configuration for what constitutes an array is the metadata in the array components themselves. An array definition in mdadm.conf is either redundant, or it's wrong.",28,254,0.110236221,0.110236221,1,253,30.41,8.35,21.83,43.83,18.07,14.23,71.94,63.24,52.17,7.51,1.98,0.79,0,0.79,0,0.4,5.53,10.28,3.95,1.19,11.86,9.49,8.7,11.86,1.58,15.02,5.93,4.35,0.79,0,0.4,0.4,21.34,1.58,19.76,1.58,4.35,3.95,3.16,1.19,8.3,0,2.37,1.98,0.4,0.4,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,3.56,1.19,0,0,0,0.79,0,2.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,0,0.79,0,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.19,0,0,0,0,0.4,0.4,0,5.14,6.32,0,0.79,5.14,0.4,0,0,1.19,0,7.91,0.4,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,21.34,8.3,4.74,1.19,0,2.37,4.74,

HBO Max's automated technical support message......to an HBO Max tweet,"LMAOBeep boop, maggot. -HBOMaxHelp, probablyWelp, someone's gotta add an if-request I guessThere was, until David Zaslav took it away just to save 3 billion dollarsI’m trying to get HBO on my dragon, is there an App for that??I figured it was a spite/sarcastic tweet for the same reasonSo are they required to answer every tweet that mentions HBO?? What indicates that the HBO max account needs “help”Don't you think it's just a shitty bot that's triggered by the word ""down""?I dunno. Nothing prompts them to answer directly to the HBOMax tweet, not a mention or anything.Is AM not automated message?What’s sadder is there is a very real possibility that there’s a person who sent that tweet, and had to send it.they probably meant to reply to a reply but instead replied to the main tweetAnywaysOh YeahOh noProbably did and someone touched one small part of the legacy code.Imagine if we could figure out a way to make a list of accounts that a bot shouldn't trigger on.Heyyy, be nice, those kids with no experience are fresh out of college.

"HEAVY TRAFFIC. #FSDBeta v10.69 blew me away this morning. I tried to throw everything I had at this version, and this is what it did. Every turn was not perfect, but if this is what we can do with good engineering. The future is bright for this technology.","Wow! 🤩If this is consistent and repeatable, call me impressed!HOLY SHIT!!This is something that cities would usually fill in that median to prevent lefts there.Yeah, super dangerous. Not extremely common in the states though. Especially not at this scale.Impressive watch with done highlights 6:15 was good crossing 9:14 was great crossing into median 9:50 was too delayed from median into lane 10:57 was great decision NOT to go 13:56 was good crossing 14:50 was fantasticI personally think that it should've crept out to the other lanes a bit slower, since I am not sure if it 100% would have known that the other 2 lanes past the truck that let him out were totally clear. This is a common situation that when people by courtesy let others through and accidents happen. I would have been more comfortable if it went out a bit slower and then onto the median. Impressive nonetheless!Maybe I'm looking at the wrong part, but the other car stopped because they didn't want to block the traffic trying to cross. There was traffic stopped ahead.Not sure what the laws are, but when that car stopped to let him out, should the car have crept forward into that lane? Or is that too assertive?Software is very squishy, there are hard limits but often with methodological improvements, performance will improve.Think about it, could you steer the car based only the multi-camera view? I think after some practice it is totally doable.I have always been cautiously pessimistic about FSD but consider me impressed. My prediction of ""not without a significant hardware update"" has changed to ""hmmm, you know what, it just might"". Now I think I understand why they raised the price to $15k. Still too expensive, though.Yeah I don't look at many FSD videos but see all the posts giving hate on FSD and just assume it sucks. Then I see something like this and wow, genuinely impressive - many human drivers would be stuck at that junction forever, or just take a right and find another way around.That was legitimately impressive.also: turning left here is what a completely inexperienced person would doAs a person with fsd beta, my current version sacres the hell out of me when I use it. It brakes way too late and uses the brakes more than using the regen. It feels nauseating to be in it. On top of that, it's squirrelly when it hesitates to make left hand turns. Right turns are better since the camera has decent view of incoming cars.I have a somewhat unique perspective on this as I have a 14 year old daughter learning to drive and FSD Beta. I'm constantly comparing them. So far FSD is better but to be fair she only got her learners license a month ago. We'll see if/when she surpasses itPretty sure an inexperienced teenage driver would do worse with this kind of traffic. I guess we’ve passed that point now. Impressed.Really? My European mind knows 2 similar intersections within 10km radius.It’s terrible, that’s why it is kinda famous as Chucks left turn. It was a known case they wanted to tackleYeah it's pretty awful.  I've had to deal with a slightly smaller version - two lanes each way, median, pretty fast speed limit on the major road and some times of day it's just not worth it to sit there hoping to make the left.It looks like god damn frogger!I have a one lane version of it at one of the Mcdonalds in my city, and it stresses me the fuck out everytimeI would just turn right and turn around somewhere, who wants to turn left across 3 lanes of traffic? I wonder if FSD would actually make such considerations in the futureFlorida has that kind of crap all over the place. Local drivers know to be wary driving in the leftmost lane for drivers launching themselves into their lane just in front of them. Yes, very unsafe. We don't have that in California - our major roads are just as wide, but they have medians and we do a lot of u-turns instead. Which means that local drivers are very aware when making right hand turns at such intersections to watch for people doing u-turns. The bottom line is that when driving in a different state/country, just be aware there are local traffic patterns that you need to be cautious about.Wtf is that intersection? My european mind is having a strokeyeah he definitely trusted the car and let go a few times, joining traffic from the middle line with obstructed visibility for him, the car so confident that he just let it do it's thing, inflection point imo for FSD.Wow chuck, impressive. Even more impressed that you trusted it to do its thing! I wonder how you get confident in that scenario when you cannot see around the vehicle, but the car can. That one will probably trip up a lot of people for awhile.Please review our resources below.

Help me save this upgrade! Debian wheezy to debian buster disaster. (Linux software RAID + Grub),"Let me get this straight. This is possibly a production server, but either way this has vital data on it that OP wants to rescue. You are suggesting to degrade the array, which means that if ANY changes are done on it, it will force a rebuild which is one of the riskiest things you can do on a RAID array. Considering the age of the server, this may result in catastrophic data loss which is exactly what OP wants to avoid. When dealing with issues like these, one of the first rules is to never do anything that you can't undo or recover from.They're all raid 1's (mirrors).  I've even reconciled /proc/mdstat and the partitions (fdisk -l /dev/sdX)  everything is the same.  I can't find any hidden partition, or unallocated space, or anything that could determine why grub isn't working like it's supposed to. Even the drives themselves, no SMART errors, all functional and present.  Nothing shows up in lsusb (outside of the rescue media, but that's expected).Just curious, can raid unplugged? so that you can just use a single hard drive? Maybe it's something hidden on a raid disk???This is sound advice, on servers that run windows. Literally the reason i decided to go to Linux for machines that i own when back i the days i was managing windows servers and like 5 to 10% of them broke down after every update. Like iirc 19h2 or something gave me problems on about 80 out of 600 of my servers, it was a f-ing slaughter. Like to this day i still haven't fully understood 0x8007371b. Debian otoh doesn't really do that, and if for some reason it does you can either just fix it manually or restore a snapshot.this is a huge non-sense in Debian's world. Debian is built the way so it can be properly upgraded, repeatedly and cleanly (of course, unless admin makes the system messy).Never upgrade an OS. Even when it works it's a mess. Always start over. Or even better: Don't touch it if the old OS is still supported.Not an expert on rebuilding grub under an mdraid array as luckily it never happened to me with a boot disk, but i would advise unplugging at least 1 raid disk as to so save the data, and then try to boot passing explicitly 4.6 as an argument. if that still doesn't let you boot, you can just ho ahead and make it work with a live iso. As much as mdam is a little bit gimmicky, it Is perfectly able to rebuild a mirror starting from scratch with only one disk, should the worst happen. Sorry if this is trivial advice, but this should at least give you a number of chances to screw up equal to the number of mirrors you have -1 (although I'd rather work with 2 sets of 2 mirrors to avoid as much as possible a rebuild)It sounds like the rescue prompt is looking at one of the members only, and it happens to be out of sync. I can't help you with the specifics of the md issues, but one thing you could do is to chroot into the main volume, and re-create /boot (either (backup and!) nuke the existing partitions, or make it on an external drive) https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/390090/21941 You'd also probably want to update fstab to point to the new / temporary /boot device This would let you get the system booting using a known good mbr, grub install, grub config, kernel and initrd.This machine is posessed.  It's working now.  I'm not sure why or how. The whole point of the upgrade was to evacuate it and after that, I'm destroying this machine.Just notes: never to upgrade across versions, do 7->8->9->10. I recommend rebooting after upgrade have rescue CD/usb stick (installation images can be used that way)Is the boot set to UEFI or MBR? BTW ""grub-install"" only takes care of the code to start GRUB, but doesn't actually updates the GRUB menu. That's handled by grub-update. Launch it and see what kernels and roots it detects. Also check the file at /boot/grub/grub.cnf if it's the same menu options you get during boot, if not then you're booting to some stale GRUB installation that doesn't point to the root you're working in.",26,724,0.035911602,0.035911602,1,740,42.1,12.16,28.56,27.38,23.13,15.41,80.27,67.16,56.49,13.38,5,2.43,0,2.16,0,0.41,8.38,14.19,7.43,3.38,13.38,9.86,5.81,8.38,2.57,16.08,4.59,3.51,2.84,0.41,1.49,1.08,16.62,1.49,15.14,1.62,1.89,3.24,4.73,1.08,5.95,0.14,3.51,2.03,1.49,0.41,0.14,0.27,0,0.14,0,0,5.14,2.43,1.62,0,0.27,0,0.68,2.7,0,0,0,0,0.81,0,0,0.81,1.62,0,0.27,1.35,0,0,0.54,0.27,0,0.14,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.14,0.41,0.54,0,0.14,0,0,1.08,0.14,4.86,5.68,0.27,0.81,3.38,0.68,0.27,0.27,4.05,1.76,7.57,1.08,0.68,0.68,0,0,0,20.95,5.27,4.46,0.81,0.14,3.65,6.62,

"Hey Reddit, I’m Hoss Hassani, VP of the EV Charging Ecosystem at GM. We’re on a journey to get everybody in an electric vehicle– and it all starts with ownership education. From technology strategy to charging accessibility and GM's product lineup, I'm here to answer your EV questions. AMA below!","If everyone is in an EV, the power grid will be unable to handle that much draw. How do you see an EV in every garage as being possible? What about the roads and the gas tax that helps maintain them? How do you suggest compensating a trip in an EV when it will take so much longer to charge than it does to fill up with gas? Please explain how charging an EV with fossil fuel electricity is so much better? I love the technology but I struggle with the reality we face if there is full in EV adoption.We address this with our Ultium energy recovery system, which keeps batteries warmer than the outside temperature and protects battery efficiency in cold weather. We tested our Ultium recovery system at -30 degrees C in GM’s testing chambers in Milford, Michigan.Is battery performance still dependent on outside temperature? A few years back we had a cold spell in the California Hi-Desert. Many fully charged EVs (Nissans, Toyotas, Chevys)were only getting  around 13 miles per charge. rather than their usual 300+ miles. Many owners were stranded and upset. Has this problem been addressed?GREAT QUESTION. First, our EVs are engineered to work in all climates and our cold weather testing facility is actually in Northern Ontario where it gets...crispy. Like, nostril-sticking crispy. We're also working with our dealers on the Dealer Community Charging Program to expand EV infrastructure in MANY underserved communities, including northern and exurban communities. Combine that with our home charging programs, included standard installation for eligible Bolt purchasers, and you'll see what we mean when we say we want everybody in an EV.How will EV infrastructure be able to serve northern communities where long distances and frigid cold weather are obstacles? (Specifically thinking of the northern territories in Canada and Rural Parts of British Columbia).Bauser, for a person who dominates, we need to work on your fact sources. Who is telling you the batteries last 5-8 years? That is what us wannabe southerners call hogwash, and i love both hogs and washing. There's also considerable demand for second-use of batteries after they're done moving someone around in a car. And EVs can at times be an asset for the grid.. Heck, you can even potentially power your AC with your EV when the lights go out. Sooo, c'mon bauser, show EVs some love.How do you feel about getting everyone into vehicles that will last an average of 5-8 years before needing a new battery that will cost more than the car is worth? Can your EV batteries be safely and readily recycled? How will the US energy grid handle your goal of getting everyone in an EV when I can't even handle everyone using AC in the summer?With dealerships adding “dealer markups” to all new vehicles and some are effectively doubling the cost of EVs what does GM intend to do to stop this practice ? I want an EV but with what dealerships are charging this is going to significantly delay the adoption of EVs. I’ve been in the market for an EV for about 6 months and I have yet to find a dealer that will order the car I want and sell it for less than double MSRP.We're piloting this with PG&E. The pilot will include bidirectional hardware and software-defined communications protocols that will enable power to flow from a charged EV into a person's home, automatically coordinating between the EV, home and PG&E’s electric supply. After lab testing, we plan to test vehicle-to-home interconnection allowing some homes to safely receive power from the EV when power stops flowing from the grid.When it comes to bidirectional charging, what does the future look like with GM? I think for my spouse and I, bidirectional charging will likely be a huge motivator in purchasing our next vehicles.The Volt will always have a special place in our heart, but we're all in on all-electric.Will the Chevy Volt return? I think we would actually need to transition. A PHEV would actually let people transition. My line of thinking is that there are more gas stations than charging stations now and if we want an effective transition, we would want a car that could transition to electric when everything else is ready.We've done PHEV, EREV, HEV... basically, all the EVs. The Cadillac CT6 was a true PHEV and the Chevy Volt was an Extended Range EV (a different kind of PHEV). The Volt launched in 2010 and had a great run for eight years, but with the Bolt in market and a battery of BEVs coming (see what we did there), we're focusing on giving customers the best that all-electric offers, including reliability, low maintenance costs and optimum range.Why haven’t you done a PHEV?May I suggest the Chevy Bolt EV? I used to drive a black-on-black Malibu which was a thing of beauty, but switching to a Bolt was the best choice I made.Will there be an EV version of the Malibu or Cruze within the next few years? Or some sort of small to mid-sized sedan? EVs are beyond my price range right now, but I plan on trading my current 2018 Malibu in for a hybrid sometime within the next few months. You guys got rid of the hybrid Malibu, so I now have no choice but to go with Honda or Toyota (I do NOT want an SUV.). Once I'm done with my hybrid in a few years I might seriously consider going back to GM if they have an EV sedan that's reasonably priced and has a decent mileage range.The good news about lithium is that it’s fairly abundant and we are working with companies like Controlled Thermal Resources (CTR) to extract lithium using closed loop systems that help to minimize impact. We’re also focused on recycling. GM will work to recycle or reuse 100% of the batteries that come back to us and we plan to maximize the content of recycled materials in our new batteries to reduce dependence on mining and other forms of raw material extraction.What is the environmental impact of scaling up the amount of lithium mining required to sell EVs on this mass scale planned? My guess is it will negate the entire purpose of EVs, has this been part of the discussion?On that note where is the Cobalt, Lithium, and other Rare Earth Metals being mined for Ultium batteries, primarily focusing on the ethics.",52,1090,0.047706422,0.047706422,1,1095,66.7,66.37,51.71,43.34,24.89,20,78.54,64.57,52.69,11.32,6.94,2.28,2.92,1.19,0,0.37,4.38,14.61,7.85,1.28,13.79,9.13,5.57,6.03,0.46,14.52,6.39,5.21,6.67,3.56,1.83,1.28,11.42,1.19,10.14,2.19,2.1,1.64,2.1,0.46,3.01,0,2.1,1.83,0.27,0.46,0.37,0.09,0,0,0.09,0,8.13,2.01,0.27,0.09,0,0.18,0.82,6.12,0.09,0,0,0.09,1.46,0.37,0.09,1,3.65,0,0.46,1.83,1.55,0,0.55,0.27,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.37,0.55,1,0,0.37,0,0.18,0.09,0,4.93,9.5,0.37,1.19,7.21,0.55,0,0.73,4.11,2.19,4.75,2.56,0.09,0.09,0,0,0.09,14.34,4.47,3.38,1.83,0,1.74,2.92,
"Hey guys, I’m in the market for a mini 3 pro but I’ve heard that it’s got a number of software bugs, the main one I’m concerned about is the range issue bug. So I would like to know from any current mini 3 pro owners if it is still apparent or if it has been patched (with the DJI rc w/screen ofc)","Hijacking this comment, they recently released an update that's supposed to fix some of the range issues.Everything has been fixed with firmware and software updates.How high and far can you legally fly? Keeping in mind altitude regulations and the visual line of sight requirement? Then decide if the range issue is an issue.Your an owner right? So if I go 2km will I not have any random drop outs or glitches, provided I’m in an optimal environment and I’m on the right signal channelIts been fixed, the normal remote goes a little further in tests i’ve seen but not enough to worry about.The Mini 3 Pro is a new product and has brand new firmware. So we can expect several software bugs like in other complicated devices. As with our smartphones and computers. We can also expect that there will be some lemons from production issues.Alr man thanksI just got mine this last week and have flown it twice.

Hot take: Software suites should be more accepted in the Unix community.,"Also, I used UNIX, because it's the unix philosphy of a program doing a single thing well.My family used to have a seperate DVD player, I never heard of DVD-TVs.I assume, it's a DVD player integrated into a TV?Remember DVD-TVs or VCR-TVs? If one breaks you replace both.Why does one need the whole suite when 1 will do just fine. No point in having a complete office package if the only thing I'm doing is typing a term paper.not to mention, UNIX was designed to perform tasks that used minimal command names. I think you're confusing UNIX with Linux.I have mixed opinions personally.Unix has generally followed the ""do one thing well"" philosophy. If you want to perform another task, create another program to do that well etc. So big monolithic software suites do go against this principle.And in the case of Visual Studio, I do think it's better to split it. I'm a software dev, and know there's lots of different tools out there that all have different pros and cons. When you use a tool like VS, it removes your ability to choose. What if I want clang or GCC instead of MSVC? Tough! (I'll probably find there is a way to do this now, I'm not well versed with VS, but it'll almost certainly be difficult as MS want you to use MSVC).With that said, I think the Unix philosophy can be a little restrictive at times. If it's easier to combine similar small jobs into one software package, I think that makes sense. You just need to be careful to make sure it doesn't continue growing and become like X11, a big unmaintainable stack that's very hard to replace.Software suite means “collection of related computer programs”. Not that a program has lots of different functionality built-in.I believe that some people in the loonix community get triggered immediately when some software does one that more thing, even when it does it well. Some kind of Unix philosothingy they like to always preach about.You're mistaking with what you mean by ""Unix"" community is a vocal subset.I personally don't care about how the OS starts, provided its not awfully slow..offering a collection of related software is fine. good even. forcing people to install the whole collection for a single app is garbage. this is particularly felt with systemd and the joke of snaps being advertised as ""distro agnostic"" despite locking themselves out of many distros by linking themselves to systemdId say that the Linux / Unix-like community have split opinions on this topic - like most things tbh. A big part of that comes from how flexible these systems are - where there are choices there are differing opinions.For something like systemd, you can certainly see a lot of hate for it online, especially because those who like it don’t really talk about it, or need to. It’s the default on most Linux installs.Why systemd does have such controversy around it is that it goes against an old UNIX philosophy going back to Ken Thomson and Dennis Ritchie - namely programs should “Do one thing and do it well”Systemd does a dozen things, some better than others for sure. The real clash with Unix philosophy is that these things are not independent - the components depend on one another (see interlocked dependencies). One couldn’t say just have systemd init and forgo the rest of systemd. Additionally, other software began requiring systemd and the way it did things as a dependency (notably, GNOME). This makes source code less portable, especially to distros that don’t use systemd or to other Unix like systems like FreeBSD.This is in contrast to many other core components of a Unix-like system which may have drop in replacements - even if the functionality did not match entirely (glibc vs musl, gnu core utils vs busybox vs sbase)Personally as a more casual user, I don’t have an issue with systemd. I feel like I have to keep less in my head and systemctl makes services easier for me to manage.For others, they absolutely hate it, and if you want to read about some really purist stuff check out suckless. They’ve made some cool software over the years like dwm (which has been forked into things like i3, xmonad, awesome WM). They have pages dedicated to “rocks” aka software that meets their philosophy, and “sucks” aka popular software that does not. Here is there systemd page https://suckless.org/sucks/systemd/Maybe to not repeat the x11 problem. And still more than 10 years Linux can’t get rid of itLet's take for example systemd. It's an init system, a boot manager, a service manager and DNS resolver.Its also container manager, bootloader and efi manager, event logger, boot analyzer, its own fs mounter (systemd-mount), hardware database manager (systemd-hwdb), crypt setup manager (systemd-cryptsetup), partition manager (systemd-repart), vm detector (systemd-detect-virt), system images dissector (systemd-dissect), system user manager (systemd-sysusers), login manager (systemd-logind), date and time manager (systemd-timedated), locale manager (systemd-localed), display brightness manager (systemd-backlight), etc...it takes up a LOT of space, but nowadays, most people have a 500+ GB driveso you buy bigger drives to achieve the same or even less then with better software? what we need is better optimized software which works best in small chunks then giant monolithic codebases. (people often forget that systemd consists of multiple binaries which sadly depend on each other which really is the core problem). Think of the 90/early 2000 when you could fit a whole game into a eprom kilobytes in size and run it on a cpu clocked in the low MHz. it had all it needed (besides maybe higher resolution textures) to work properly.nowadays you end up with calculator apps needing a whole browser (electron) and a ton of bloated dependencies including 3 webservers one of which supports brotil, 5 log systems 4 of which not patched against log4shell, a vm mining bitcoin and three different implementations of trigonometric funtions. because some kid thought it could show it's supiroity by writing code no one can understand. (also corporations probably do it to get you to buy a new pc every few years to keep the holy beeing of consume happy and destroy the environment even further)software suites kill innovation by locking out support of different ideas like having the ability to offload tasks to different programms and making it impossible to use it's output as input by injecting lots of garbage or using obscoure formats. take MS Visual studio, all of it's functions can be replicated by a well configured vim but using a fraction of the space and resources.what we may need is better ways to share configurations and program chains for tech-analphabets (which shouldn't be allowed to use technology in my oppion, but that's another hot take)I guess you're taking about KISS (keep it simple stupid) ?",42,1144,0.036713287,0.036713287,1,1158,53.6,15.41,38.38,39.04,31.3,23.14,82.04,66.32,52.5,12.18,4.23,1.99,0.17,1.38,0,0.6,7.94,13.39,5.61,2.16,13.21,8.64,6.39,5.27,1.73,16.58,6.65,6.74,3.2,0.6,1.04,1.55,17.36,0.95,16.06,2.5,2.59,1.9,2.59,0.78,6.74,0.17,3.89,2.59,1.3,0.78,0.26,0.52,0,0.17,0.09,0,5.61,1.9,0.26,0.17,0.09,0,0.69,3.8,0,0,0.17,0,2.76,0.09,0,2.68,4.58,0.78,0,3.45,0.09,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.86,0.35,0.95,0.35,0.09,0.17,0,0.09,0.17,6.65,6.22,0.35,0.69,3.89,0.69,0.17,0.52,2.59,1.55,6.13,0.95,0.43,0.35,0.09,0,0,20.29,4.92,4.58,0.43,0.09,2.59,7.69,

How did you go about selling your software product to businesses? Boots on the ground sales? Sending materials? Cold calling?,"Exactly what you put in the contract.A REST api doesn't exist by itself in isolation. It's part of another technology solution. That can be a static website (JAMstack), or a SaaS service or what have you.But do we as the producer hand over the codebase and the AWS console? Like once we have the restapi set up and the endpoints do what they are supposed to — what exactly do they get at the end of it all? I’m confused by this whole agreement between the company/devs producing the code and the end customer that receives the deliverables.It depends on the agreements you had with your client beforehand.

It is up to you to either train them on the access and maintence or you can just say fuckit heres the code and leave them sitting in the dust if you really dont care about your rep and or company.So if I understand this they basically lend you their AWS account?

How important is software coding / computer sci in mechanical engineering roles?,"You can spend your entire career with no knowledge of coding.

The stack is for a bunch of parts of different materials and the conductivity of each varies significantly with temperature. I’m pretty good with Excel but I’m confident if I could code better I’d be able to write a script that significantly cuts my Excel time down. I really wish I took another programming class in college, it’s not something I’d use often but every once in awhile you’ll find a situation like this where those skills would help save a lot of time.I used matlab in uni, but have zero knowledge of it now. How or where would you suggest someone with zero knowledge build up some understanding of eg. Python? Will be looking to learn skills in my own time out of work.I'm a design engineer and write a grand total of zero lines of code each week. I enjoy matlab and have dabbled in Python but neither are required in my day-to-day.",5,255,0.019607843,0.019607843,1,255,40.88,4.77,83.69,69.58,21.25,16.47,90.2,71.76,58.82,14.51,9.8,7.06,0,2.35,0,0.39,4.71,15.29,4.71,1.96,15.29,10.98,7.06,5.1,1.96,19.22,4.71,7.84,4.71,0.39,3.92,0.39,21.18,2.35,18.82,3.92,1.96,3.53,3.14,1.57,5.88,0,3.92,3.53,0.39,0.78,0.78,0,0,0,0,0,5.88,2.75,0.39,0,0.39,0,1.57,3.14,0,0,0,0,0.39,0,0,0.39,9.41,0,0,9.02,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.78,0.39,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,0.78,8.24,7.45,0,0.78,5.88,0.39,0,0,3.53,4.71,5.88,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,12.55,5.88,1.18,0.39,0,3.92,1.18,
How to Actually Reduce Software Defects,"I mean, did they even try turning it off and on again?If only this were universally true.  I've experienced organizations that create incentives for developers to spit out defective code, by a combination of:Excellent quote.To write low defects code, you need to narrow the gap between what the code actually does and what you think the code does. Use robust logic to leave no case unhandled and do lots of reality checks: unit testing, regression testing, performance testing, dev testing, continuous integration, QA testing, etc...We're in a massive sellers' market for development labor right now. Probably more robust than even during the dotcom bubble. If a developer doesn't like their job, there are a great many people willing to offer them more money to try another one and see if it's better.Yet another article that thinks developers all love their jobs all the time.Generally speaking, taking care of all of the edges cases in your low level code results in a dramatic decrease in the time it takes to write the high level code.The author seems to be saying if you don't aim for 100% bug free code then your team suddenly becomes lazy. Why is knowing your level of tolerance for bugs mutually exclusive from delivering high quality code?No, I think he's reformulating the notion that defect leakage through different development phases should be minimized, with the end goal of catching them all before they hit production.I'm inclined to agree with you but the author stresses that anything less than hyperbole fails to get the message across that bugs aren't ""a fact of life"", and shouldn't be tolerated.I agree that the article is bad, because it offers no solutions. However, I don't think that zero defects is unrealistic. It all comes down to code quality. If all the code can be easily understood and there are no places that feel like they might hide a bug, there will be no defects that are not immediately found out. If some piece of code can behave wrong (for example a binary search), it should be automatically tested.Author specifically speaks out against unit tests. Well not against them, but about their insufficiency. Developers have this weird idea that unit testing is all that's needed, and managers don't know what it is between different kinds of tests. Heck, developers, tooIt's a very bad article.I submit you may have missed the point.This is a bad article.Not usually, no. It's why all tasks are prioritized. We've put it to clients that we can either fix a lot of low-priority bugs or work on features and they want features because features make money. Such is life.From a business perspective, is it actually cost effective to shoot for not having any trash on the floor for your customers and employees to trip over?NASA also still uses hardware developed in the 1980s.  It's a tradeoff.  I'm working on a flight test with NASA.  The requirements to prove that our stuff won't damage the aircraft are far more severe then we've dealt with in the past.  It makes sense though.  I write custom software and make pretty pictures of hardware that gets built, but very rarely do I even see it outside of CAD or an analysis model.From a business perspective, is it actually cost effective to shoot for a 0 defect rate? How about 100% uptime?To some degree this is why some developers advocate writing the tests first and then implementing the feature. If the tests are written on how it should work you can see your progress as you implement things.Yeah, I think it's important to understand that nuance.I agree with the ""tight feedback loop."" I've long held that short cycle time (aka time-to-fix, not counting fixes that turn out not to be fixes) is a good metric.This is the heart of the article. The truest definition of a ""bug"" is when expectations differ from reality.Yup.  The single greatest tool I have for reducing defects is time.  My best programming years were spent in a situation where I could effectively set my own schedule.  This allowed me to finish all implementation, take a weekend or more off, then come back with a (somewhat) refreshed view on things.  Then, simply by reviewing all of the code I had touched, paying attention to whether the comments are correct, doing minor cleanup, etc., would reveal most of the bugs for that release cycle.Hell, the internal project I worked on for a previous employer had lots of technical debt when I joined it.  Once the original lead developer left, we weren't allowed to rewrite it using libraries that would reduce said debt and its associated maintenance costs.If you don't have time to do it right, you certainly don't have time to do it wrong.You're absolutely right, projects that are always in hair on fire mode will almost always have high defect rates. But I will tell you that there are companies out there that understand this fact, and they don't allow themselves to get into the ""everything needs to be delivered yesterday"" state of mind. If you're looking for an environment like that, find a company that's developer-centric. The best indicator is if the CEO has software experience, or if the company makes a product that is for developers. I've worked with a wide variety of clients where my job has been to advise them on how to build higher quality software in a consistent way and break out of the panic mode environment, and those two types of companies have always absorbed the message better than the others.It is a lone unicorn but I have had exactly one such project. Scope was set before we estimated and was not allowed to move. Budget was set after we had made a deep estimation process. People for the project were locked in for the entire period and Quality was therefore in our hands. It took work of course, but we delivered coming in under our estimation (we were 4% off). We had 100% function and 93% branch coverage in our unit tests and the UI was fully Squish tested. We delivered more features than originally planned and now 3 years out they have only had to do new versions to deliver more features or fix a hardware issue. The process from that project became the template by which all other projects at the place is now run. I left as the project finished because I got an offer with a 10 minute walking commute for equivalent pay, but I miss working under those conditions even though I expect it was the single project where everything magically came together and I will never see it again.As long as we always have to deliver yesterday because sales over promised, I don't see how we can have time to properly think over an implementation and produce 0 defects.I can't agree enough with this.  I've seriously had situations where I am given 1 day to do 5 days worth of work with a word-of-mouth spec, no testing environment, and no sample data to run until the day it needs to be finished, then had the client get upset that it wasn't working immediately in production.I've delivered multiple zero-defect projects. We've done it for clients with whom we have a lot of trust and can really sell them on a quality-first approach.Sometimes software is built to spec, but the spec was not what was really needed or wanted. Whether you treat that as a bug or a change request is kinda academic because you have to fix it.",3,1292,0.002321981,0.002321981,1,1291,44.35,28.94,61.66,27.4,28.69,20.06,87.37,70.64,56.93,13.25,6.97,2.71,1.47,1.47,0.08,1.16,6.27,15.18,7.05,1.55,12.86,10.77,5.5,6.43,2.4,18.59,5.65,5.65,4.96,1.78,2.48,0.77,16.27,2.09,14.18,2.63,2.17,1.86,2.71,1.24,4.88,0,2.48,1.47,0.93,0.7,0.23,0.46,0.15,0,0.08,0.08,8.13,2.71,0.23,0.08,0,0.23,1.01,5.11,0,0,0,0.08,0.77,0.08,0,0.7,7.59,0.08,0,6.35,1.39,0.08,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.93,0.15,1.32,0.31,0.15,0,0.15,0.08,0.54,6.89,8.37,0.39,1.39,5.73,0.77,0.08,0.39,4.34,4.73,6.27,1.08,0.77,0.31,0.54,0,0,15.03,5.58,3.87,0.39,0,2.79,2.4,

I am learning a software product along with a senior technical writer and on every meeting the senior writer asks questions in ways I've never imagined.,"Offer to be helpful in other ways to even up the situation? eg take notes... maybe?Yes. So you need to demonstrate your value in other ways. There’s enough work to go around. Distinguish yourself in note taking, or interviews or synthesizing / compiling the info, structuring the content, vocabulary / terminology, managing your workload / expectations…your problem is your insecurity.Corporate technical writing has always suffered from a lack of well-defined structure. If you look across the aisle to the Engineering side of a business you will find it is typically fairly well-managed by Senior Engineers who hold regular meetings and these leaders are paid to be managers with degrees in engineering. Today's technical writing teams are rarely organized in the same way. They are generally a cobbled-together, short-of-staff group with unclear leadership. Why is this? Traditionally, engineers have never respected the role of non-engineers to provide engineering documentation. On the face of it, this idea makes sense. How can someone with no degree in engineering possibly have the ability to write engineering documents? As all TWs know, engineers often struggle to explain their designs on paper. As an example, most engineering-based startups fail to hire TWs until they hit a brick wall (e.g., customers complain or a critical government review is rejected). At this point, a company will be FORCED to hire TWs for the first time. This should give you a very clear view of where you stand in your role as TW. You are a necessary evil in the eyes of most engineers and because of this, most other company employees. This thinking results in the hiring of a manager with no TW experience to manage TW teams instead of promoting TWs internally to leadership-paid positions. You, therefore, have a low-paid individual (Senior TWs) who is assigned to share all the critical tribal information with team members who may not see a Senior TW as a manager and may not be motivated to follow their direction. It's an organizational issue. Senior TWs are often difficult to work with because of this. In fact, most companies are afraid to fix the organizational structure of their TW departments because of its unpopularity and a continued belief that, at some point down the road, they can eliminate the TW role from their company - altogether. You will see this idea discussed openly when your company experiences a downturn resulting in layoffs. Often, Senior TWs are asked to onboard new TWs with no extra pay or benefit to them. On the Engineering side of the aisle, new hires are often mentored by paid managers (Senior Engineers) for up to 6 months before they are assigned to work independently. We need to help our employers see these organizational issues and understand the benefits of empowering TWs from within a team to manage that team. How does this relate to you as a new TW? This may explain why the Senior TW you work with acts the way she does. If she had been promoted to TW manager, she could mentor you privately and help get you on track without embarrassing you. Because the company has given her an artificial title, she has no real reason to help you succeed. Her only motivation is to keep the team functioning just enough to allow her to deliver her own work on time and accurately. It truly is the assigned manager's job to train you. However, these managers rarely have the insight to do so because they are hired from outside.This is a matter of self-perception. Maybe the company has a different process for documenting software than the one you're used to. If you're still being trained as a new hire, then the team won't expect you to perform on the same level.One thing that helps me is to think of our customer support reps. I’ve worked as IT support and as a CS rep, so I try to anticipate the questions they’d get.Are you writing in a language other than English?When working with someone you feel is better at the job than you are, the best thing you can do is learn from them and talk with them more. You probably have some strengths or ideas she doesn't have and if you approach this situation as you and her are part of a team, you'll likely go far.Ask if you can take her review of your work offline and go over it in a 1:1 session instead.Just write down the answers and practice active listening. No one is expecting you to perform like a senior writerIf you cannot depend on your TWs to independently interview SMEs, once the onboarding period is complete, you are not training them properly. The SME must be responsible for reviewing a TWs work through the development part of the process. You, as the manager, should only see the document as the very last reviewer.  At that point, you should still find a few issues, but very few.It depends based on your company and your team. If it is anything like mine, it won't affect your evaluation.More context would be helpful here - can you give some examples?As you gain experience, you will be better able to anticipate issues and to know what you need to get your work done, so you'll have a better idea of what questions to ask. Nobody is expecting you to have the depth and breadth of knowledge that your senior coworker does. You'll get there.It sounds like you are in an excellent position to learn from a pro. Instead of nursing your insecurities, learn.The TW must build a relationship with the SME so they can work independently. Micromanaging the data collection process is counterproductive. It is always to the benefit of the TW to learn to ask the correct questions on their own (once onboarding is complete). Complex, technical projects may take a series of interviews by the TW with the SME. If something gets missed, there should never be a situation where a TW cannot contact the SME independently. A TW may want to sit in on weekly Engineering meetings for a project and be allowed to ask questions as the project evolves. If a TW cannot successfully interview the SME by themselves something is wrong. Keep in mind, Senior TWs and managers should ONLY review the final document. The questions a TW may have missed can be addressed at this time and all at once. The TW should own the collection process and be seen as the only point of contact for Engineering to work with on this project. This avoids the collection of misinformation from multiple contacts.Most TWs avoid interviewing SMEs with others present because it interferes with their learning process and motivation to learn to ask the right questions on their own.Roger that. Yes she's experienced and twice my age. I try to make notes most of the time.Technical writers are “less good at feelings” lol, seconded 😂It sounds like you are in an excellent position to learn from a pro. Instead of nursing your insecurities, learn.We've been learning new software to create release notes and stuff.

I wished non-technically gifted authors writing near modern day sci fi stories would stop trying to explain technology to us,"It’s always been the same with the latest cool science word. In the 40s/50s, everything was “atomic”.To add to this, they always seem to throw the word ""quantum"" a lot when explaining some far-fetched technology. Whether it is to explain time travel, dimensions, multivererses, fast travel, or whatever it is you can think of, its always quantum something. Just tell me that the machine lets you do that and thats it, I only care about what it does and its consequences, not the how.It hasn't happened in years that I haven't grasped a sci-fi concept from the jump.  Because, really, this stuff isn't that hard.  I've read the blurbs for that and my brain is all twisted up.  I really want to read it for the challenge of grasping it. I showed somebody the blurb and I believe my glee at the word soup involved has him thinking I'm a much bigger nerd than before.  Which.... I mean he should have known.Ah yes, Greg ""I'm going to turn my hobby of reading scientific papers into a writing career"" Egan.And then on the other end of the spectrum you have Greg Egan getting a couple of alternate-universe PhDs and writing multi-year research theses for A Clockwork Rocket. Excellent series of books if you like hard SF, by the way, but kinda crunchy on the physics side.I feel like I remember seeing a quote from Carl Sagan once, about how he was discussing a particular work of fiction with a friend, and they both realized that they'd thought the science in the show was accurate except for their own, personal, different areas of particular expertise.As a server/bartender in upscale places for 20 years….the amount of wrongness with all things alcohol is staggering to behold. My husband never notices, but I get so riled up. Last one was a vodka martini (I guess?), poured straight from the bottle into a martini glass, dropped a cherry in it and started drinking. 2nd worst is when people are carrying cups of coffee but there’s clearly no liquid in the cup. Like what a dumb detail, why would you leave the cup empty so the actor has to act more?""Oh right, this is infotainment.. not news"" (no hate for John, love his show) I can't watch or read nearly any medical stuff in any media as its almost always garbage or males no sense.   Especially in old war movies or hospital scenes, everyone is just doing random nonsense to look busy.It's like watching John Oliver when he speaks on a topic you are actually knowledgeable about.Sadly the thing I know about is politics, governance and negotiation! So much fantasy drives me nuts. There’s a book I’m now thinking I just will not read because the protagonist is an ambassador. I’ve tried that game before and it was awful.Speaking of, as a psa to anyone writing stories based in Japan (especially historical Japan), do not go into detail on the kimono without understanding it. There is a tight knit kimono community and we will laugh at your mistakes. This goes double for kimono sexy times—we love roasting that!I am an avid follower of Space and Rocketry technology I can hardly read or watch ANY books/shows/movies that include Spaceflight because they get every single fundemental thing wrong. Orbits are just ignored, re-entry to the surface is just straight down at 200g's, rockets just going straight up and then they're suddenly in ""orbit"" without coming straight down again. I wish I could return to being blissfully ignorant about every single topic so I could just enjoy something without cringing so hard. Sci-fi is the absolute worst because its 99% writers with effectively no interest in the actual Sci part but having the constraints of a grounded reality of an ""old timey"" or modern world denies them from writing their weird self insert power fantasyAs someone who has no clue how drumming works, I enjoy the videos where an actual drummer analyzes what someone is doing in a movie or cartoon and then plays what the music would actually sound like based on the characters drumming.There's a term for this which I can't quite remember in terms of newspapers. Basically 'if whenever you read a news article about something you're v familiar with it gets stuff majorly wrong why do you trust that paper on anything else'?When you are an expert at something, seeing it described in books or movies is painful more often than not. Which should inform your skepticism of explanations of things where you are not an expert.This is extra frustrating because there are legit ways to make fires with minimal/no visible smoke that you could find with like 5 seconds of googling.I guess that author never read My Side of the Mountain when they were younger. The scene where Sam nearly kills himself because he’s made his shelter too airtight is burned in my brain foreverI know a lot of smaller/indie authors browse book subs so i'm not gonna name names and hurt feelings but damn... I enjoy casual fluff sci-fi especially post-apocalyptic stuff and there's this one series where I couldn't get over how the main character always built camp fires inside abandoned buildings and basements and the author specifically pointed out that every window/door/hole was closed up as to not to alert anyone with the smoke. Basically the would have died of CO poisoning in the first 20 pages.If there is a steam engine, it must be steam engine timeOne of my favourite scenes from one of my favourite fanworks, Second Empire. A ship full of renegade Daleks has just given pursuing Imperial Daleks the slip by hiding inside a nebula called the Shoal Zone, and the helmsdalek orders shipwide ""silent running"" to avoid generating any noise that would give them away. I have used that quote whenever confronted with technobabble or other such ""reasoning"" ever since then. Ah. I see. Quantum. Naturally, a clumsy Dalek eventually winds up bumping a table and knocking a wrench off of it, which clangs to the floor and the chase resumes.The spirit of Granny Weatherwax and time travelling monks is strong in this thread: Granny Weatherwax wouldn’t know what a pattern of quantum inevitability was if she found it eating her dinner. If you mentioned the words ‘paradigm of space-time’ to her she’d just say ‘What?’ But that didn’t mean she was ignorant. It just meant that she didn’t have truck with words, especially gibberish. ‘And then there’s quantum, of course.’  The monk sighed.  ‘There’s always bloody quantum.’ I love how Terry Pratchett lamp shaded QuantumMost people don't know how they work even today.Reminds me of a Wait But Why post about AI. Theoretically, if you go back far enough, and brought them to your era, they may die of shock at the advancements, but for someone in the 1800s to get that same result, they'd have to go back further than you did and so on so forthSuper pedantic I know, but just clarifying that the scene you're describing didn't involve a character from the 1800s.  Characters in the ""His Dark Materials"" series didn't time travel, they moved between alternate universes. Lyra's world was one that developed differently from the world where she encountered the computer.  One example of this is that not only does Lyra's world have zeppelins, but also gyrocopters, which make a chopping noise, leading us to believe they are similar to helicopters in our world.I just finished Terra Ignota series by Ada Palmer, and I actually loved how technology was addressed in that book. The series is set 400 years in the future, and while there are big sci-fi technologies the author makes a conscious point of not explaining how anything work but just letting you know that its taken engineers 100-200 years to perfect the technology. No unnecessary details, just being told ""this was very fucking hard, but we eventually solved it"" Spoiler: The series also decide that magic is real pretty quickly and knows you will find the magic in the series unreasonable. It tells you to your face that nothing makes sense but its what it is.I play a minor CIO role in my small company (not my primary job) and whenever I try to learn something new that's a bit more advanced I have to wade  through dozens of videos explaining how things are designed to work rather than how to use it.  Sometimes I scrub through a video that's 20 minutes long and never actually see the product being explained.Took me a sec, you're talking about Lyra seing the doctor in Will's Oxford. Slight tangent, Lyra's world has roughly the tech level of 1800s but there's a lot of random more modern stuff like electricity (Anbaricity) and airships. The reason why technology is antiquated is because the magisterium stifles innovation Edit: Lyra's world had computers, called ordinators, according to the wiki. Haven't checked the chapter it references.
Edit 2: amber -> Anbaricity.
Edit 3: also electric cars and electromechanical dronesWe can see with modern tech. People don’t generally care how a smartphone works, they just care about what it can doThere’s a bit in The Subtle Knife where a character from the 1800s encounters a computer. The doctor using the computer wants to explain how it works, but the 1800s person is totally uninterested and just wants to know what it can do, not how. I always thought that was a great way of writing that, and how people would most likely behave. EDIT: strangely, the character Lyra in The Subtle Knife isn’t from the 1800s, she’s from a different version of our time (circa 2000 when the book was published) where technology has advanced slowly.",18,1647,0.010928962,0.010928962,1,1649,38.43,22.83,73.55,16.76,27.48,19.22,87.08,71.32,56.09,14.07,7.28,3.27,0.42,1.46,1.03,1.03,6.79,14.61,7.76,1.94,11.7,8.61,8.31,6.61,2.3,17.34,6.19,3.94,2.55,0.73,1.15,0.91,17.4,1.7,15.65,4.12,2.49,1.58,3.15,0.91,4.85,0.18,3.58,1.58,1.88,1.15,0.49,0.67,0,0.18,0.06,0.18,9.34,3.88,0.24,0,0.06,0.42,2.06,5.46,0.18,0,0.61,0.67,1.64,0.24,0,1.39,3.52,0.79,0.12,2.49,0,0.12,1.58,0.42,0.12,0,0,0.24,0.06,0.61,0.18,0.36,0.24,0.49,0.3,0.18,0.06,0,0.3,0.36,4.97,10.07,0.61,1.76,6,0.97,0.36,0.85,4.18,3.46,5.82,1.21,0.49,0.24,0.06,0.18,0,16.43,5.09,3.82,0.24,0.12,3.27,3.88,
I'll never understand why people get such a huge hardon for technology that's been completely obsolete since the mid 60s.,"The UK is similar but we keep paying a lot to use them.They have been trying to build a new one for 10 years in California. They can't make them even if they want to lol.they've only experienced american trains....thats why.North America, yes. Well I actually can't speak for Mexico but Canada's rail system is crap.New Zealand has entered the chat.Only in America trains are 60s-level obsolete LULBullet trains are amazing for example Great Western Railway uses them and I was on one for a journey between London and Cardiff, it was smooth, fast, way easier and quicker than driving, and had very reasonably priced alcohol on board…Don’t think I’ve ever disagreed with a title so much. The UK’s rail network is terrible but when I’ve worked abroad it has been brilliant.Ugh. I promise, there are many of us who wish our rail system was much better and served more people. I'd love a train trip to many of the places I go for work instead of driving so dang much.It's why my family took a multi State road trip each summer when I was growing up. Sure, we could've flown to each major destination we hit in New England, the Great Plains/Grand Canyon/Yellowstone; or the Southwestern States...for a lot of money, even in the 60s and 70s, when we took those vacations. But we would've missed a lot... And we'd have as little appreciation for the sheer natural beauty of this country as many younger Americans seem to!I don’t even think they realize how far our railway technology is behind. I’ve lived in big cities my whole life and even live right along one of the longest train routes in the country and I just saw a passenger train for the maybe they 3rd time in my life just last weekend. They make it so painful to take a train here (same price as an airline ticket and takes 3x longer than a car ride would most of the time) so it just never makes sense to take one even though I’ve always wanted to. And that’s by design. Some people enjoy the scenery when they travel.It's not a bug, it's a feature. A feature of capitalism where public transport is made obsolete so they can sell more cars and plane tickets.Conclusion: We've developed past the need for a USATell me about it. The Netherlands have a pretty dense railroad network. When in Uni I travelled all over the country with my free student card.Just because Railway technology has left the USA FAR behind does not make it obsolete! ""You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means!""Although it makes complete sense a direct London->Paris line just seems so otherworldlyI wish I could do this. But as a swede we have way too long travel time and it's also way more expensive to go by train so it's not an option. Even domestic flights are cheaper than going by train so the only time I use train is if I'm going to a smaller city without sny airportExactly. Glasgow to London is an hour by plane and four-ish hours by train. I will always take the train. It’s a much easier way to travel, I’m city centre to city centre and I only have to take my belt off in the train if I get really lucky.In my area, trains are electric. Not sure I can say the same about planes!Eurostar is great tbfYeah, but if it's in the city center where are you supposed to park your car so you can drive yourself back out to the suburbs?And the fact you can't haul thousands of tons of material across a country in a plane. People who make comments like this are just so desperately unaware of how the world truly operates. They're the kinds of people who just say 'automate it' at every problem, and then fail to consider or elaborate further.",7,682,0.01026393,0.01026393,1,682,34.41,24.4,83.38,59.31,27.28,15.1,86.51,73.46,56.45,12.9,9.24,4.25,1.61,1.03,0,1.91,3.67,13.64,7.48,1.91,11.88,9.82,8.65,8.21,1.61,18.91,9.09,5.72,2.93,1.76,0.73,0.44,14.81,1.32,13.2,2.79,2.49,2.93,1.76,0.59,4.55,0,4.25,3.23,0.73,0.88,0.44,0.44,0,0,0,0.29,8.06,1.32,0.15,0,0.15,0,0.73,5.13,0,0,0,0,1.61,0.44,0.15,1.03,1.91,0.29,0,0.59,1.03,0,0.73,0.29,0.15,0,0,0.15,0,0.15,0,0.59,0.88,1.17,0,0.15,0,0,0.29,0,8.94,12.17,0.15,2.2,9.38,0.15,0,0.59,3.23,4.25,7.04,1.47,0.44,0.15,0.15,0.15,0,15.84,6.6,2.35,0.15,0.59,4.4,1.76,
I've been out of the loop on commercial Unix for a decade. What are some features you love about Unix software and hardware that you don't see anywhere else?,"We don't pay for that anymoreYou mean like RHEL, SuSE, Oracle Linux, and Canonical license?What happened to that HP-UX? And HP in general, they backed up from servers. Pitty they are now selling only printers and laptops.The company I work for has recently spent several months doing field research on solaris-based illumos OS, like SmartOS and OmniOS, and, as far as it is our current understanding, there is nothing of similar robustness, flexibility and potentiality outside real Unix, not even BSDs. Based on some niche criteria, I am sure other sysadmins may say otherwise, but for now, to us, illumos-based OS are still head and shoulder above the rest.There is such feature - grep from AIX does have -p option (paragraph) - description from man grep on AIX:-p[Separator] Displays the entire paragraph containing matched lines.
              Paragraphs are delimited by paragraph separators, as
              specified by the Separator parameter, which are patterns
              in the same form as the search pattern. Lines containing
              the paragraph separators are used only as separators;
              they are never included in the output. The default
              paragraph separator is a blank line.
The 'ideas' of NIM from AIX world and IgniteUX from HP-UX world are also nice.Also the PowerVM from AIX world has great capabilities when it comes to virtualization features.Since no one had mentioned it yet, MacOS is still in heavy development and certified UNIX.I also think that the take off of amd64 and CISC against MIPS, SPARC, PowerPC, VAX, Alpha -and Itanium obviously- contributed throwing IRIX, Solaris, OS X, Ultrix, OpenVMS, True64 and HP-UX respectively out of the market.Yet, let's not forget that the current top 3 supercomputers all run RHEL on IBM POWER9""Commercial"" (i.e., proprietary) Unix operating systems were killed off by a few major factors:the dominance of Microsoft Windows in the 1990sthe popping of the dot-com bubblesticking with their own processors (MIPS, SPARC) as Intel's x86 took over the worldopen-source Unix/Unix-like operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, MINIX) and their larger/more responsive development communitiesThere are still a few proprietary/closed-source Unix(-like) operating systems, but they're almost always vertically integrated with the vendor's hardware, either as a niche player (macOS/iOS running on Apple hardware, QNX running on BlackBerry) or as enterprise-class ""big iron"" (AIX running on IBM hardware, HP-UX running on HP hardware).GNU/Linux has been adopted by commercial entities and now dominates the server market, with the greatest growth in the domain of virtual servers.  Commercial UNIX products based on GNU/Linux is the path forward over proprietary UNIX implementations.The exception of course is macOS.  Although it is typically not deployed in a server setting, macOS is a POSIX compliant UNIX.  In addition to providing compatibility with the past, it continues to evolve, adding state-of-the-art next-generation features.  For example, macOS supports integrated file system encryption; integrated, incremental, encrypted full-disk backup (using UNIX filesystem hard links); and a modern filesystem (AppleFS) that has leapfrogged most other commercial/open-source offerings.Commercial UNIX is all but dead, and no longer getting new features.Solaris is still being supported by Oracle, but no longer developed.AIX is still being supported and, to an extent, developed by IBM, but a minor release hasn't come along in about three years, and a major release hasn't come along in about ten.Unfortunately Unix vendors don't seem to actually tout their features too much nowadays.That's because they, for all intents and purposes, no longer exist. The torch has passed to the open-source efforts around Linux and FreeBSD.Can you give some insights as to what about illumos-based OS' are keeping you away from the BSDs and Linux variants?",23,594,0.038720539,0.038720539,1,611,77.23,17.95,52.72,29.01,47,28.64,70.21,57.61,45.99,5.24,2.78,0.49,0.65,0.33,0,1.31,2.45,11.46,6.22,1.31,14.24,7.2,5.24,7.36,2.13,12.11,7.53,4.09,2.13,0.65,0.65,0.82,12.27,1.8,10.47,0.98,1.47,0.49,1.31,0.82,5.24,0.16,1.96,1.31,0.65,0.16,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,4.26,1.64,0.49,0,0.16,0,0.49,2.45,0,0,0,0.16,1.31,0,0,1.31,3.6,0,0.16,1.8,1.64,0,1.15,0.49,0.16,0.33,0,0,0,0,0.33,0,0,0.49,0.16,0,0,0,0,0.16,4.26,9.49,0.16,1.47,7.69,0.33,0,0.33,3.11,1.96,7.69,0.16,0.33,0.33,0,0,0,25.04,4.42,8.35,0.49,0,1.96,9.82,
IOS Software Update,"particular to apple products and most are backward compatible to some extent. II have used mostly IOS phones although I did a small trip with pixel phones too.

I have been using apple phone since around 2007 with no problem whatsoever. I know personally, I want their watch development to move faster so we could use an apple watch for our children since most should not have full phones at the age that they are now. I wish the apple watch to be  a receiver like pumps and iPhones areIt worked fine on all the 15.2 betas and now the release version.

The note8 has 6gb of ram and I use it daily since a week before it launched and there is absolutely zero slowdown or lag. The phone is an absolute powerhouse. OP was talking about the S9.

Apple hasn't innovated in years and while Samsung was a bit behind in certain respects, they are pushing ahead and leading innovative features and I believe that the consumer market perception of Apple is going to start to quickly catch on to this. Apple cut production numbers for the iPhone X because it wasn't selling like they anticipated. The iPhone 8 offers little improvement over the 7. It will be interesting to see what Apple will be doing next cycle because lately, it honestly hasn't been impressive. Is the iPhone a good smartphone. No doubt. But it is quickly becoming an overpriced device in a market where consumers can find powerful smartphones in terms of hardware for a fraction of the price apple is charging. They aren't going away but I do suspect their market share will continue to decline unless they start innovating new features and functionality. This, of course, is just my perspective.I had some lag issues on beta 2 I believe. Have they been fixed? my experience is very different. ipad pro 2015 ipad pro 2017 samsung galaxy tab  s2 samsung galaxy tab s3 samsung galaxy s8+ samsung galaxy note 8 lg v20S9+ is slightly faster because of the new processor, but iOS 11 is a mess in terms of speed. I’m running the beta for 12 currently, and it’s so much better on the X. Give it some timeI also own both phone’s.

IT equipment purchases for remote new hires: Is there an advantage to giving the new hire an allowance to buy whatever they need vs buying the IT equipment?,"noone is out of the country, the hassle to return equipment from out of states is crazy illogical anyway.If they’re out of country you should let them purchase within their own country.I have a standard order with my hardware vendor for dock, monitors, kb/m, headsets that is shipped directly to new hires.  No stock needed, no extra shipping costs and standardized so easy for Helpdesk support.we want to avoid keeping small stock. Our company is fully remote and keeping small stock means constantly having to ship from an office which costs money shipping wise rather than free shipping from a vendor.For me buy it in bulk for the discount and you will have a fix/solution that will work on all your hiresUnless you have an ironclad agreement that you're not gonna support what they buy, you don't want them buying all sorts of random stuff.Always buy what you can support. if you give end users allowance, they will buy whatever they want and if it breaks, it is your problem to fix it. So be careful what you wish for.we want to avoid keeping small stock. Our company is fully remote and keeping small stock means constantly having to ship from an office which costs money shipping wise rather than free shipping from a vendor.If it's peripherals, give them an allowance. Most people will have an idea of what they want. For those that don't care, keep a small stock of devices you can send to them.we definitely will provide laptops.Depends on what they're buying.

"Idea: automated checkout software accessible to everyone, to combat scalpers on high-interest items like the PS5.","Good advice all around, thanks!You're right about the availability information - the more I thought about the scaling of the software, I realized there's no point for all of the clients/agents to constantly crawl pages - that can be centralized, preferably in servers close to the target sites, and updates can be pushed to clients.Then there's the issue of not becoming another army of bots - enforcing limits on purchases per person or address, maybe even creating a sort of a queue controlled from a server that ensure agents make requests in an orderly fashion. If I can find ways to provide value to both sides(shoppers and stores) then that would indeed differentiate the service.This is how I would evolve the business:- make a platform that crawls e-commerce sites and provides quick updates to any users with a paid subscription- make an agent that handles purchases locally, can use the previous service, and somehow enforces the purchase limits & coordination with other agents(through another server)- eventually make a delegate purchasing service that handles the whole purchase on the server side; who knows, if done well, it could become the place to do in-demand launches for e-commerce sites, reducing their IT & infrastructure costsI agree with what you said about branding, it'll help the platform stand out - I'm not trying to make another bot that just contributes to the problem, I'm trying to give everyone a fair chance at getting what they want.I saw your reply to my comment on the other thread.I don’t think it would be profitable to make just the software. It would become pure maintenance and support cost for very little margin. I think you need to make a service of it (as I mentioned in the other post).Run your crawlers to provide availability information by product and site/service. Do as a subscription. Make the agent just to consume the service alerts and attempt the purchase.You know this whole thing kinda reminds me of high frequency trading. This is like high frequency commerce. Become the information broker.Anyway, I would say concentrate on your branding. Don’t become just another bot to be countered. Be the human face of this, trying to help people get what they want fairly (your project pages do state that to some extent). I remember what someone said about wanting to het a PS5 for someone who had lost their family to COVID and was in a dark place (not sure I’m remembering that correctly).But for any one these services/products to work you’ll need critical mass and recognition and showing that your way is all around better for the ‘fair play’ shoppers. Show the e-commerce sites that that is what you are trying to do. Are you arming just another set of bots or are you smartly managing the crawlers, finding ways to verify shoppers?If you are going commercial, what’s the vision? e.g. becoming a bona fide delegate purchasing service (that would take a lot of legal work, but offers a good value, no?)Yeah, I'm sure it can be useful for limited launches, where scalpers focus their efforts. Just wondering if I can reach enough customers per launch to get enough revenue in. I guess I need to follow the scalpers to see where the high-interest items are and that's how I'll find out who I need to market to - the customers trying to buy from those shops.Until your bot’s user agent gets banned.Added link to my project at the end of the post.I guarantee people are going to pay $20 to get the item they want at launch. Obviously some pay hundreds of dollars or scalpers wouldn't exist. So if you were able to create a software you can charge even just $20 per successful sale, you'd likely be rolling in the dough before retailers realize something has to be changed if people have to buy via a third party bot.",3,655,0.004580153,0.004580153,1,662,64.58,46.31,23.83,55.5,36.78,21,88.52,69.79,53.93,14.05,7.55,3.47,0,2.72,0,0.91,6.5,16.47,8.01,0.91,13.9,8.76,5.14,4.38,1.21,19.79,4.38,4.53,3.63,0.45,1.96,1.21,17.98,0.91,17.07,3.47,1.96,4.38,3.93,0.91,3.47,0.45,2.57,2.42,0.15,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,0,9.67,3.17,0.91,0.3,0,0.15,1.21,6.5,0,0,0,0,1.36,0.15,0,1.21,8.61,0.45,0,4.98,4.38,0,0.3,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.06,0.6,1.96,0,0.3,0,0.3,0.15,0.45,6.65,8.01,0.6,1.66,4.68,0.91,0,0,1.81,2.42,5.44,1.81,1.21,0.91,0.3,0,0,16.31,4.53,3.17,0.45,0.15,2.72,5.29,

"If Microsoft can't make a universal dark mode and consistent UI in Windows according to other members ""It would break compatibility with 32-bit software from the 1990s"" Why don't Microsoft copy Redhat's solution?","They could also just retheme the old theme and remove white borders and change fontthey can, when win32 was ruling we had built in theming (or should I say coloring?) that worked like a charm, they just removed it at some pointSource pleaseA system-wide dark mode is coming in the next update on fall 2022.MS will start testing it with insiders later this year on dev branch.Yeah, no. That's not how operating systems work.What people mean by the ""old legacy 32bit UI"" is called Windows Controls, still used by a shitload of software, and integrated into the standard WinAPI window creation system which everyone uses. This does not compare to 32bit vs 64bit in an open source world where the software can simply be recompiled unless it uses stuff like casting to int for pointers (which you should never do by the way). Also, the WOW64 subsystem doesn't have to be installed on Windows Server, so the support is already separate (that's what NT subsystems are for after all), it's just shipped by default.MS gains nothing from breaking backwards compatibility in such a nuclear way, except breaking more software - there's a reason Compatibility Mode exists, and it isn't because every single software from XP still works. MS gains nothing from throwing out the UI framework which might very well be the most widespread one - all this fancy XAML stuff just started with Windows 8 and most apps I see still use Windows Forms / Windows Controls.Also, even the Linux kernel doesn't break compatibility with userspace.That being said...I don't get why they can't retheme the controls, as their colors can already be set.I think it's time to do at massive debloat of old legacy stuffs,they should remove everything up to windows 7, having this backward compatibility it's just useless,you aren't buying windows 11 to run windows XP stuffs,use a vm if really required. Running an old os is not even a fraction of running a modern program like office and other. Even Linux is ditching 32-bit support on most clean install distro,in fact you need to install the support separatelyCouldnt have said it betterYeah I agree. If you’re still using some 90s relic software for some obscure reason then either that should be updated to work or simply just don’t use win11. It’s amazing how they still support old software but time to let things die.Odd how MS has no issue with hardware obsolescence.F**k the compability who tf still use 90s old software they need to give consistent design if compability was an issue than they should have made windows 11 for older Intel and amd processorsIf not even Microsoft can bury their legacy components like Explorer, Task Manager, Device Manager, Control Panel, etc. Not mentioning regedit, Event Viewer, ...Because Win32 is a mature and working technology, while UWP/WinUI are still not mature enough and can require complex and hacky solutions for things that should work easily. And Win32 works flawlessly on Windows 7, which is still used by a significant amount of users.The problem is not in the idea itself, the problem is in those who execute it -the development team-Every time they have tried anything like that has failed. Their most recent attempt, Windows 10X, was canceled.this. why cant they start with core apps????make a dark notepad will have compatibility issues
- microsoft, 2021so make a  new fcking notepad with uwp/xmal/whateverKill win32 and you kill Windows as a platform.Simply too risky.Well, sorry but I'll quote answers from other places1st oneLight mode/dark mode are rendered through the Uxtheme engine reading thehex entries from the msstyles. I don't understand what comparabilityhas anything to do with this ? unless of course those relics from 1990'sare coded to read the hex from msstyle only in certain range which isnot possible.This excuse looks more like a cover for being lazy.""2nd one""
I am confused. Dark Mode has nothing to do with legacy technology. And
Windows does that. They did this with 16-bit support for its 32-bit OS. Now, we
kinda have this for running 32-bit programs under Windows 64-bit. WoW64 as it
is called. This can be removed from being installed. Not a user friendly
solution, but it can be done. But as the masses and most people on this forum
needs it, it won't come any time soon.
As for legacy frameworks and APIs, then sure that can be an option. Windows
10X (cancelled) offered something like this. The problem is that modern
programs are still using legacy stuff. And developers aren't interested in the
new stuff, mostly due to the lack of resources. The old stuff is all well
documented, fully featured with years upon years of improvements by Microsoft,
you have countless libraries and tools. All those don't work with the modern
technologies offered. 
 
""Problem is that ""Win32"" covers a huge chunk of modern 64-bit software and games as well, even though the name would indicate otherwise.Essentially everything that isn't UWP is based on older platforms (Win32/WinForms/WPF), so almost every user would have to install the legacy components to do most of the stuff on their computer anyway and it'd be back to square one. This is why the attempts on creating other versions like WinRT and 10X haven't been successful since they barely ran any desktop-class programs.Windows also has had a theme engine since Windows XP and this would be solvable by creating a new msstyle theme for it, a lot of programs would already respect it too but for some reason they're insisting on doing it per app basis. I don't know why but I guess there must be some reason why they are doing it this way instead.But the interface and the OS are together unlike Linux where they are separate.I hope they take enough time to release a real new OS and get all these things done with the successor of Windows 11.At least they're trying. Dark mode in Office sure helps my eyes at work. Now if they can tie that with Windows defaults, then we're good.this. knowing how much they love linux, it's safe to say that they may be on itAll they need is an api/intermediate layer between the app and the ui calls, to convert it to dark mode(edit: new ui elements). I'm pretty sure they were already working on this.Does the Dev version have a universal dark mode?Where did you read this?Or win32 apps (Like ones from the 1990s) could be run in a container, similar to WSL, which would enable Microsoft it get rid of all that legacy code bloating the OS while still maintaining compatibility.",29,1122,0.025846702,0.025846702,1,1132,36.24,20.14,21.54,53.04,30.59,19.61,83.66,66.08,54.77,11.93,4.42,1.15,0.27,0.62,0,2.21,7.51,13.07,5.74,3.62,11.57,11.66,6.45,5.92,2.56,17.93,6.01,3.53,3.71,0.62,2.03,1.06,16.78,1.5,15.28,1.94,3.53,2.92,2.21,0.88,5.04,0,3.36,2.65,0.53,0.62,0.53,0.09,0,0,0,0.18,6.63,2.92,1.06,0.35,0.09,0.27,0.8,4.15,0,0,0.35,0,1.77,0,0,1.77,4.59,0.09,1.77,2.65,0.09,0,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.71,0.09,0.62,0.27,0.27,0,0.27,0.18,0.53,6.45,5.57,0.18,0.88,3.53,1.24,0,0,4.15,2.56,6.8,0.88,0.71,0.53,0.27,0,0,16.87,5.57,3.98,0.71,0,2.65,3.98,

It is 2022: Not offering SSO on your software product at all subscription levels is borderline criminal,"Yup. That's the whole point. It centralizes onboarding, offboarding, password requirements, and mfa requirements.If you do it right, MFA is included in your identity provider.  So you set up MFA one time in your IDP and then every service that uses SSO with it is also protected.  I run into so many providers that support MFA, but only if you use their app or add it to the long list of authenticators in your generic app.  I mean, it's better that nothing, but definitely not ideal if you handle lots of different systems.  Synology only supports their app or a weird integration with another authenticator for example.  vCenter only officially supports ADFS (there are ways around it) is another one.I can’t wait until we are off Smartsheet. All anyone at my company uses it for is a glorified excel doc. They have MS365 which does the same thing.Out of curiosity is it only SAML you accept from your SaaS or would OpenID Connect/OAuth2 work too?It is part of our vendor onboarding process. SSO required for all SaaS solutions. Any SaaS solution that does not support SSO needs to be formally approved by the CISO and the C-Suite.You'd be surprised at the number of developers that not only require “local admin” user privileges for installation but for use as well.

JWTs in async calls?,"So a while back I had suggested that we do the same. However I chose to go with a much simpler version. In my events, I store headers that contain the meta info - userid, roles etc. That way downstream services can pick up an event and only check the headers.This is the correct approach. Not every service in your call stack needs to re-authenticate users. Internal service with no public facing API can and should rely on upstream to have Authenticated the customer. Coming to the internal call that B makes to A - this should be an internal API not a publicly exposed API. Also service A should be able to authenticate service B and service B should be authorised to call the particular API exposed by service A.After the consumer sends the message to service A, that user is authenticated. For further message processing you could use the user ID from the JWT. (From what you said, the message processing involves putting a record to kafka and then Service B consuming that record and calling Service A again)There are two scenarios where Service A ist used:What user action causes the Kafka message to be created?",3,202,0.014851485,0.014851485,1,200,78.84,31.66,22.74,20.23,20,24.5,78,59.5,51,9.5,4.5,2.5,0.5,1.5,0,0,5,19.5,12.5,0.5,10.5,9,3.5,5.5,1.5,14.5,4,1.5,1.5,0.5,1,0,11.5,1,10.5,1,2,4.5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4.5,0,0,0,0,4.5,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,6.5,1.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,3.5,9.5,0.5,3,7,0,0,0,2,2.5,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,5.5,2,0.5,0,0,3,

Keeping Rust (and other libre software) accessible to all,"I use it in the browser. If you need code help it's been great for me. The people monitoring it are super friendly and helpful.I'm not about to install discord just to keep up to date on Rust...People ARE updating IRC specification, at https://ircv3.net/. It's just that progress is slow.One question that I have been pretty stumpted about in the past few months is why have we stopped trying to improve open standards? IRC is a protocol defined, quite accessibly, by the IETF. If IRC is broken for your organization, why aren't we submitting updates to this specification to accommodate these problems?This is something I'm quite bent out of shape over. I just had a good discussion about it on said server. My end conclusion is, yeah, whatever, the WGs wanted to use Discord so that's what they're doing. It sucks, but as long as we can (at least try) to keep community spaces in free and open platforms, we will probably be OK.Speaking of: we have #rust:matrix.org for all you Matrix people!Interestingly, Spectrum chat is often overlooked when considering IRC alternatives. It's also open source, and I just created a room to give it a try: https://spectrum.chat/gfxIf it's not IRC (or something like IRC) I can't use it.Does Zulip work? It's open, but the primary client is web based. We have a server on http://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/ used by some teams.I've been eyeing Matrix as well, they're improving on their moderation documentation but there are some other concerns about capacity (maybe? I've seen various concerns crop up over time, I haven't myself encountered this one)The primary driver behind the decisions to switch to Discord and Zulip was not ""prettier and cutesy emoji"". IRC has proven very hard to moderate, and it's become an inclusion problem to keep running official things there. Plus, the lack of persistence (both scrollback-wise and the fact that there is no easy standard way to log out and still be pingable)  becomes a problem for being able to get anything done in a distributed org. Last year individual teams experimented with a bunch of platforms and ended up mostly on Discord and Zulip, which are both easier to use and easier to moderate.That said, I recognize that in this process we have made it harder for folks who use screen readers. I'm hoping to eventually get us onto something that works for everyone (This might still be Discord, if they make their app work better on screen readers or start allowing third party clients). If you know of any specific non-IRC systems that are good with screen readers (and have persistence), let me know!Could you explain a little bit about why you choose to use exclusively libre software/protocols? When you say that you are unable to use proprietary software, is that from an ethical perspective, one of personal privacy/security, or something else? I'm not trying to be inflammatory, I'm genuinely curious.This is not a matter of which is prettier or which has the cutesy emoji support for me.If it's not IRC (or something like IRC) I can't use it.Hearing that Rust and other projects are migrating to proprietary platforms that I am unable to use makes me incredibly frustrated, and I'm trying not to rage about it, but it is incredibly marginalising to tell me that the only supported means for synchronous real-time communications are going to use proprietary protocols with clients that are unsuitable for me, and because they're proprietary nothing can be done about it.Also, do we really need a quad core i7 and hundreds of megabytes of RAM to send strings of text to one another? Really? Do we?Given all the talk about inclusivity from the Rust team I am very surprised that they seem to be ok with moving to a communication platform which makes it virtually impossible for people who use screen readers to participate.We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.No dataNo dataThat's because the GPL is extremely anti-business, and most large open source projects are spearheaded by businesses. One of the biggest reasons I like the rust community is that most projects are licensed under the MIT or Apache-2 licenses, and not the GPL.It actually is kind of upsetting, both from an ideological standpoint and even worse from an accessibility and privacy one.I think a main issue is that free software ideology is not really very popular anymore, even among the figurehead leaders of these open-source projects. Names such as ""Richard Stallman"" and the GNU project are spoken about in a crusty, old-farty, and almost crackpot kind of way and not given respect.Overall I just don't get this move at all when so many open-source alternatives are availableEDIT: remove mention of ""the GNU public license"", it was not supposed to be the focus of my commentI would also like to add that the accessibility issues are the most damning, and will lead to direct exclusion against many members of the community.I'm unable to type directly because of an RSI injury.Do you avoid all typing? Or just type minimally?Are there any specialized keyboards for this kind of situation? I can imagine speech recognition working in a lot of cases, but when you need precision + greater speed, there's no foot based keyboard or something?Hey, just in case you haven't run into it, wee-slack is a weechat plugin that provides most of slack. Could work for your case; I use it every day.I'm unable to type directly because of an RSI injury. I type using speech recognition and a lot of custom emacs code to go with it. One of the reasons I ended up using emacs was because the accessibility is in effect great -- since everything is treated as text, even ""graphical"" user interface elements -- if I use the emacs version of an ""app"" -- e.g. IRC, email, etc. all of my existing commands for manipulating text work seamlessly. I have written code to tear apart usernames and translate l33t speak into English fragments for a grammar so that I can then address who I want to speak to on IRC by name. Am I going to be able to do that on whatever new platform is chosen?My workplace adopted slack, which initially had XMPP support, but then they  abruptly dropped it. Embrace extend extinguish. They provide a slack API now, but because it's particular to them fewer clients exist. To slack's credit the accessibility of their web client is not terrible because their interface elements are real links, which means plug-ins like the one I use for chrome that hover a letter over each link which I can then say to click the link work. However there is no guarantee they won't arbitrarily change their client in the future and this will stop working. Open source provide a little bit of a safety for the disabled, because there is a better chance of the community being responsive to them and they can possibly even provide patches to address their needs.The problems I see with IRC for new people is that getting set up is overly obfuscated, the login method is dated, and you have to know about server splits so you can ghost your nick. I think if the community put a little effort into making setup easy, e.g. having a web client people can access without installing anything, having a normal username password login screen, etc. IRC or maybe one of the new open source contenders could be fine.Sometimes it is even convenient to have the discussions you have automatically saved and logged and in the cloud so that you can see them from other devices. I end up regularly having to search my slack history for things my coworkers have said. But it would be nice if each user had their own encrypted copy on the server and the option of keeping their key client side. But I am less worried about this than I am Discord, Slack, etc. one day on a whim releasing an update that completely ruins my ability to use them.I work with some blind colleagues on slack. Works fine, they say as well as IRC. There are many awful things about slack, but accessibility seems ok.Not very surprising. https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/173This, it’s mind boggling to me how they’re doing that.

LTT might make Videos about Linux Software,"I know they sounded uncertain here, but once the steam deck comes out I would not be surprised at ALL if they make a video like that.I don't know if I like that. On one hand, some things could use improvement and this would get things moving. On the other hand, most ""gamers"" aren't the ones I want to see driving Linux desktop development. I don't think it's good to cater to them because they whine.As of about last month, maybe.Regarding multi-monitor shenanigans on Linux: Wayland handles multi-monitor setups better than Xorg.Thanks for pointing it out. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have noticed that I was lying.Lmao this is is a flat-out lie. They never once said they might make videos about Linux Software. They never even implied that they might do it. Someone asked about more software videos, they talked about LSD ""Luke's Software Discoveries"" or whatever, and Luke basically said ""the only way it would work is if we did more Linux stuff because there isn't enough for Windows"" and that was the end of that discussion. Like there is zero chance this is happening, they didn't even imply it, Linus didn't seem at all interested, and this post should be deleted.Linux is quite capable for single player gaming. I thought LTT gave impression it was hit or miss with singleplayer, which is not case as a huge number of games work. It was obviously the case for them. ""A huge number of games"" means nothing if a few of your favorites are in the ""less huge number of SP games"" that don't work or have issues. People constantly focus on this 80% of the top 100 number like it means so much more than it does (and that's if we're taking ProtonDB's rating system at it's word, which is total nonsense and it's probably more like 70% of the top 100 are gold or better). That 20% includes a HUGE number of games, including single-player games, and it doesn't touch ANY non-Steam games. Do you know how many Windows gamers play games that aren't on Steam? Most of them, probably the vast majority. Yes, many, probably most non-Steam Windows SP games work too (I even said this on Intelligent Gaming's podcast that we recorded the other day but probably isn't uploaded yet), but that doesn't mean jack shit if your favorite game or one of your favorites, or even one of the games that isn't in your top 5 or 10 but you play once or twice a month and do really enjoy, don't work on Linux, or they are a pain in the ass to get working. And that brings me to: Giving impression that fragmentation is a bigger issue than it is. It's absolutely as big of an issue as they made it out to be. Just because D3D exclusivity (really D3D's dominance in the market, not its exclusivity) is also true doesn't mean that fragmentation isn't a huge issue. Even with what I was just saying above, for non-Steam games we had a fantastic solution that could have been (and should still be) the gold standard (and the only standard) for running non-Steam Windows games on Linux - Lutris. But yet we still have people trying to create alternatives and replacements and what have you. Bottles, GameHub, Heroic. No. Like, for the enthusiasts, little projects are fine, but Bottles and Heroic at least (idk about GH) are trying to become the new Lutris (I'm even hearing about Heroic adding GOG support), and are constantly being pushed by community members (and then you inevitably get 5 posts a day about someone who can't get a game to work through Heroic which works flawlessly with Lutris+EGS). We don't need a new Lutris. But the entire Linux experience is built on fragmentation. And if any one new project comes around that is really amazing and does some cool new shit? You can guarantee there will be 5 alternatives created within a year or two because the original didn't do one thing exactly how the creator of the new alternative wanted it to.I'll take a well executed and higher quality yearly review of gaming on Linux over a multiple videos like the challenge that was good but had inconsistencies. Giving impression that fragmentation is a bigger issue than it is. D3D exclusivity holds gaming on Linux back far more. If a native port can be justified, guess what? D3D makes it cost more, lessening the argument to port to Linux even more. For WINE it requires devs to reverse engineer, which takes time, resulting in games being less accessible or lack features. DXR is a perfect example of that. Its not fully supported through Proton because it takes time to reverse engineer. Wraping up video with 'year of Linux gaming question'. Excuse my french but we 'self censor'-ing know Linux is not ready for most people. Anthony who works for LTT could have told them that easily. So why approach challenges with that obvious question? Linux is quite capable for single player gaming. I thought LTT gave impression it was hit or miss with singleplayer, which is not case as a huge number of games work. Still I respect Linus and Luke and applaud them. But I hope next time they are more thorough. Would be nice to see them cover how D3D has, and still does to degree, cripple Linux gaming momentum. If Vulkan did not exist you could say bye bye to FSR and DLSS on Linux.I have a GTX 1060 and an RTX 3090 - I assume he's using a docking station or something ekse that's causing the issue. I've run a 3-display setup before, never had issues except related to shittiy cables, etc. I'd actually love to connect with him and help him out - bummerNvidia is still making life difficult for Luke then.I'm on Pop with Nvidia 1650 in a laptop, with a secondary display that I constantly connect and disconnect, I haven't noticed any issues. My friend is running Manjaro with a 1660Ti laptop, again with an external monitor that's constantly connected and disconnected with no issues. Perhaps it's a Mint specific issue? Would Cinnamon have anything to do with it maybe?The issue Luke had with Mint happened to my son as well with his laptop. It randomly stopped outputing to an external display. It's an Nvidia 1060 laptop so I'm wondering if its a Nvidia driver issue that shows itself if you regularly connect and disconnect the display? As far as I know my son hasn't installed any updates.Hey, I have a pretty good career just because I can read and follow instructions.To be honest I just opened pamac on my manjaro, clicked to install OBS which took about 10 second including typing my password, opened it and started recording after looking at the program's settings. It worked completely fine recording at 1440-120fps and my mic was detected correctly first time. With NVENC already selected as default. I can't imagine how another computer with the same OS can be different, even CUDA (a right PITA to get working on Ubuntu) worked out of the box in blender for me on Manjaro. Despite people's criticisms of the distro, I find it hard not to recommend for nvidia users...Fwiw if you install the OBS flatpak - it just works iircYes you are miles beyond the average user lol, people do not want to fix things or follow tutorials and learn how to get things running.Yeah if you know how to git clone, you're far beyond most users.I can see the headlines now: ""Person comprehends GitHub instructions, praised as minor deity""All the issues they have had around linux is wild to me. I came back to Linux when they started talking about it and went with notorious meme os Fedora. I have had no issues really. Getting the NVFBC installed and working for OBS was the most difficult task. Then again I am not confused by github and feel comfortable using the arcane command line to git clone a repo so maybe my tech skills of reading and following instructions is just so far beyond most people.I still don't get why they didn't include Anthony in the ""Linux Gaming Challenge"" Because that's impossible. It's a Linux Gaming Challenge where people try to daily drive Linux. Anthony daily drives Linux already. Lmao it's literally in his twitter bio. Screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/MBwNb3f.jpgI think the reason is they wanted to go into it with no real experience, I would be interested in watching Anthony review it but the approach was for a newbie and semi newbie to try to get it all going.Anthony doesn’t really give a windows 10 user moving to Linux experience. He’s much more experienced and I think already uses it. But like I said I’d like to see him review their experiencesI would love to see Anthony getting in on this too, I agreeI still don't get why they didn't include Anthony in the ""Linux Gaming Challenge""; then they would have three levels of understanding of computers and operating systems; Linus, a complete Linux noob. For him the terms personal computer and Windows can be used more or less interchangeably. Luke, someone who has used Linux for personal computing. Likes things to just work, but understands a bit more of how Linux works internally and the organisational and political issues of Linux-kernel vs GNU vs distro vs DE. Anthony, someone who actually knows Linux (I think? Or has he fooled me?). Someone who (hopefully?) can compile or at least use a gaming optimised kernel, Wayland, bleeding edge and optimised compatibility layers (such as proton-ge and wine-ge), etc. My thought is that watching Linus use KDE with goofy fonts does not really give a serious impression. I think seeing a beautiful and personalised Sway, or even Wayland Gnome or Wayland KDE, used by someone who knows his shit would both be more interesting to viewers and potentially incentivise additional people to try out different flavours of Linux. I mean, freedom of choice and diversity is good, right? I think even non-technical people would find a well oiled Linux desktop experience cool to watch. How much time would it take a top-tier Linux user to do all the Linux-challenges? 2 minutes? 5 minutes?It sounded like they would like to make Linux videos - Luke was certainly onboard with it - but as Linus mentioned, their target views for their videos is 1M+ these days.  The Linux Challenge videos broke that, but those videos also have broad appeal.  I bet most of his audience would love to ditch Windows for good, and there have been quite a few new converts in the Linux subs where I am active.  But they both seemed to doubt that more narrow-focused Linux content would drive those numbers (I think Linus specifically mentioned a comment about an Unraid series). I hope they do a few videos to try it out or start a sub-channel for it Linux content like they did for Mac.  It would be easy to pass around to the various Linux subs on Reddit.I don't really feel like the way LTT does things is set up for Linux software reviews. Where I think there is a lot of potential though, is in that general ""can it run out of the box on Linux, do I need to use proton, or do I need to do more"" type things.They don't but they have people on staff that doIf they were to like highlight new interesting FOSS projects that would be cool and probably valued by the community but I frankly don't think they have the domain knowledge of the ecosystemI'm sure they'll revisit things around the Steam Deck launch, and perhaps again when Steam OS 3 is released. Hopefully the next few months will have more games with anti-cheat getting support, which will make it a lot more attractive for Windows gamers.They need to just give Anthony a channel already and let him run with it. Linus got his Linux series. Now let someone make the videos that could educate a user like Linus.Agreed but I continued letting the video run to follow a discussion in the recorded chat when I heard another mention: ""[...] we could potentially do a Linux channel that has lower expectations at some point but we haven't done that yet."" No doubt in response to viewers constantly asking when Anthony Young will get his own show. :-DMaybe they should try to showcase free open-source software in general instead. A lot of good FOSS is also available on Mac+Windows, and is a great way to get people thinking about ethics in software before converting them all the way to an open-source OS.So there’s a few aspects to it that I welcome:We haven’t heard from Anthony at all yet regarding the LTT challenge. He daily drives Linux apparently, just like a few other LTT staff do. Getting an in house expert to test things would be great. It’s as simple has having a stable Linux OS on one of their test bench SSDs. Simply stating whether a hardware product has Linux drivers or not, or a game pledges Linux support would be 100% welcome.Saying they might make videos about Linux software is breaching too far. It sounds like they haven't even decided if they will continue to make any more videos about Linux.",54,2270,0.023788546,0.023788546,1,2266,35.54,13.81,35.14,68.17,22.66,18.05,83.98,69.51,55.47,13.06,7.15,3.18,0.44,0.71,0.66,1.9,5.91,12.8,5.6,2.03,12.27,10.06,6.84,6.88,2.47,18.45,6.22,5.69,3,0.75,1.85,0.44,17.21,0.88,16.28,2.96,1.9,3,4.41,1.28,5.6,0,4.32,3.57,0.53,1.19,0.93,0.22,0,0.04,0,0.26,8.03,2.91,0.35,0.31,0.09,0.04,1.54,4.81,0.09,0,0,0.75,0.97,0.04,0.04,0.88,4.32,1.5,0.44,2.25,0.13,0,0.49,0.13,0.09,0.04,0,0.09,0,0.18,0,0.22,0.44,0.97,0.13,0.09,0,0.04,0.04,0.4,7.15,6.71,0.44,1.24,3.66,0.84,0.35,0.35,3.05,3.22,5.83,0.84,0.53,0.4,0.13,0,0.04,16.37,5.21,3.22,0.62,0,3.13,4.19,

Least bloated unix software manager for MacOS,"I've been (mostly happily) using Homebrew for quite a while.  Two key pieces of software (Frescobaldi & Lilypond) are bringing me back to MacPorts because the versions in Homebrew are incomplete.basically devs of homebrew are assholesRust as a dependency to something. I know for a fact that none of the software I might care to get should depend of RustThe fact that Homebrew is installing it disagrees with you.What were you trying to actually install? You can look at the associated script to see why it is using rust.Homebrew doesn't just randomly install things.Interestingly I use Homebrew for most of the same reasons you sight above after having very bad relations with MacPorts.   HomeBrew does have precompiled packages and frankly isn't any worse at excess installs than anything else.In the end Stack Exchange is probably right in that this is opinion based.   Bu on my M1 MBA Homebrew has been a champ with ARM native software that just works.I have been using Macports for a very long time and it is mu favorite package manager. I had tried Homebrew long time ago but I didn't like it due to the bugs I encountered.Macports have been distributing precompiled binaries for the last couple of years, so by default installation of software is very fast. In addition the version select system of macports make my workflows very efficient.As you asked about installing all the low level dependencies(kitchen-sink), I prefer that way. Because while it may look unnecessary, those dependencies are usually precompiled binaries and they are used to build a known and optimized platform to build the softwares, which makes macports much more robust than homebrew.The storage of those packages are negligible. I have installed hundreds of software for development purposes and the whole /opt/local directory uses only 4.6 GB of space, so it is not a problem in comparison with the flexibility come with macports package management features. As long as one also run uninstall inactive packages after upgrades, the storage requirement is very low.Lastly, since Apple is infamous for altering their softwares without considerations, Macports' way of building the whole unix environment without depending Apple is much better.Personally, I also write package declarations for my private software in Macports, I find it very easy to do that and I frankly don't understand why most people even use and invest on homebrew. If the same time had been invested on Macports, I'm pretty sure Macports would have become maybe the best package manager in all platforms, including Linux.Nix",10,422,0.023696683,0.023696683,1,430,51.56,12.26,45.11,36.9,35.83,28.6,80,66.05,53.26,10.93,5.81,4.19,0,1.16,0,0.47,5.12,11.4,5.58,1.16,14.42,10.23,7.44,6.05,1.4,16.74,6.98,5.35,3.02,0,1.86,1.4,16.28,0.7,15.12,2.09,5.12,1.16,3.49,0.7,3.49,0,2.79,1.86,0.7,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,0,0.23,4.19,1.86,0.23,0,0.23,0,0.7,2.09,0,0,0,0,2.09,0.23,0,1.86,1.86,0,0.23,1.63,0.47,0,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0.23,0,0.23,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0.47,7.21,6.74,0.47,0.93,4.88,0.93,0,0,3.02,3.49,6.05,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,12.33,5.35,2.79,0.23,0,1.63,2.33,

Also, in that particular software niche it's common to have the code audited before going live. He didn't do that. He deployed it himself to live.Hey, Belgian software engineer
And I believe the limitation of liability in the MIT license is valid in belgium in most cases. It is however impossible to limit your liability in case of gross negligence, wilful acts or death. So unless the bug was so obvious and reckless that it could be considered gross negligence, you can't be held liable.I'm going to take a wild guess and say if you're coding for what sounds like WAY too little, you're probably what is called ""judgement proof"" anyway.ask an actual lawyerI use that license all the time. It literally states there is no warranty.  But I only use it for free open source projects, so users should not complain. Maybe selling it might be a gray zone, but I don't think you should worry. Literally just refer to the license when user complainsTalk to a lawyer. I'm a lawyer in another jurisdiction, and in my country the limitation of liability in the MIT license is null and void, and you could definitely be held liable (depending on some other factors)We did the transaction on fiverr because he has cash there.That's on him for being cheap. (This is not legal advice, just an opinion)Thanks!Hi! I'm a lawyer in Belgium but this is not my specialty. Therefore I can't give you any advice about your specific problem. I will, however, give you some advice on where you can get some affordable legal advice. First thing you can do is call ""Het Justitiehuis"" from your city (for example Justitiehuis Gent, Justitiehuis Brussel, ...). They can give you a short, free legal advice on the phone. If this doesn't answer your question, then you can go to the ""Wetswinkel"". There you can get legal advice for 15 euro's (it's like a legal clinic).Yes, but the buyer can argue that you corresponded with him on the issue.  If you sent the MIT license and asked the client to agree with that and than delivered the software it was 100% waterproof.
If you didn't let him agree with eh MIT license and provided after sales service, even by replying some mails, that means you don't act according to the MIT license...  It's a bit dubious..  But indeed, go to a lawyer.
That's the exact reason I completely stopped as a web and webshop developer in 2019.

I am an author of wfview and Linux is the only OS I use. I seriously have every capability I’d ever want with Linux. There is so much great software in linux that I can’t even get to all of it. I do digital modes, satellites, HF nets, you name it I do it and I only do it under linux. If I need some kind of proprietary crap to use my radio then I get a radio that doesn’t need that crap. But that said most radios really do not need windows anymore. We’ve come a long way.But seriously, there is a lot of great native Linux ham radio software. What kind of software? Which distro are you running? fldigi is good for some of the digital modes, wsjtx has a Linux version, and there are a bunch of logging programs. If you are on Debian/Ubuntu based distro, I would start with an apt search ham. Embrace linux native apps and don’t try and hack it together with wine. You will have such a better time of it.Forked version of librtlsdr - provides some extra features over rtl-sdr libraries with most Linux distributions to work your RTL based dongles.

Linux software to change and tweak color and contrast settings of display,"Please elaborate. Is this an app I have to install?I think  xrandr  can tweak those.Yes, I use windows. In that, my display looks better because of the intel graphics command center which allows me to tweak the display colors and make it more vibrant and punchy.This is the only thing stopping me from making the switch. Can you explain what ""the switch"" means? Are you trying to switch from Windows to Linux? Does your display look good in Windows, but not Linux? Also, can you check to see (in Linux) if there are any settings enabled like Blue Light Filter, or Night Mode?is this a distro?On X KDE can do this natively. It's in the display settings.That's impressive! Sadly I don't have that equipment so I just try and make do with increasing the contrast and colours of the displayHow are you making some tweaks currently? Do you use a colourimeter? If so, you can use DisplayCAL on Linux. Make sure your colourimeter is compatible, though. I use the DataColor Spyder 3 Pro with great success.Please elaborate.. this seems to be the only way to tweak colour and contrast of the display. Can you link some guides?I don't know if there is a GUI for it, but that kind of configuration can be done using xrandr I believe...Read this and search for a ""ICC profile"" for your laptop.

ML bugs vs. traditional software bugs,"It is used a lot in statistics and probability, which is an underpinning of machine learning models. A specific example is in Bayesian probability where we distinguish between prior and posterior distributions.Random question. Is a priori commonly used in ML? First I’ve seen the term used outside of Logic/Philosophy.Sage Wisdom: the bug can be anywhere leading up to the model output, including within the annotation process itself.Exactly sometime we dont even have a base performance to compare and debugging so fucking hard.I wish it were that simple. Head over to r/mlops, where we joke about it, but inside we're all morbidly freaked out.Right, because there are no ""traditional software"" bugs that degrade performance...Biggest errors I’ve come across in software were silent. For example, our front end assumed an encrypted string key while we passed the content unencrypted leading to a 100% cache miss rate. Proper monitoring would have identified it fast but we didn’t have that lol.Yes, in the old days (punched tape and drums) just weird behaviour /loops / crash (more literal).A fair point. Silently passing bugs, off by one errors and other similar issues can be very hard to find.All software engineer bugs give error is such a bold assumption.I have “relatively fast convergence” phobiaYeah, such a model would be making psychic predictions haha.And the incentives to keep those inflated metrics and only look into the model when they go downTrue!

A guy from the street like me will have to get hard time ;-) Anyways, I parked my problems until my C4 arrives...You need a star diagnostics device for coding on Mercedes. Whoever told you 1k aed each(highly unlikely) to do those 3 things you mentioned is nuts. Don't ever step into that shop. Call around and ask if they have the star diagnostics. Many shops will have the Chinese clone. Places like silver arrows will certainly have the real deal. Obviously the rates will vary as the cline software shops can do it for cheaper. Ideally it should not cost more than 300-500aed  for everything you want (depending on time taken as well)silly things, display units on the cluster (km/l - to - l/100km) & lights coding (aka tourist mode) to flatten the beam - all doable with merc software in few mins...What changes exactly? I’ll check with a workshop owner I know and let you know how much he wants then!no sir, wouldn't risk my car's ecu on pirated soft for that... too much at stakeCan’t you find a torrent of the software?

Microsoft and the Linux Foundation have sent out a joint letter against creating liability for software defects,"While I agree with the sentiment that software liability laws are uninformed, this article is just terribly written. It concludes ""Maybe your software company should sue you."" Sue you for what? Where the fuck did this non sequitur come from?No one wants to get in trouble because their software interacted badly with a poorly written driver or because of a bug that couldn't be caught with the tools they were using to develop.  Software isn't a physical object, any damage it does is (usually, the intel ethernet driver blunder is a different story) is to data, which you SHOULD be backing up.To the contrary. The company behind Ubuntu could be sued into the ground, which would be very bad indeed, but the source code is still available so a new company could be started.Linux has much more to lose than microsoft.  A ruling like this could completely put linux underground.  One major lawsuit and Ubuntu is gone.  Another one and Firefox is gone.Kumbaya, Lord!In other news, the Infernal Ski Club has opened in Hell to take advantage of the unseasonably cold weather.Clearly they secretly downloaded and read your novel before destroying it ""accidentally"", for the sake of mankind.Sorry, what?On the other hand, instead of adding to the bloat, projects could improve on reliability...

Software is just too complex to expect it to work 100% reliably. Look at the ""they write the right stuff"" article. It costs them 80 times as much per line of code to write no-fault software. If you expected everyone else to live up to the same standards there would be NO new software development, it would just be too darned expensive.They're applying the old business model to technology again.

My Pixel 5 Experience with software bugs.,"I think i had some bugs before android 12 but they became significantly more since 12.Would you be so kind and share with us after which update this behavior started happening. A lot of people seem to have problems after the upgrade to Android 12 (and that's probably the reason why the Pixel 6 lineup is also plagued with similar problems) while they had little to none on Android 11.The OP probably means the Google Pixel XL... but I agree, that it doesn't add to the credibility.Pixel 5 is the worst pixel, it's just a placeholder release. But these bugs are more about android 12, since people have been complaining about pixel 6 having the same issuesIt's a shit show. I the phone didn't even last 2 years for me. Lately I have a bug where chrome doesn't let me Google stuff, I can type but that's it. Nothing else is happening. Need to kill task every time to fix that.I have the same problems with the pixel 5 in the las 3 weeks, and i also got some ugly screen burning marks, but i guess this is the price of an Oled panel.I have a Pixel 5 with Android and don't have any of these issues, literally none of the issues...

Need advice on Software PM role - iOS/Andriod/Desktop all in one solution,"Building for Android and iOS with react native comes with its own headaches. The ""build it once, and it works everywhere"" is true so long as you haven't done anything complicated. Also, anything built will be complicated. The real selling point of RN is that javascript devs can build it (easy to find) rather than having to find native developers. Another trap is device support. You will have to decide if you want it work perfectly on one type of device first or build simultaneously which will slow down the process (increased testing, trickier coding). You definitely don't want your goal to be perfection on iPhones 8-13 and the vast Android ecosystem from the jump. Consider market share, and target the most important devices.Exactly. I’m part of mobile and web app team, and we’ve got 3 PM covering across all of it.  Depending on engineering team / product size it could work out, but keeping all the apps in a feature parity state is extremely challenging.  We started out with parity as the goal, but one decision lead to another and they are pretty disconnected now.Idk how big the app/team is, but I'd suggest you to be careful not to get burned out, as ownership for 3 platforms might be too much for 1 person. I've done iOS+Android and it wasn't easy. But again, depends on the scale. On #2 you can get a lot of info online on product vs project mng. Two things I'd point out specifically to mobilean important part is related to the operational part of releasing updates. It can be a pain in the ass, especially on iOS... and your QA/QE needs to be spot on, otherwise it can turn out into a nightmare if critical bugs are found in production. On web it's much easier Take into account that iOS and Android have their own particularities, so you need to get accustomed to them and include this thought when planning the roadmap (have a general one + specific per platform)Thanks. My impression is they've been siloed up to this point, however, if React Native would deliver a solution that's on par I'd prefer to go with one code base for cross platform compatibility. I programmed many years ago but am out of the loop as far as what's popular today for this kind of project.In regards to #1, are you referencing a framework/ language? React Native should offer you cross platform availability while staying true to what many people already know. If you’re developing in siloed languages for each, you might run into differences (Swift, React, and Java, for instance)TRUE.Don’t worry about the how.

Nerdy Linux software question,"You can use pacman / yay with one minute effort. With this tools you can install whatever you want.But its always better to install all tools to the home partition, because Steam updates cant kill them.Flatpaks are better because you can reasonably be sure you'll be able to add them as non-Steam game and they will run in game mode. With the other you have no guarantee and itch.io for example doesn't work in game mode (because in game mode the Linux apps run under pressure-vessel, the Valve sandbox, and have only access to the Steam Linux Runtime).Itch just runs it’s own installer into your home partition, it’s fine. No different to downloading a plain exe on Windows, Linux has it’s own form of that tooThat makes sense. The thing that made me run into this initially was trying to add some unofficial Arch software repositories, and it seems like you can't do that without disabling read-only. I'm definitely not enough of a Linux pro to know why that is.What doesn't work is installing software to the read-only partitions. Any software downloaded and installed to the read/writeable user home partition /home/deck/... will work.

"New Australian-made ""kamikaze"" drone swarm technology currently being tested in Poland - 300 units to be sent to Ukraine ASAP for use against Russian equipment and personnel. Interesting news clip.","I like the word swarms .I assumed from the title they don’t drop the payload but rather crash into the target exploding on impact. It’s an incredibly effective tactic in the battlefield video game series.Give it a week, we'll have footage from the fieldIt drops jars of Vegemite. Twist in the story, the jars are full of huntsman and blue ringed octopus. We couldn't fit any emus in.I’d like to see this in action ie dropping the warhead how far it could go etcCan someone test it in Kremlin?*Reddit war theories.These drones are originally invented in South Korea.Which makes you wonder why Russia isn't on the ball with counter-drone tech like small scale jammers. Oh wait, they are still fighting with the ""throw more men at the problem"" doctrine.All wars are tech development arenas.This reminds me of the Spanish civil war…its what they did during the Spanish civil war before WW2 as well.This is every war, but this one in particular has so much foreign tech going to aid Ukraine. To test on Z.Looks like the average human life will be about 500 dollars. Regular infantry cant fight individual targeted bombs from above. My guess is that armies will have to create counter equipment or just recognize that infantry will be extremely vulnerable from now on.the Spanish civil war did that before WW2 it's all par for the course hell I'm sure we could look at a pre WW2 war and say the same .... The Russo Japanese war maybee or the Chinese warlord period? I think the Chinese warlord period fits better, if I recall correctly a bunch of European nations selected warlord and supplies em militarily jus before and into WW1 ..... I could b wrong though that info I learned 12 ish years agoExperiments are amazing. We get to see the evolution of warfare. We see how enemies react to the unfamiliar, how it affects morale over time. We see how to better implement experimental equipment. With the enemy not being able to predict, we gain an advantage.Syria really has been the testbed for the last decade or so.  The Russians tested aircraft and ground vehicles there.It is crazy.  I can’t imagine being a ground troop with all these drones out there.   I mean….holy crap.   You gotta have air defense at all times and never group up.   These seem like it would really change warfare.Even if Ukraine wins and Russia somehow turns into a peaceful democracy, the world will have only gained more ingenuity and proficiency at mass murder. The next military conflict will be the nightmare only dreamt of in sci-fi horrors.This is how humanity drifts off course further into dystopian Black Mirror type robot dogs.Like every warEastern Ukraine is the world's largest testing range for modern weapons. Want to know the smallest rocket that can disable the latest russian tanks? Want to see how your drones do against russian radio blocking tech? Curious how your mobile artillery manages real world scenarios Send it to Ukraine and show it off the the world.The thing is that 90% of the new and revolutionary technology is on the Ukraine side^Exactly this^The world knows this is a war, but because rus has not formally declared it as such, it can't bitch to the international community about ""war crimes"" being levied upon it. That means rus is essentially sending its troops out as live meatbags for real-world testing of experimental weaponry. I for one would like to thank the rus troops for taking part in this exercise, where they sacrifice their bodies, so that other countries can test lethal weaponry in real-world situations.The Russians taking one for the team by showing everything not to do and not to build...
(OK, not completely true, but hey...)This is why you need friends in the world. You don’t just give experimental military technology to anyone, you give it to those you trust. The fact Australia is giving weapons to Ukraine, two countries that have almost nothing in common, just goes to show how strong the democracies of the world are when we unite. Authoritarian countries like Russia and China have no real friends. Only friends of convenience who will abandon them the second it no longer benefits them. Because other countries know authoritarians are selfish and only care about themselves and it’s why they always fail.Russian Ukrainian War- Real world testing ground for prototypes, war theories and combat equipment.Please remember the human.

New technology helps control advanced symptoms of Parkinson's,"I simply don't know what else to say but bless you and your family.Incredible. One of my relatives has Parkinson's and has disclosed to me that the shaking and swinging from Parkinson's is simply unbearable to the point of suicidal thoughts. He has a stimulator device implanted in his chest along with medication which allows his life to be bearable. He's still uneasy on his feet and has lost some strength, but he for the most part isn't a prisoner in his body anymore. Parkinson's is a horrible disease. I'm so grateful that medical science has come so far.He was my favourite actor ever since I was a kid. Really connected with him because he was such a shortass like me. I really hope soIt's not the physical symptoms keeping him from acting right now, but the cognitive ones. Medication and the disease prevent him from being able to memorize more than a paragraph of dialogue.He went with a different procedureHe was great on Curb your Enthusiasm. ""Did you embellish the clomping on the floor?"" ""A little."" ""And did you embellish the shaking of the soda?"" ""........yeah."" ""Okay good"" ""....hey, you want a coke?"" ""No thank you, I decline"" "".............pussy""“Deep Brain Stimulation” I’d say this technology is not suited for everyone with Parkinson’s disease. This is available in Australia, and we do it all the time at my hospital. With Michael j fox, one would assume that if he wanted this treatment, he would find someone to perform it as cost is not an issue.Parkinson’s is more than shakes. My dad has been diagnosed for 8 years and doesn’t shake. It steals your mind slowly but surly. He built their house. He has so many old car projects he wanted to do in retirement. Parkinson’s has taken all his skill. He can still speak but he’s hard to understand. It’s put a tremendous strain on my mom and my family in general. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.He still acts but only in very specific roles. Also, what you see in MJF is a lot more the side effects of what he has taken as attempts to treat Parkinson’s rather than just pd itself. MJF is a fucking hero for the community tho. If it weren’t for him there wouldn’t be half the knowledge about the disease as there is now.This isn’t new tech. Michael J probably already has this, unfortunately over time even this treatment will stop working. Fox has been spending his life running his foundation, making sure the right trials get funded to hopefully one day find a cure to parkinsons. But also for trials for better drugs that are more tolerable among other things. They have actually already funded some very promising studies/trials that could eventually forge the path to a cureUnlikely, Parkinson’s is a progressive disease which currently does not have any definitive treatments. This may help with symptoms but I really doubt this will change any decisions he has made about acting.So you're saying we could see Michael J Fox act again? That's not a joke or jab at the man. I genuinely miss that dude on TV. Feel like the world was better then.It's really amazing technology. My grandfather had Parkinson's, and it's a truly awful disease. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. The fix came a little too late for him, but this will absolutely change lives.Just in time for Back to the Future Part FourDbs is a really common treatment to increase the work of meds.I hope that it become available world wideMy dad is terminal and watching this guy have this horrible problem solved just makes me really happy.  I can't imagine the absolute joy, the sheer astonishment of the loved ones of those who have Parkinsons.  To anyone who has lost a loved one to disease or illness I'm sure you can relate, that it would be something TRULY miraculous to watch them suddenly be cured.  Sure it's not the same necessarily with life and death, but to have such a life altering problem be solved would be completely amazing and surreal.I’m case anyone is wondering, Parkinson’s is a nuerodegenerative disease that causes a breakdown of the central nervous system. It’s visible symptoms are tremors like we see here. Eventually all motor control will fade and the end result is death.This is actually widely available in the US and most other countries. Got invented several decades ago. Check out Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for more info. It doesn't usually get prescribed except as a last resort (after medication has stopped working) or if the patient asks for it. Although relatively safe, implantation of the DBS leads is still a neurosurgery which requires a neurosurgeon with dedicated training. And a dedicated neurologist willing to work the patient for a month or two to get the stimulation settings right.In America this will easily cost $100,000 cuz capitalismThats actually fuckin dope.

They'd come in with some issue involving an older technology, and pretend the world was passing them by.This ""Home Box Office"" you keep referring to. Who works in this office, and must I allow them into my home if I want to watch a movie? Who shall cover the cost of food and lodging for this individual? Is it humane to make them work in my home when I want to watch a movie late at night?Good grief, I can understand them not being totally up to date with tech, but HBO has been around since the 70s! This ""Home Box Office"" you keep referring to.  Who works in this office, and must I allow them into my home if I want to watch a movie?  Who shall cover the cost of food and lodging for this individual?  Is it humane to make them work in my home when I want to watch a movie late at night? Yeah, the author of the Business Insider article didn't check into the Mashable article, which was apparently written by someone who didn't actually read the oral argument transcript. Scalia asked why a decision allowing retransmission of local stations wouldn't permit retransmission of HBO. He asked this question after mentioning ""distant signals,"" which refers to non-local broadcasts (e.g. WGN, which is broadcast in Chicago and also carried by cable providers across the country).  There are thus three possible interpretations of Scalia's question: 1) he thinks HBO is a local broadcast channel somewhere; 2) he thinks ""distant signals"" means everything on cable that isn't a local rebroadcast; or 3) he picked a bad example off the top of his head or otherwise misspoke. The Mashable article assumed interpretation #1 without really discussing it. This seems rather unlikely. The guy watches some TV (although here he says he has ""CDs"" of Seinfeld, so that's not helping my argument). He says he watched The Sopranos, which was on HBO. It would be weird if he didn't know where the show came from. #2 is also pretty unlikely since Scalia worked on cable regulation in the early 70s under Nixon (when distant signals had already been a legal issue for cable companies and were subject to ongoing regulation). #3 seems reasonably probable, since all of the justices say things of varying stupidity during oral arguments (with the exception of Justice Thomas). So I'd say its at best 50/50 between Scalia thinking HBO is a broadcast channel and Scalia using a poor example or asking a question that didn't follow from his previous ""distant signals"" comment (i.e. maybe he meant to say ""If you can do this for local signals, why not for distant signals? And why not for HBO?""). The quote from the WaPo article I linked saying he has CDs of Seinfeld does demonstrate that the justices aren't super tech-savvy, though. Good thing 26-year-old law clerks write their opinions for them. Edit: I'll also note that somehow Mashable concluded that the 5 more liberal justices were all more tech-savvy than any of the four most conservative justices, with the rankings of the conservative justices conveniently aligning with the typical liberal sentiment toward them (Scalia is the worst, Roberts the best). So a bit of a credibility problem there, which leads me to question whether their criticisms are valid.If they could just figure out how to get politics to go faster through the series of tubes....This is because of the huge generation gap between politics and modern technology.The type of person who becomes a Supreme Court justice probably isn't the same type of person with much time to watch cable t.v.My grandma calls it 'Intendo.' Our cat is named pyewacket, but she insists on saying pyewhack. She knows what she's doing I think.Oh well that's just wonderful.Term limits don't necessarily make for younger electeds, though. Plenty of old members get replaced by older members. It sounds like you'd like a maximum age for elected officials, just like there's a minimum age.Why doesn't being a Senate staffer constitute experience? Senate staffers have to understand things at a pretty technical level.Phonograph recordings is legal speak for recordings of all types, no matter what medium they're played back on.I like how they think that is experience in ""tech"". That means nothing. Yeah he sounds really tech savvy....nope, the lot of them My personal theory is that anyone with any practical insight gets frustrated on day one and takes their hands off the monkeysphere.Neil deGrasse Tyson for President!That's the root of the problem.It would be interesting if tech had a larger voice in politics besides lobbying. The only real technology centric political groups I know of are in Europe.  The way our system in USA is though a tech advocate party doesn't have nearly the platform it needsBecause engineers (among others) generally enjoy creating value, not stealing and misappropriating it.I think you nailed a big part of it. Where the hell are the engineers in Congress?Actually I 'd be more comfortable with a Supreme Court justice who says ""Netflick"" and has some integrity than with a tech-savvy corporatist-fascist who believes that bribery is free speech. Reason: It's relatively easy to get up to speed on the basics of an unfamiliar technology, but integrity can't be taught.Frankly, I think one of the more understated issues facing this nation is the general ignorance of science and technology enjoyed by the vast majority of people in leadership positions in this nation at all levels of government. We have plenty of business people, lawyers, and various activists engaged in government roles, but we are seriously lacking in engineers, scientists and technologists who really understand how this stuff works.",17,1127,0.015084295,0.015084295,1,1130,58.01,31.64,57.79,44.03,25.68,22.21,88.05,68.76,53.19,13.1,7.35,2.21,0.35,0.53,1.59,1.86,5.75,13.98,7.08,2.04,13.72,8.14,6.19,5.31,1.95,16.11,6.55,3.63,5.66,0.8,1.24,3.81,16.46,0.97,15.4,3.89,2.39,1.59,3.01,0.88,4.51,0,3.98,2.57,0.97,1.24,0.62,0.53,0,0.35,0.09,0.35,11.77,4.69,0.27,0,0.35,0.97,2.39,6.64,0.09,0,0.35,1.42,4.78,3.27,0,1.5,5.04,1.24,0.62,2.65,0.53,0.18,0.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.35,0.35,0.53,0.27,0.18,0,0,0.27,0.53,4.6,8.32,0.71,0.71,6.73,0.8,0.18,0,4.34,3.19,6.37,0.71,0.53,0.09,0.35,0.18,0,17.52,5.84,3.1,1.06,0.27,2.57,4.69,
"Overweight and riddled with electronic/software defects, the new German F125 frigate does nevertheless look the part [3404 x 2237]","Many navies, especially in Europe, seem to prefer to call even actual destroyers (like the Horizons) frigates.Sounds like our MOD as a whole.

Frigate sounds less threatening. Not that the F125s necessarily warrant the term 'destroyer', but the F124s and F123 surely do.Meh, Russia has a 2,200 tonne corvette and America has a 15,000 tonne 'destroyer'. Seems about the current average.What were those defects ?According to the german navy's spokesperson she's within weight specifications and the list was greatly reduced.They're probably only designed to ferry refugees across the Mediterranean anyway.I wrote a post on how the only redeeming feature of your comment was that it was grammatically correct.This thing is heavy for a frigate, surprised it's not classified as a destroyer.",7,376,0.018617021,0.018617021,1,372,67.01,38.5,9.07,3.96,41.33,20.7,81.72,64.52,55.11,11.83,5.11,1.08,0.27,0.27,1.08,1.88,6.72,16.94,11.56,3.49,12.9,9.41,5.38,6.45,2.15,13.71,5.91,3.23,4.3,0.54,0.27,3.49,11.29,1.08,10.22,2.69,1.88,1.34,2.42,0.81,2.96,0,5.11,1.34,3.49,1.34,0.81,0.27,0,0,0,0,7.53,2.69,0.27,0,0.27,0.27,1.61,5.38,0,0,1.08,0.27,1.88,0.54,0.81,0.54,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.54,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0.27,0.54,4.57,7.53,1.08,0.81,4.03,1.08,0.81,0.54,1.61,2.96,6.72,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,22.04,8.06,3.76,1.61,0.27,5.65,2.69,

Picard explaining technological advancement to a member of pre-industrial civilization - I love this show,"What I particularly love about this is it’s such a respectful and non-condescending explanation between people from essentially two different time periods. Yes, he is ultimately leading to a conclusion, but in essence only because he has external access to knowledge and technology she doesn’t and can’t possibly have, but he trusts and understands her cognitive ability to reason and figure that same conclusion out logically when given a new perspective. Hence he is talking to her much as he would talk to an intelligent person from his own time, just with the awareness that she has a different frame of reference than his own.And it's also why I was so upset with star trek picard. It was all flash and no substance.It's scenes like this one where Picard explains some profound lesson that made him such a strong male role model for me growing up.Ain't nothing like a man cave.Don’t worry, all cave dwellers and aliens speak English, so we can easily teach you.Ah, sweet man made horrors beyond my comprehension.If you really apply yourself, one day, you might achieve a life in a hut!You know I’m something of a cave dweller myself.Highly recommend you watch What We Left Behind immediately after you finish.  It's a great coda for the series. DS9 was my first pandemic binge.  I liked all the Trek series but had never gotten into DS9 because of the serial nature.  I had no idea what I was missing.  Amazing character work.My wife and I did the same. We started with TNG, Voyager. Now we are just wrapping up the last few episodes of DS9. I have a feeling we will end up doing it all over again. But probably without Voyager then next time.Please give Voyager a chance once you finish DS9. It has more consistently good episodes than TNG in my opinion, though there are some stinkers.I'll pigging back the top comment to say this, if you enjoy TNG, DS9, Voyager, you definitely need to check out The Orville. It really is the spiritual successor to 90' Star Trek. It's available on Disney+ in the Canada and the US. Go watch that show.I love all of em. Even the ""super cheesy"" 70's stuff with Shatner (actually those were amazing lol)I prefer Voyager. I like the idea of being lost and traveling in unknown galaxies.  Plus there is 7 of 9.As a ST fan.. You're in for a treat. DS9 is my pick.It's so good, damn. I finally watched all of it over the Pandemic. One of my new favorite series. And tonight I just started the 4th season of DS9.

Powershell script to remove traces of software? (Microsoft Office),"Thanks for your input :) Though am looking for a script that could run in the background to minimise any disruption to users.How about going to the source? https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8Yes am aware of this. The challenge is that as admins we have to provide the admin password each time for the end-user to uninstall. Also that we have to ask the user to do so -  We are trying to automate everything in the background to be more efficient. A script to remove the traces would be ideal to minimise any disruption on the users side.office has a built in too for this. (several including add/remove programs)Don't waste time. Wipe an reinstall  the OS and everything.I can agree with that. The challenge I suppose is that the intial setup process would take more time. For more context, laptops are shipped to users and we aim to provide a zero-touch service where the user just logs in and the software is all deployed via the cloud active directory. In this case, we use Jumpcloud. We can run scripts remotely to remove and then deploy software. I am trying to remove MS Office so I can deploy our volume licensed edition without any version conflicts.In your place I would dump the OS that comes with a PC/Laptop as most of it has some sort of crap installed in it that can't be cleaned.I don’t know a power shell script for it, but I’ve had good experiences with revo uninstaller for that sort of thing.Hi, If you are looking for a manual cleanup I would recommend using this tool from Microsoft:

Question about Unix software for my class (using Windows),Putty connects you to a server and gives you a text terminal.  Exactly what directory you log in to depends on the server but will generally be your home directory.  Look up tutorials on using linux/*nix terminals for more.WinSCP is like Putty but is used to transfer files from your local PC to the server.

I was really looking forward to a new leg.Why did writing bugs ever become beat practice in the first place? And why is this spec so incredibly slow to get adopted? It would save billions! Maybe we should put some thought into improving the current bug ecosystem, as a stopgap measure, if defects aren't fully deprecated at all shops yet.Yeah, this is some r/thanksiamcured material for softwareFinally as the standard says ""must not"" contain bugs instead of the pre-standard unwritten rule ""should"" contain bugs, that problem is finally solved once and for all!

Reasons for choosing Python for my SaaS software product,"Sure. Best to write me an email. You can find it on my pageThank you so much for taking the time to write this up. It has some extremely useful and practical information for a beginner like me. I've just started learning Python a few weeks ago. One of the reasons was to try and build a (basic) SaaS offering to attract traffic to my site hy offering more value to the visitors. Looking to go the freemium route eventually, but I do realize I have a long journey ahead to get a point where my product has enough value that people might actually pay for using it.Sure 😊Thank you for explaining acronyms like SaaS. I hate it when people throw jargon around and assume that everyone knows.I wonder if the performance gains from python 3.11 will make fully-fledged SaaS platforms viable for the languageMore like the latter. It's how to break the top view down into the technical implementation of that ideas.ThanksGreat story, and congrats!Amazing post thank youI didn’t know about HTMX or Alpine.  They look really interesting!  I’m currently building the backend for my first web app, but I need to get some frontend skills.  I haven’t learned JS yet, and React/Vue/etc look… intimidating.  What would you say are the major drawbacks to HTMX and Alpine?  Anything that you haven’t been able to do?Ooops, thanks for that.I followed your twitter to dinky dash and the example has Christmas over 500 days away!Well, I originally came from Product Management. So that was my job before this project.Are your ideas actual products/festures/use cases, or technical things you'd like to implement and think should have some application.How did you find the process of knowing what you wanted the app to do and converting that into the lines of code?Fully agree 😉Thank you 😊And also having the foresight of scaling issues as well.Pragmatism.

Rejected. How to improve,"never lose heart. when you work hard . one day you will get sucees""Not a good fit."" is often a generic term to brush people off, but it's also used in the way it sounds, to let you know that you were not the KIND of person they thought would be a good fit at their company. My translation of that is, ""You were fine, but they didn't really, really want to work with you. But that's who gets hired.""Even the best developers will get passed over for multiple roles before they find a fit. Don't sweat a single job. Protip send out multiple applications simultaneously, dont rely on one even if its your favorite and you got a call back.Then, follow up enthusiasm by mentioning that people enjoy working with enthusiastic people. They're happier and their quality of work is higher. Manitcor is right, you shouldn't sweat a single job, but I think it might have touched on an insecurity. If that's the case you should figure out if it's holding you back or it doesn't really matter.If I were to give you one piece of advice it would be enthusiasm. People LOVE enthusiastic people. They will build their own stories about you succeeding if they are drawn to you. I had a woman who had given me my first round interview at a company (that made meeting room software) mail me a handwritten note telling me that she fought really hard for me and that I was in the final two. Sure, it could have been smoke, but it doesn't matter because it had details of our interview...she remembered it. She wanted me to work where she worked. We had talked about Greece, after all. I would suggest finding three or four stories and practice telling them over and over with enthusiasm. Get excited about SMALL details. That's the secret. ""I know the alignment on the chatbot was fine, but I thought it would look so much cooler if it all lined up perfectly. And it did!"" These folks making these decisions don't have any kind of real training in this area, they are just going off their intuition. I've scored so many jobs I wasn't highly qualified for because people want to work with me -- not just software, but in the film industry and video editing industry as well. If I can just answer some of the tech stuff correctly they almost always pass me up the chain because, by the end of the meeting, they want me to work there. As a relationship coach and a software developer, I hear this from time to time. The manner in which a particular candidate is chosen is usually as arbitrary as the likes and dislikes of one person at a company who thinks they are choosing 'fairly'. I work at a huge company and personally saw a particular candidate get passed over by a manager after me and that manager interviewed the candidate. Why? The manager thought the candidate was not a top performer. I said, ""That young man is not only the smartest candidate we have interviewed he will likely be one of the sharpest people at this company."" All credit to this great manager because he weighed by opinion and decided it was likely a good assessment. He brought the candidate on to much success. The take away for you: That person did not represent themselves in such a way that the manager felt compelled to bring them on. And that candidate was a fantastic developer.",3,593,0.005059022,0.005059022,1,594,32.93,55.11,40.79,59.87,16.97,17.17,94.28,74.24,60.61,17.85,11.62,4.04,0.51,2.53,1.18,2.86,6.23,15.82,7.58,1.85,12.46,9.6,4.88,7.58,2.53,17.85,5.72,4.38,4.71,0.67,2.69,1.35,17,0.84,15.49,3.2,1.52,2.02,4.04,1.35,4.88,0.17,4.55,3.54,1.01,2.36,2.02,0.34,0.17,0,0,0,15.82,4.04,0.17,0,0.17,0,3.03,10.94,0.17,0,0.84,0.67,1.85,1.18,0,0.67,7.07,0.51,0.17,6.23,0.17,0,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,0.17,0.67,1.35,0.34,0,0,1.18,0.17,0,7.41,7.07,0.17,1.01,4.38,0.34,0.34,0.84,2.53,5.56,4.38,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,14.98,6.57,3.2,0.17,0.17,2.69,2.19,

Sales Widget Question,"Thanks for the input. The issue is that several partner sites are concerned about user migration due to purchasers being (typically) redirected to another site’s payment gateway other than their own. Of course they could always be routed back to the original site upon completion but they also want to control the purchase process using their gateway.Sounds weird. There is a so very little value in this widget without the order processing, that I would not even integrate it.The product featured on the widget would need to be editable (photo, price, description) using a dashboard of some kind to make changes. This would allow for creating different product iterations and pricing. Once the widget is customized with a particular product, a code snippet would be generated which could be sent to the parent sites to embed.Are those the entire requirements?",0,143,0,0,1,143,73.21,16.13,10.44,29.67,23.83,25.17,83.92,63.64,53.15,9.09,3.5,0.7,0,0,0,2.8,5.59,18.18,9.79,0.7,13.29,11.19,6.99,3.5,0.7,16.78,4.9,4.9,4.9,1.4,0.7,2.8,20.98,0.7,20.28,0,4.9,5.59,0.7,1.4,6.99,0,1.4,0.7,0,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.29,2.8,1.4,0.7,0,0,1.4,3.5,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.29,0,0,2.8,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.4,0.7,1.4,0,0.7,0,0,0,1.4,2.1,6.99,0,0,6.29,0,0.7,0,2.8,0.7,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.59,5.59,2.8,0.7,0,0.7,2.8,

Scalable FIFO architecture ? Or something else?,"Only transactions won't work for me.Where do you see performance issues? Have you measured it?You're trying to balance two separate immediate consistency problems: is the item available, and can the user pay for it.Will look into it, thanksDistributed caches, specifically Redis distributed queue is what you might be looking for.Agree with transactions. And kinda agree with the ledger suggestion but I think for performance reasons you may want to ALSO maintain the balances (eg. to be able to quickly answer the question: does user X have enough funds to buy Y).You can use transactions and pessimistic database locks, most SQL databases would have these. Also UserBalance and AvailableItems are usually modeled as ledgers. So you don't really have a UserBalance table, but you have a UserTransaction table, and the sum of amounts would equal the balance.

Software bugs are not trivial,"I've had a couple of minor things (child lock fault,  which affected windows and mirrors). That happened twice early on,  but not for 7 months now.  I have had the ""drive with greater caution"" error once,  but when I started it the next time it was fine.  Android Auto works great in my car.  My first phone did not work as well.  It was Android 9 and I had to use it wired until I put it into Developer mode. However,  my new phone (since the summer) is Android 11 and it works perfectly.  I love my car.  It's my 4th EV and my favorite.Here I was hoping my new Tiguan infotainment might get a patch or two, seems less likely based on this thread if they can’t even steadily update the ID 4.They were promising an update ""soon"" before I bought my car.Have a reservation for an ID.4 and these issues concern me. From what I’ve tried the ID.4 infotainment system seems fine but I haven’t lived with the car yet and these horror stories aren’t making me any more confident. I heard VW NA talking about an update coming soon, I really hope it does, as a VW enthusiast it honestly pisses me off how crap VW treats the US, when it comes it models, software updates, overall service, etc.Software is buggy to bad. I had automatic headlight errors and it was actually broken. Dealer fixed it and dynamic lights work now. Once or twice in five months CarPlay just wouldn’t work. Screen swipes always delayed. Usually, CarPlay is fine and I just use that. Software regarding electricity usage was better on my Chevy. Feedback on battery usage by type (environmental, driving style, etc.) was better on the Chevy. But I love this car. Between my last VW and now I’ve driven a Bolt, Volvo XC-90, and Subaru Crosstrek. This is the first car I have loved since my diesel Jetta.Absolutely. I love using the ACC but when it doesn’t see a car that’s clearly in front of me, its concerning.What would you get if you were to sell it? Another EV?Like they care. We still all got an ID.4 and they have a shit ton of reservations lined up. It sucks and I am thinking about selling my ID.4 since you can get more money for them now. I would definitely feel a lot better if there was a damn update. At least one. Or an email. Something. Cheesitz.Were you stopped when you checked the energy consumption? When you aren't driving it displays consumption in kWhrs/hr instead of mi/kWhr.I still get random little bugs like the one today. Left the office for lunch and the speedometer was in miles per hour like normal, but my battery range was showing in kilometers per hour. When I came back from lunch both were mph again. Just odd. Really need that update soon.Just download the app and play with it, or look at the reviews in the app store and Google play and you'll see how much attention they pay to their software.I haven't experienced any major issues in my 6 months of ownership.  I am very pleased using Apple Carplay.  For the approximately 1st weeks of owning the car, I used the VW nav system & its infotainment but quickly realized using apps in Apple CarPlay was vastly superior, and haven't looked back.It's fine. As I noted in my response to OP, there are definitely software bugs, but I personally don't have any daily ""this is BS"" issues. Some of the bugs effect some individuals consistently (like scheduled charging).I’m currently locked for production, and so will need to make a decision in a few months. How bad is it? Everything I read says that Apply Carplay will suffice. We definitely need good software to manage charging and climate control, but those shouldn’t impact the drive itself toooo much I hope?Can you share the survey link if it's public? Hopefully more complaints might bring OTAs to us faster!Same I got a email asking about everything on my new ID.4. My biggest issue is how it's been a year and Volkswagen still won't communicate with us. It's frustrating and at this point they seem like liars.Ohhh was this the one that asked rank our favorite car-net features, in which NONE of the listed features are included on the ID.4 car-net app? Good times.Same thing slammed them on the software and the lack of OTA updates on the survey.I agree 100%I remember seeing some YouTube reviews of various updates that had been pushed out to ID vehicles... is that happening outside the US only?This more or less mirrors my exact experience (Pro RWD, just over 13K miles as of this writing), with the exception of battery use during precondition - my car pulls power from the wall 100% of the time when in this mode, so it’s just as likely that the EVSE is the culprit for those experiencing this issue. Both automaker and EVSE manufacturer are building to the j1772 standard to enable charging function and there is enough wiggle room for interpretation in the standard where mismatches in edge case handling of preconditioning power requests could result in inconsistencies, degraded performance or the feature just not working at all. If you’re having this issue, try doing it at a friends place who has different charging equipment if you have that option. You may be surprised to find that it “just works,” as it does for me. FWIW I have a “dumb,” 7kW Bosch PowerXpress EVSE.I’ve had a few issues with software, like the infotainment screen stop working, but they were not frequent. Maybe half a dozen issues in 10 months.I echo this sentiment. If you're having repeat or daily issues it's time to get your dealership involved.Your experience isn't consistent with mine. The issues you are having are more than just general software bugs, and I'd encourage you to push your dealer on them.",18,1017,0.017699115,0.017699115,1,1023,24.85,7.24,78.58,51.88,18.6,16.42,86.12,70.58,56.89,16.91,10.17,6.84,0.49,1.66,0,1.08,6.74,15.15,6.06,3.13,10.95,10.17,6.74,7.04,1.66,17.4,6.65,5.18,3.23,0.78,1.47,0.98,14.76,0.98,13.69,1.76,2.35,2.64,3.52,0.98,4.69,0.1,4.99,3.23,1.17,2.15,1.27,0.68,0.1,0.39,0,0.68,6.45,2.83,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.2,1.47,3.71,0,0.1,0,0,3.42,0.39,0,3.03,2.64,0.29,0.2,1.66,0.49,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0.49,0.39,0.88,0.29,0.2,0,0.1,0.1,0.2,6.16,7.33,0.49,1.56,4.4,0.78,0.2,0.1,5.87,4.69,5.38,1.47,0.49,0.29,0.2,0.1,0,17.5,7.43,3.52,0.78,0.1,2.83,2.83,

Spam email help??,"What I have done for years is have multiple emails. One for my main important stuff that I rarely share, and 2-3 emails for random shit I sign up for on websites because they WILL share your email out. You can also use a 10 minute email for anything you know you won’t use again or care for.The reason this happens is because your email is an a list to get sent these emails by possible bad actors.  They get their email and setup a free domain they can use to spoof legitimate email addresses using scripts in a command line and then the address and reply address look legit but the email header and route will be different every time.  This makes it impossible to permanently block these types of spam emails even if marked as spam.  There are a couple of ways to deal with this, you can have all emails autoblocked until you mark it as legitimate, this is the solution most business use that I have seen.  Anything without an internal domain goes to spam and you recieve a notification that an email from the send has been blocked and you can either release it as safe after viewing the header or mark it as spam.I mean there is nothing really that you can do. Your address is out there and spammers can just keep making new email addresses to spam you with. I would go with the stricter setting and whitelist any important emails if you can",3,254,0.011811024,0.011811024,1,254,29.61,67.71,17.6,63.64,28.22,14.57,87.01,74.02,59.06,16.54,9.45,2.76,0,5.12,0,1.57,7.09,14.57,6.3,1.18,12.2,10.63,4.33,9.84,0.79,18.5,7.09,3.15,2.76,0.79,0.39,1.57,15.35,1.18,14.17,1.18,3.94,3.15,3.54,0.39,3.54,0,3.94,3.15,0.39,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,0.39,14.57,7.48,0.39,0,0,0,5.91,7.09,0,0,0,0,5.91,0,0,5.91,1.18,0.39,0,0.79,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,0,0,0,0.39,0,5.91,5.91,0.39,0.79,4.33,1.18,0,0,3.54,1.57,7.48,1.18,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,5.91,3.94,1.18,0,0,0.39,0.39,
Spirits surrounding my Dad 24 hrs before his death. I was in my father's hospital room. The room was Brightly lit and it was just the two of us. The red dot on his forehead is a thermometer which was the only technology he was attached to. June 2018,"My sister had gone to the bank to make a deposit for our dad. She left and I came to the same bank to make a deposit as well. The bank manager, Diane, who our family  knew for 20 years, called me into her office so she could have a private conversation When my mom died, she made her presence known. My youngest sister and I were reeling from grief,  and overwhelmed taking care of our heartbroken dad who lost his wife, and was dealing with a recent leg amputation.  About 2 weeks after she died, I was sobbing so uncontrollably over her death, I couldn't be consoled. It was late at night and only my husband and I were home. It was around midnight and we were in bed. My husband was trying to comfort me when all of a sudden,  we both heard someone loudly knocking on our closed bedroom door. My husband got up and opened the door expecting it to be our son who might have come home early from a football game. No one was there. And our son wasn't home. Even more to our surprise, all of the downstairs lights were on. We had turned them all off prior going to bed. My husband and I looked at each and then we both started to smell the air. We both smellled Chanel No 5, my mom's favorite perfume.  We knew she was with us and trying to reassure me she wasn't 'gone'..She was just in a different realm. A few days later, she made another appearance, this time towards my sister. with me.  Once the door was shut, she told me, ""You're not going to believe this, and you'll think I am crazy. You just missed your sister, she was here making a deposit. While I was helping her, I looked up and I could clearly see your mom standing next to your sister. She was on her tip-toes looking over your sister's shoulder while she was filling out the deposit slip. Your mom was radiant and smiling! She had her glorious hair back! She was no longer bald from the chemo. She would smile at your sister, then she looked at me and smiled! Your mom was wearing this really cute lavender pantsuit with this gorgeous necklace and matching earrings."" The outfit Diane described my mom wearing was an outfit I bought her a few months before she died. My mom loved this outfit. Sadly,  she had only been able to wear it once. Seeing she was wearing it after she died, gave me comfort. Diane went on to say, ""Do you believe me? I told Daine I did believe her.  Diane was native American. She had a no-nonsense attitude, and was very professional. I could tell she was embarrassed to tell me, but I was so happy she did. ""Reenie, your mom wants both you and your sister to know she is happy and looking over you girls and your dad"". Our dad died in hospice. We were at his bedside, and our dad was in and out of consciousness.  When he was awake, he kept telling both me, my sister and my husband, how frightened he was of dying.  That he didn't want die. Around six in the evening as the sun was started to slip away for the night, our dad suddenly woke up and looked intently over my husband's shoulder. My dad's eyes opened in utter amazement and he lifted his arm and stretched his hand out, as if he was reaching out to touch someone that was standing behind my husband chair. My husband and I watched what my dad was doing. My husband leaned over and whispered into my ear, ""who is your dad staring at?"" I leaned forward in my chair and looked in the direction of my dad's outstretched arm. All of a sudden I could feel this intense energy  shift in the room. There was a.stunning  golden glow in the room and  I could clearly see the silhouette shapes of two people standing behind my husband. One figure was taller, the other, much shorter. I couldn't make out if these beings were male or female. But I intrinsically knew, those beings were my brother who died six months prior, and our mom. They were there to help our dad pass over. I looked back at my dad. My dad set his arm back to his side, and he had the biggest grin on his face!  I asked  my husband and sister if they could leave the room for a few minutes to give me some alone time with dad. Once they left, I leaned over to my dad and asked him what he saw. He excitedly told me, ""Reenie! I saw your mom and brother! They are waiting for me and your mom told me all of our friends and family, including my beloved pets who died, are happy I am coming to join them soon! ""  ""Dad, are you still afraid of dying?"" ""Not anymore. I know there is an afterlife and my loved ones are there.  I will miss my girls, but I am tired and I don't like being without your mom or brother."" My family walked back into the room, and our dad  said his goodbyes to all of us;  he said how much he loved us, and he thanked us for being such a loving family.  He drifted off a few moments later, and he  took his last breath, an hour later. I could tell you other personal stories of other heavenly visits, but it is late and I am drifting off to sleep. I will  pray for comfort and peace in your remaining days. Life is beautiful, and the beyond, even more so.",2,965,0.002072539,0.002072539,1,966,18.12,94.89,53.73,53.96,14.21,13.56,95.45,76.19,60.77,22.46,20.19,8.18,2.59,2.38,5.8,0.62,2.28,17.18,4.24,1.04,11.7,9.11,4.35,7.45,1.14,19.77,5.28,4.14,9.42,9.01,0.31,0.1,7.45,1.04,6.42,1.45,0.83,1.45,0.83,0.41,2.17,0,4.76,3.31,1.14,2.9,1.66,0.93,0.31,0,0.41,0,23.29,3.93,0.62,0.21,0,0,2.17,19.05,6.11,0.1,6,6,0.21,0,0.21,0,2.8,0.21,1.14,0.72,0.83,0.21,3.42,0.31,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,1.24,0,0.21,0.41,0,0,0.1,0,0,0.21,4.24,12.32,0.62,1.55,7.97,2.28,0.41,0.21,4.55,11.49,1.86,1.24,0,0,0,0,0,15.73,6.31,5.18,0.31,0.72,1.55,1.66,

He was receiving comfort care at home and a few days before he passed he was waving at people on the ceiling. I asked him who he was waving and talking to and he smiled and said he was seeing a lot of old friends and family. He was quite jolly about it When my father passed my mother wanted the priest to come while some family was still a few hours away. While the priest was praying over my father I almost cried out to stop, he was still breathing. The best way to describe it was I saw his soul leaving his body. My father was a very devout Roman Catholic and I believed he waited for the priest. I was not the only one in the room who had the same reaction. I felt great peace and my dad visited me in a dream a few days after later. When my dad was happy had a way of walking that was half dance and half walk. He had been ill for a while and couldn't walk without his walker. In my dream he walked up in his happy dance walk with a huge smile on his face. We were in what looked like Downtown Disneyland. He came up to my family and myself and was happily chatting. I couldn't get over happy and healthy he looked. I never remember my dreams. I believe he was telling me he was fine.

My Great Aunt told my cousin that her mother, sister (my grandma) and all her brothers were there. She started talking to them and it brought her great peace in her last day.  The hospice nurses told us this happens all the time. Then several years later I saw this phenomenon highlighted in the documentary series Surviving Death by Leslie Kean. My whole family talked about it because we didn’t realize just how prevalent it is.

"Study: Tesla, Jaguar among highest in auto software defects","No dataElectric cars have 0 appeal to meAs a software developer, blame the managers that refuse to hire testers.I hate the ""oh we'll just make another patch"" attitude of software devs.  In my experience most of the down time EE's and ME's experience is due to the software team trying to get their shit together...  OEM manufacturer software is NOT allowed to perform functional safety in industrial machinery and you need a Safety PLC for complex systems.  You are a fool if you trust software, maybe a dead fool someday.  I have been assured many times by software guys that the software won't let you enable that RF generator, gantry, 10KW laser, etc... if the door is open.  Anyways...rant over.  I spent too much time today telling another engineer software was an unacceptable safety measure...Which is the #1 issue in all software companies. The ability to push updates generally leads to a more lax testing cycle to meet harsh deadlines. It takes a lot of work and discipline to stick with solid testing before pushing stuff.Perhaps, but Tesla can distribute fixes over the air.The new jagaur software is actually pretty fantasticThis is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 76%. (I'm a bot)It's much improved.  Telsa's business and engineering model is similar to the computer games industry.  Release a pre-beta as final product and upgrade and patch as you go along.  Let your user base be your testers and have them error report to your engineers and then force updates via wireless link over-night.I owned a volvo s40 02. ABS modules are shit, service guides everywhere tell you you need to remove the module and bleed the brakes (you dont, just need skinny hands). Ride was shit. Noise isolation was shit.It's not really surprising that the companies implementing the biggest touchscreens with the most software features would also be the ones with the most glitches.I never understood reddits fascination with Volvo. Not that theyre bad cars or anything, just boring. Sure they make the polestar, but the v60 is over 60k, weighs nearly 4,000 lbs, and makes 345hp.. its great that its a wagon, but there's still lots of faster cars for that price.Implying anyone is thinking about VolvoNo dataNo dataNo dataSoftware is always evolving... they will get better with time and the passion they have, I believe in Tesla & Elon ! (Jaguar too) :Phow is chevy in the top and not bmw?Being in IT security, this shit really scares me.On what earth? The 2015 F Type's infotainment was so slow and the navigation is dreadful. Mazda 3 rental i got from Hertz for work is so much betterIs there any stats that show the difference in the amount of defects between Tesla and the rest?Waiting for Reddit to mention Volvo being part of that list. Just kidding, that would mean that Reddit wrote something negative about VolvoThis is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 76%. (I'm a bot)Nah..they are just being BritishJag's isn't defective , it's just rocking the 90s tech.Looks like it was based on consumer complaints.  If they're anything like the ""complaints"" on the NHTSA site about Tesla, they're not even from Tesla owners.iPhone has more software bugs than Nokia 3310. Fact of life.Why is it that in this sub, whenever Tesla comes out on top of some survey or report, it is a sure sign they are taking over the industry, but when Tesla does poorly in a survey or report, surely the methodology is flawed?Tesla just has a lot of bugs. Owners tend to let it fly a lot more because ""maybe they'll fix it in the next update""I am sure the methodology they used to put tesla near the top was flawed. Tesla fixes problems unlike most other manufacturers and Tesla also uses more software visible to the customer.BRB going to write a new investment hit piece saying Tesla is Bankrupt because of their OTA update system being broke and how GM is the next big investment!well in all your previous cars i doubt you had 1/10 of the features listedGreat analogy. I've never had any issues with my 3 series and software updates because...it didn't have any. 100% success or 0%?

Você pode modificar o kernel na mesma hora em que detectou o problema, e ainda por cima se privilegiar de patches que outras pessoas farão, exatamente por que o codigo fonte do sistema esta disponível. Um outro ponto super importante pra mitigar esses problemas que só um OS com codigo aberto possibilita, são os ""builds reproduzíves"". Se cria uma código que mapeia o codigo fonte ao binario produzido, de uma forma que se voce compilar o mesmo fonte, o binário sairá exatamente igual, e esse codigo irá bater exatamente com o binário (pronto) que voce baixou de terceiros. Já com codigo fechado, voce nao tem como saber sequer se já não tem um backdoor colocado pelo proprio fabricante, por que nao existe transparencia alguma nesse processo. Assim voce pode ter um codigo fonte que sabe que é confiável, que foi visto e analisado por muitas pessoas de vários lugares, e saber que o que esta rodando bate exatamente com aquele codigo fonte seguro.Então....

"TIL Dennis Ritchie who invented the C programming language, co-created the Unix operating system, and is largely regarded as influencing a part of effectively every software system we use on a daily basis died 1 week after Steve Jobs. Due to this, his death was largely overshadowed and ignored.","It looks like he was never married?I just let a tear fall gently on my second edition of the book ...Just kidding, I just looked at char (*(*x[3])())[5] again and cursed him.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie#DeathRitchie was found dead on October 12, 2011, at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone. First news of his death came from his former colleague, Rob Pike. The cause and exact time of death have not been disclosed. He had been in frail health for several years following treatment for prostate cancer and heart disease. News of Ritchie's death was largely overshadowed by the media coverage of the death of Apple founder Steve Jobs, which occurred the week before.Also:Following Ritchie's death, computer historian Paul E. Ceruzzi stated:Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name at all, but... if you had a microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside.In an interview shortly after Ritchie's death, long time colleague Brian Kernighan said Ritchie never expected C to be so significant. Kernighan told The New York Times ""The tools that Dennis built—and their direct descendants—run pretty much everything today.” Kernighan reminded readers of how important a role C and Unix had played in the development of later high-profile projects, such as the iPhone. Other testimonials to his influence followed.At his death, a commentator compared the relative importance of Steve Jobs and Ritchie, concluding that ""[Ritchie's] work played a key role in spawning the technological revolution of the last forty years—including technology on which Apple went on to build its fortune."" Another commentator said, ""Ritchie, on the other hand, invented and co-invented two key software technologies which make up the DNA of effectively every single computer software product we use directly or even indirectly in the modern age. It sounds like a wild claim, but it really is true."" Another said, ""many in computer science and related fields knew of Ritchie’s importance to the growth and development of, well, everything to do with computing,...""The Fedora 16 Linux distribution, which was released about a month after he died, was dedicated to his memory. FreeBSD 9.0, released January 12, 2012 was also dedicated in his memory.My friend at Princeton called me up one day and was like: ""hey, you know that guy who wrote the book you really like? The C one? Yeah one of the authors is my professor this quarter."" I might have killed him out of jealousy but he got me a signed copy of K&R. :)Fuck yes my friend.There’ll be a movie about them one dayFoundation? I use C every day at work. It’s the language used for programming micro controllers and I can’t see that changing soon!I have K&R on my bookshelf at work.Kind of symbolic how most programmers are treated at non-tech companies.I am a CS student in NJ and if you asked me who invented C I wouldn’t have had the answer.That makes them, by definition, some of the most influential people of all time. And I'd never heard their name until just now. (despite knowing some c++ and programming and being generally not too bad with tech stuff)They are also the authors of one of the most famous computing books ever: K&R C.Ken Thompson is another name that should be mentioned alongside Ritchie and Kernighan in being one of the Bell Labs Unix guys and instrumental in what we have today. Thompson was also involved in the design of the Go programming language at Google.Big thread on Slashdot when Ritchie passed away.I don't see it as strange that they weren't better known by the general population. Most couldn't tell you who created the Android OS, who Apple's head designer is, or who made the first automobile.If only. Bell labs has contributed an incredibly huge amount to science, the transistor alone would put any team on the front page of science but Bell labs also came up with C, Unix, radio astronomy, the god damn laser, need I go on? Of course it wasn't just one person but I don't know of another institution that propelled humanity like Bell labs.Ritchie and Kernighan (and the rest of the Bell Labs guys) are almost unknown to the public, despite creating the basis for modern programming and developing the foundations for all the software we use today. At least in the Computer Science community they are known and respected.Edit: Wow, I'm glad this got a lot of attention! Their book is one of my favorites and has huge sentimental value to me.

"TIL that Nike created a pair of shoes that were so advanced, they were banned from the Olympics because they were considered as technological doping.The Alphaflys, or “the shoe that broke running”, as sports scientist Dr Ross Tuckercalled them, contain tech designed to deliver greater energy return","Kipchoge is a freak of nature. I wonder if the sub 2 hour could happen with any other runnersDo these translate to just comfort for normal walking around? My feet hurt and I hate shoes.Just an addition, with breaking 2, he didnt break sub 2 hours with the vapourfly 4%. He ended up breaking it in the Ineos 159 Challenge (essentially breaking 2 part 2) where nike essentially upgraded the shoe into the alpha fly next %, wearing that shoe under the Ineos 159 challenge, he broke 2.TIL. No wonder that pair of Trail Gloves I just bought it so unlike the ones I wore 10 years ago.Breakin 2: Shoe Technology BoogalooSo was “Born to Run” wrong about minimalist shoes? It was a fantastic, very entertaining book, but I always wondered if the science continued to back up its claimsThis reminds me of the controversy in golf equipment. So much R&D have gone into golf balls and clubs that it has required courses to modify to try and keep them still competitive. One course made in the 80s is famous for being a 3-5 stroke course because there is a line of trees in the way and you have to snake around them. Someone decided to just shoot over the trees and was able to beat the course in two strokes. They now furthered the starting spot and added more trees to discourage people from doing that. The better equipment has made distance and accuracy go way up and has even made controlling the ball for putting easier. Modern day Amateurs can be considered pros from the 70s.I went and watched the Olympic marathon trials in February 2020 and I believe 9 of the top ten runners had the Nike ""cheaterflies"". Athletes sponsored by other companies (Adidas, Mizuno, etc) allowed their athletes to run in the Nike shoes with the Nike logo taped over because their competitive products weren't ready yet, and they knew their athletes had the best chance at qualifying if they wore the NikesYou are slightly confusing the two attempts. On the first attempt, wearing vaporflys, he failed. On the second attempt wearing alphaflys (with all pacers wearing vaporflys) he succeeded. Everyone flocked to get the vaporflys after his first attempt where he failed.That would explain why I can't find super thin tiny shoes anymore. I loved the style of the shoe barely being there 😔Adidas went ahead and released a shoe with illegal stack height over 40 mm anyway, which led to some unfortunate DQs.They also limited the number of carbon plates allowed to just 1 (one). The best shoes Nike had, which were used for breaking the 2 hour barrier, had 3 carbon plates in it. The reason I mention it is because of your insinuation that they just set the guidelines to fit exactly with the shoes Nike had. That's not accurate.The running shoe market is insane. The ASICS Metaspeed Sky+/Edge+ and Nike’s Alphafly 2 sell out the minute more of them become available. Shoutout to r/runningshoegeeks for emptying my wallet every couple of monthsAround the time of the ""Breaking 2"" experiment where Nike pulled out all the stops to see if an athlete could break the 2 hour marathon barrier, there was a huge leap in shoe R&D and Nike developed a new style of running shoe that utilized a carbon plate and super light, high energy return foam that supposedly increased running efficiency by 4% (hence the name Vaporfly 4%).  Eluid Kipchoge did end up breaking the 2 hour barrier (in a tightly controlled environment using some advantages that disqualified it from being an official record but he was still the first human to run the distance under 2 hours).  Immediately after the shoe became commercially available, nearly every elite runner and a lot of amateurs too were wearing Vaporflys. It set off a flurry of new advancements in shoe technology as other brands tried to reclaim their piece of the market.  We've seen a huge shift away from minimalist racing shoes that were all the rage since Born to Run was published and became a sensation in the 2000s.  Now most competition shoes utilize the carbon plate and ever increasing amounts of kinetic foam. Of course, this all came with controversy as people worried that the technology advancements were happening too fast, that it gave certain athletes who had access to non-commercially available ""supershoes"" an unfair advantage, so the committee responsible for international running regulations put some guidelines in place.  The main one being limits on the ""stack height"", or amount of foam cushioning a shoe was allowed to have.  I believe the limit is now 40mm, which conveniently was exactly the height of Nike's most advanced racing shoe on the market at the time.",16,807,0.019826518,0.019826518,1,804,85.92,35.09,44.91,26.76,26.8,20.65,80.35,64.93,49.25,8.46,4.73,1.74,0.12,0.25,1,1.49,3.73,16.42,9.7,4.85,13.06,5.85,5.47,4.73,0.62,13.43,6.72,6.59,4.1,0.25,2.24,2.24,10.32,1.24,9.08,1.49,2.74,0.87,1.99,0.5,2.36,0.12,3.48,1.99,1.49,1.24,0.5,0.75,0.12,0.25,0.12,0,5.1,1.62,0,0,0.12,0.37,0.37,3.48,0,0,0,1,0.37,0,0,0.37,2.86,1.24,0,1,0.75,0,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.37,0,0.37,0,0,0,0.37,0,0.5,4.35,10.2,0.12,2.86,6.59,0.5,0,0.37,4.23,6.72,1.99,0.37,0.5,0.37,0,0.12,0,12.44,4.35,2.74,0.25,0,0.75,4.35,
TIL that software bugs in a radiation therapy machine were responsible for killing 3 people with high doses of radiation,"My Mom just had this done, i’m horrifiedEarlier versions did, but the Therac-25 wanted to rely on its new digital programming only. They removed a lot of manual failsafes and didn’t bother to figure out when the program overloaded.I don’t know anything about these machines, but surely they’d be equipped with a physical mechanism to prevent lethal doses from being possible without an override, one would think.You don't want to get the 4th patient angry.We just learned about this last semester. Its a problem in which several threads are running at the same time, accessing a portion of the memory as they work. If everything goes as intended, you get a certain amount of radiation, but sometimes it fucks up. The threads are accessing the memory/variable that is used for calculations in the wrong order, resulting in an awfully wrong number, and a dose of radiation many many times higher than the intended dose.There are software ways to limit the risks as well if hard-coded options are not viable. Typically if I am designing a system with life safety risks, the absolutely first thing I will do is create output 'filters' that will basically interlock any risky condition on the finial output regardless of faulty code. That takes alot of critical thinking. All the parameters within here are hard coded. Once that is done and tested a dozen different ways then that module never gets touched without going thru the entire testing process again. If necessary, that code can be password protected.This is why industrial machinery safety standards don't allow you to consider that your machine software will protect the operator or not close a door on someone. Legitimate hardware safety interlocks are required.  Software guys hate being told I treat their software as of it is malicious.HUMANS REQUIRE ICE CREAMIt was early version of AI become sentient.

The article just says that he presented his findings and got suspended, but did he directly show his findings for the bug bounty to blackboard or whatever agency they go through? Or did he go into his interactions with them more?Also, getting punished for trying to do the right thing and help out just makes hording the information and maybe selling it to someone else more appealing.And this is why cyber security is so hard to get into. Not that it isn't hard to understand all the topics required to be competent, but that it is also often such a thankless job.Being smart doesn't make everything right. Just makes things possible.Doesn’t even know what opsec is when hacking define smart lolIt sounded like he disclosed information about the security flaws responsibly too.The good news is this is better than things were when I was his age. The school would still suck, but at least the vendors now kind of ""get it"", and (mostly) are appreciative for responsible disclosure. When I was his age and found this stuff, I would keep it to myself because otherwise the school would kick you out, the cops would get called, and if you ruffled the feathers of the wrong vendor, you might find the FBI up your ass with an electron microscope.There is no greater crime than revealing the hypocrisy of the aristocracy.Schools will sooner push the issue under the rug than actually do anything.Punished for being smart.We used Blackboard in my college. A professor was logged in and had her browser window open on the projector. There was a HTTP GET value in the URL that contained her session ID. I copied the session ID, typed it into my browser, and gained full access to the professor’s account. Anything she could do on Blackboard, I could do as well.I never abused this, and I informed the professor, advising her to use F11 to full screen the browser so the URL bar wasn’t visible.Blackboard was a horrible mess.What’s truly terrifying is Google classroom. Would love to read one of those contracts.I also want to point out that not only is the education not there but the money isn't there either. These types of solutions exist because anything better is to expensive.Exactly.  Educational IT departments struggle to retain good help because they're simply unable to keep up with market rate for wages.  So they often turn into turnstiles for local graduates ""good at computers"" before taking off after 2-3 years after they've got their training and can get higher wages elsewhere.Having worked for Blackboard I can attest this - they've been numerously warned by sec audits and researchers, yet their code base remains awful. It's all java code from 1998 under the covers.This is bewildering. Does FERPA not carry the same weight as HIPPA, or am I misinformed?I kinda think it’s stupid for someone to be expelled for this, like if they go on the teachers computer and look at grades, sure, but to hack their way into the school system, first off, they should see if he could patch any of their holes, and secondly, to do that in highschool means he is something of a tech prodigy, and if he succeeded in life and became famous in technology, his school could get some recognition (although obviously, college would get more, but still)How did he end up getting caught?A friend of mine did something like this, he’d just get access to tests in advance. He got expelled immediately, luckily didn’t get in any legal trouble.I outsmarted you, and you'll never forgive me for that.",10,971,0.010298661,0.010298661,1,973,32.33,45.53,22.61,41.45,30.41,18.4,90.03,73.28,58.17,15.01,8.84,2.77,0.1,1.54,2.47,1.95,6.17,13.26,6.37,0.92,13.26,11.1,6.68,7.4,2.06,21.17,5.76,2.47,3.6,0.72,1.34,1.64,16.96,1.23,15.72,2.88,2.36,3.29,4.01,0.72,3.91,0.1,5.55,3.39,1.95,1.44,0.92,0.31,0.1,0,0,0.1,12.33,4.32,1.03,0.31,0,0.51,1.64,8.12,0,0,0.41,2.16,2.16,0.1,0,2.06,7.4,0.51,0.31,6.06,0.92,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.31,0.31,2.06,0.31,0.31,0,0.21,0.72,0.1,6.78,8.74,0.62,1.23,6.06,0.82,0.1,0.21,2.88,4.73,5.34,0.82,0.31,0.31,0,0,0,15.52,6.47,4.21,0.72,0,2.06,2.06,
Terrence Howard trying to scam the people of Uganda with his new technology,"I've got a Terrence Howard story, though this will be buried at this point.  I was a volunteer at Sundance Film Festival in 2005, and he was there promoting Hustle and Flow.  Me and my buddy were outside in the snow, and he came out by himself during the premier to smoke a cigarette.  Wasn't really famous at the time, so we really didn't care or think much of it.  As we all stood there in silence, he takes a puff of his cigarette, and says, ""10 years in the game, and they finally let you play.""  Tossed it, and walked back inside.  We were like...okay man, very cool I guess, lol.Dude was replaced as war machine because he’s a nutter lolHe got shafted as Rhoadie in Marvel in part because of how crazy he isI knew he was crazy from the wet wipes stories.  I just didn't know he was a total fucking moron on top of itRight? I thought he was just a mediocre actor, turns out he's a stupid mediocre actor.He's always been this way.  Just a hustler.  Plenty of info online. Hollywood isn't a vetting program, just the opposite.  Often the more f'ed up you are the better an actor you make.Just in case you didn't know, Terrence Howard believes that 1x1=2bro look up some of the shit he said after Iron Man. Specifically what he said about Downey JR. and Marvel etc. This guy is an actual smooth brain and narcissist edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_b50eY0Tt4 warning: extreme cringe from not only Howard but hosts as well. he accuses RDJ of stealing money from him too, taking his cut, forcing him out of MCU etc. psychoWe're talking about a guy who says he left college because his professors wouldn't admit the ""truth"" that 1 x 1 = 2.He was always was crazy Edit, he was on a path of being a successful actor, so the system protected us from his craziness. Now that he’s not a popular actor anymore, there’s no one there to protect us from his craziness. Look at Ezra Miller, he’s been crazy his entire life, but now that he’s not marketable all his protection is gone. And we’re getting exposed to the real person. Edit2- we should realize that the same system that protects him to exploit him for money, is the same system that removes that protection and then exploits him for drama and clicks. When the studios paying for his protection, everything is great and amazing and when the studio stops paying to promote him, they’re making money off their media and social outlets posting his crazy exploits. He’s just a tool for money. Don’t get suckered into one way or the other.Well if he’s crazy then you’re crazy. Because if anyone is crazy then through the connectedness of the universe we all will be crazy together. Let’s say you have an orange and I have an apple. WE have every apple and orange that ever existed or whatever.I met Terrence Howard about 10 years ago at a place I worked in NYC.  The sales part of the transaction takes about 15 minutes and another 10 minutes if they are purchasing the product.  Some of my co-workers were starstruck and freaked out when he came in and since I didn’t really know who he was, I said I would handle the interaction.  Within two minutes of the start of the tour, he begins talking to me about all kinds of crazy shit.  He asked me if I knew what string theory was, and having been passionate about physics during my high school and college years, I told him I knew a little.  He then proceeds to tell me that he’s “solved string theory” and that it was really “simple”.  He goes on about how he was picking up where Albert Einstein left off on general relativity.  He then tells me about how his close friend won a Nobel prize in physics and how the two of them were working on a cure for cancer using only sound waves. It was so incredibly difficult to get this guy to stop talking and refocus him on the reason he walked into my workplace to begin with.  Living in New York exposes one to all kinds of crazy shit, but this was up there.  I’m probably already forgetting about some of the other insane shit he told me, some rambling about triangles too, but this went on for almost the entire 25 minutes, even when I’m just trying to get him to fill out the paperwork and sign all the documents.  Insane.He's been out of the spotlight for a while, but it always comes out again. Another fun fact is that his father stabbed a man to death while waiting in line with 2 year old Terry to see Santa Claus. Apparently the guy accused them of cutting. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Line_SlayingDude doesn't believe in the number zero. Let that sink in. He says zero is not real.How am I only just now learning that this guy is a crazy person?He's basically just taking the line that they kicked him out of the MCU so he'll just make his own Wakanda.Dude is so but hurt about being cut from the MCU that he's out there trying to become a real life Black Panther!His dad killed my uncle in cold blood in front of my cousins while they waited in line to see santa at the mall ""Santa Line Slaying - Wikipedia"" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Line_SlayingI like how he uses ”cleaning the ocean from plastics” as an argument to why they should build it i Uganda, which is landlocked..

Thinking you have defeated capitalism by not upgrading your phone and going SIM only. Then your apps stop working due to not having the latest IOS software.,"‘All the way back’ there’s nothing wrong with my 5s and I’ve been forced to upgrade at a cost of hundreds of £s so I can continue to use my smart devices!What iphone do you have? Apple are actually pretty decent about having iOS updates available to older phones 15 is available all the way back to the 6sKinda.. iOS has traditionally kept OS &  security updates going years after android. AFAIK android have only recently caught up and it’s only for flagship phones initially, though I expect it’ll trickle down to the cheaper ones. After your manufacturer or network stoped giving them to you you, you’ve had to go to aftermarket ROMS, which again is fairly hit and miss depending on which phone you have. It’s good there’s a custom rom scene supporting older phones, but I don’t give google nor the phone makers any real credit for that. Currently apple are providing security and OS updates going back 7 years, which, sadly is the best any manufacturer or OS maker is doing.Solve this issue by going android.I have a 6s and have recently updated the OS and my apps seem to still be okay, I don’t know how much longer they will support it though!I’m on the iPhone 6 so probably not long unfortunatelyiPhone 6 so looks like I’ve just missed the cut!

Trade School Style Software Coding Options?,"What I was thinking about is maybe just going for a business degree and then doing the coding bootcamp as an option.Bootcamps are so new (earliest 2012) that the research on this is only JUST coming out. You're right that in general college programs increase earning potential. However, it's less relevant in tech, and there are whole movements now where tech giants are pivoting away from requiring degrees. Google for example now has a certificate program that they'll count as a degree equivalent (https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-launches-career-certificates-for-high-demand-fields/378396/#close). Slightly more than 1/3 of bootcamp graduates have less than a bachelor's degree, so there's a substantial amount of people with no degree going into tech this way. And if people perform well, someone's background becomes less relevant. A 2017 study by indeed.com  showed that 84% of 1000 employers surveyed found bootcamp graduates as good or better at their jobs than CS grads (https://www.indeed.com/lead/what-employers-think-about-coding-bootcamp). Regarding salary, the average bootcamp graduate would earn $66,964 as an entry-level dev while an average CS graduate would earn $70,700, so that's only a $3,736 difference. The bootcamp grad actually seriously comes out ahead because they're not paying the average $20,770/year for a public school or $46,950/year for a private school plus student loan interest. Most students take longer than 4 years to graduate as well, so costs really pile up. Additionally, if someone is in school full time then they miss those years making a salary. Bootcamps are increasingly a good deal considering  41% of recent college grads are underemployed (https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/02/18/41-recent-grads-work-jobs-not-requiring-degree#:~:text=The%20unemployment%20rate%20for%20young,new%20data%20from%20the%20Federal). COVID has really changed how we as a society view education. Freshman year enrollment, which has been declining for the better part of the last decade, was down 13% this year which is insane.  I seriously think trade programs are going to increase going forward as a result. There's even a huge push to increase tech apprenticeship programs that help people without college degrees (this report is an example https://nycfuture.org/research/expanding-tech-apprenticeships-in-new-york-city). Financially, people in tech without degrees will be fine. The path can be harder, though because changing careers may get tricky in the future. And of course, there's no guarantee of success coming out of any program. The gamble with skipping a bachelor's to do a bootcamp is that the bootcamp needs to lead to a coding job. Stats say there's an 86% chance of that happening, but that's still not a guarantee. What I was thinking about is maybe just going for a business degree and then doing the coding bootcamp as an option.II'm of the widespread opinion that a professional software developer should have a professional's four-year degree, but the major doesn't have to be in computer science at all (almost half of developers didn't major in CS.) f you're in college there's no particular reason you want to drop out - it means a difference in millions of dollars over the course of your career - but there's no reason you shouldn't look at alternate majors. The life sciences, perhaps? Diseases are pretty important these days.Any good suggestions that has a high chance of leading to employment?Bootcamp.Mainly just the lack of curriculum focus and time frame it will take me to complete. I mainly am just wanting to go the fastest way possible into the workforce.

"Troubleshooting tips requested: How can WI-FI CALLING from my home be WORSE THAN than only 1 or 2 BARS of 4G LTE, when I have a strong internet connection and gaming router? I live near an airport, could this be part of the issue? Thank you in advance (2 iPhones: 7 & 8, up to date ios software).","I have this issue, as well.  Verizon WiFi calling induces an audible, repetitive pop/click into the audio stream.  I am using the Verizon provided router with stock settings and an iPhone 11 Pro Max.  Range is not an issue.  The problem occurs anywhere in the house, even with all speed testing from the phone itself showing full speed, jitterless wireless connectivity via the 5 GHz spectrum.Are you in a house or an apartment complex?  How many devices do you have connected to your WiFi router?What do you mean strong internet signal from a gaming router?I'm curious, are you actually having problems with your normal voice calls? Dropping cutting out etc. Or do you just want to use Wi-Fi? Verizon VoLTE is actually pretty capable of dealing with low signal situations. Very good technology behind that but I mean obviously if it's too low nothing can be done except for Wi-Fi or extender. Extenders are great actually, perfect calls and better battery life.LOL. Not funny to you and me, but funny due to its ridiculousness.For what it's worth I just went through this about 5 months ago, my phone will not switch from cell to Wi-Fi calling and if it does manage to make the switch without dropping the call this sound is kind of robotic on both ends I've tried 5 g 2.4 reset all of my connection settings to default. Verizon customer service claims it is a Samsung problem for my phone and then Apple problem for my wife's phone, so I started with Samsung and they said it was a Verizon problem after several hours in one conference call with Samsung customer service in Verizon customer service at the same time they came to the conclusion that it was a spectrum problem LOL.Your router needs to be good at passing IPSec traffic, and doing so reliably. Wi-Fi Calling is sent over an IPSec (think: VPN) tunnel to encrypt it, and to provide some other services like MMS and SMS which would normally be handled by the LTE network.Have noticed the same thing with poor wifi calls. I have fiber optic internet and make calls ten feet from my router and still bad.Have you tried 5Ghz wifi channel? What ISP do you have? I know that really doesn't matter, but ours has been intermittent recently.This is definitely worth a shot.
I thought I tried this before, but I want to give it another shot because it makes perfect sense, despite being pretty ridiculous on the part, I assume, of Apple's ios software.Put your phone into airplane mode then turn on wifi. The phone will  try to keep the phone calls over the cellular network as much as possible so you're likely tetering between the network signal threshold. If you turn off the cellular network and turn wifi in this eliminates that internal battleFrankly, every iphone I have owned on verizon has had horrendous wi-fi calling. If others are not having the issue, I'd love to know the exact technical difference as to why :)It’s odd that I can across this.  My wife has been complaining that calls at home are bad.  We came from T-Mobile about 4 months ago and never had an issue with T-Mobile WiFi calling.  I can’t say I’ve noticed a difference but I’m at work during the day now while my wife is working from home.  I have gig internet and I don’t live near an airport.  She uses an iPhone XR.  I have an iPhone 8.Yes.When you are at home does it actually say “VZW Wi-FI” in the top left corner?From the coverage maps online it appears all have spotty coverage, but I live just south of Daytona Beach in New Smyna Beach, FL, which shouldn't be that bad. Only thing I can imagine is the airport regarding the poor 4G LTE coverage.Is the bad signal for all carriers cuz if I were you I would be looking for another provider one that at least can get you 3 bars LTE indoor.Go into your router and turn on qos.  Your wifi calling will be basically flawless once you frt the settings right.Without knowing anything about your network environment, it's somewhat difficult to recommend a solution. In general, you can try enabling QoS on your router to prioritize the WiFi Calling traffic. I know it's UDP ports 500 and 4500. Not sure what outbound IP you need. Google can help you with that.",22,756,0.029100529,0.029100529,1,756,42.52,25.78,54.78,31.1,22.91,20.11,84.39,65.61,53.44,14.42,8.6,4.63,0.26,3.31,0.13,0.26,5.82,12.57,5.95,2.12,12.3,10.45,5.03,5.95,1.46,17.33,5.29,3.31,2.91,0.79,1.32,0.79,16.01,1.06,14.95,1.98,1.59,2.51,2.78,1.19,4.76,0,3.7,2.25,1.46,1.32,0.79,0.53,0,0,0,0,8.73,3.57,0.13,0.13,0.26,0.26,1.98,4.63,0.4,0,0.53,0,5.56,0,0,5.56,3.31,0.53,0.93,1.59,0.66,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0.53,0.13,0.26,0.13,0,0,0,0.53,6.75,8.07,0.53,1.32,5.42,0.66,0.4,0.13,3.31,3.44,6.22,0.4,0.93,0.79,0.13,0,0,13.76,5.56,3.04,1.06,0,2.25,1.85,
True advertisement: Our problems will not be solved by newer cars. They will only be solved by fewer cars.

Or simply walking. Of course, you'd have to design your cities properly and not for cars, and people seem to not understand how that works.FTFY Just like cigarettes, public opinion started to change when they first outlawed ads about them, and then progressively went on to harsher measures to inform about how bad they were for your health. The exact same thing should be done for cars.honest question, what do I do in a city like Winnipeg? There are no trains. The bus system is horrid, and would take me 3 hours for a trip across the city where my car takes 30 minutes. Biking is okay here in the summer, but our winters are absolutely brutal. I want to help with this movement, but I feel stuck.Use deterrence, not criminalisation to lower car ownership. Nah, do what smoking regulations do and have warnings in adverts and documents saying ""building a car generates vast CO2 emissions that will take 5 years to make up"" or ""car tyres generate the majority of microplastic pollution whose impact on our health is still not well understood.""it should be illegal to market a car as eco friendly or safe. you want to know whats really safe and eco friendly, a train.I think the problem, especially in the US, is that people literally don’t have a choice in whether owning a car is viable or not. Our infrastructure in many cities are designed around cars, not the people who actually live in them. We’ve tried our best to make it impossible to get anywhere without a car, and it’s worked in many places. It’s upsetting that many of us literally don’t even get a say in whether we even want a car or notSammmmmme. I love cars, but hate the infrastructure. Cars should be play or work horses. Not the waste of space and money to get people to work or stores.I love cars. I loved them from the moment my grandpa sat me in his car while he was watching me at the age of 3 and I released the parking brake and took the car for a very short drive down the gentle incline of his driveway before he realized what I had done and run over to stop the car from rolling into the street. I love driving, I love all kinds of cars, I've owned many in my lifetime and always buy a car that I will enjoy driving. That said, I hate traffic and I live in a walkable neighborhood in a town with good public transit because I absolutely hate commuting. I want to take a car out for a fun drive or to explore in the country. I want to use my car like people use horses. I was thrilled when my street had two lanes removed and replaced with protected bike lanes. All of a sudden more people are walking on my street. I want my town to spend more money to expand their light rail, add more street cars, add more bus lines, and narrow even more streets. I'm opposed to expanding highways. And that said, I will always have a car. I just want that car to be a little topless roadster that I take out on the weekends when the weather is nice.Usually with only one person in it at a time. But you've got to have all that space and carrying ability for the once in a blue moon when you will actually use it. It's not like you can rent when you actually need to haul heavy items. /sAt least those are cars, in America they would be all monster trucks and suv's.Honest question, who the heck ever claimed that electric cars solve congestion?
This post feels like a strawman argument. You can shit on UBER when they claim they solve congestion, same for self driving cars, but I never heard the same argument withy hybrid or electric cars.This is sick. I want to get a minimalist version of this on a T shirt.https://ecohustler.com/technology/guerilla-take-over-of-100-uk-billboards-in-anti-car-protest This post has reached r/all.

Twitter user thinks trains are obsolete technology,"Yes, and it costs $700 in the cheapest sleeper. The Chinese train is $90 and you don't need a sleeper.Oh that's the scheduled time. Actual time is going to be way longer. I'd say closer to 25 hours.Yep, 19 hours. It was also several hours late when I tried this trip. The long haul trains are crazy slow here. To put it in perspective, the train trip goes 1540km, which is the driving distance from Zagreb to Denmark.are these figures accurate? 19 hours?:D I drove to croatia from Sweden in way less timeSince the FAA was formed in 1958 I assume they mean air travel. In some ways there are pretty obvious benefits of air travel, a big one being that it doesn't require a road or a track between the locations. However there are some real downsides like c02 emissions and the need for greater security following  9/11.  So their argument might make sense, but only if they are completely ignoring environmental impacts.The Shinkansen opened in 1964No, the technology was just cranking the oil propaganda up to 11What technological marvel did we discover in the mid 60s that made trains obsolete? The dual cup holder?Murican stupidityHigh speed trains that take 4.3 hours are obselete since the mid 60s. The current brand new technology takes 19.5 hours.So....we couldn’tAlso a lot of lines here are technically not publicly ownedOld doesn’t necessarily mean bad. There is a reason why SD40s are still rolling, albeit with much newer electronics and newer technology added in.Don’t worry Elon will build that Hyperloop will be said he will!Yeah our trains are outdated because we never got the infrastructure to update it. We could've had China's trains before they did, but couldn't.Just totally ignored the part where trains take 5 hours from security to city center and the same route planes take 5 hours from security to city center. Just totally ignored how trains dont need to wait 30 minutes for baggage. Just totally ignored how well ran trains aren't just delayed by 7 hours because of a storm in the other part of the continent. Just totally ignored how a train conductor shortages is not an issue that will take decades to fix.Also airplanes hub and spoke system, so some of the people flying between Chicago and New York are going to a different destination.Some of the most embarrassing denialism I've ever seen has been in conversations about car-dependent infrastructure. I've seen people deny or awkwardly avoid addressing induced demand, zoning laws, that medium-density is even a thing, examples of successfully moving away from car-dependent infrastructure, the economics of car-dependent suburbs, obviously the fact that other countries have public transit networks, and even that cars cost money to own and operate. I don't mean that they draw different conclusions from this information. I mean people who, when confronted with information that challenges their position, just completely shut shut down and ignore it.Mfer really just ignored the part where OOP said Beijing-Shanghai is less than 5 hours by train; for reference, car travel is far longer than 10 hours but still several hours faster than by Amtrak.Our equipment isn't even outdated though. The new Amtrak charger trains (are only a few years old and most are still being shipped today) are just as good as European diesel trains. It's the shitty track quality and the fact that freight railroads have Amtrak by the balls that is the primary issue.Also, what the shit happened in the 60s?I think the outdated equipments has a less chance to crash or kill a person?At some point one becomes the other. Outdated equipment is comprised of obsolete technology, i.e., steam locomotives.Computers are will never take off. Written from my Apple II eThere's a difference between obsolete technology and outdated equipment.I believe there is a huge issue with American railways in that the vast majority of the infrastructure is owned by private freight operators and that amtrack the public passenger railway company essentially has to negotiate the hire of these tracks. Even when amtrack has access the freight companies naturally prioritise themselves over passenger traffic. Added to that the business model of the freight railways in the US is to run a small number of very large trains with lots of capacity. This means that they don't tend to need such luxuries like dual tracks or electrification making the situation for passengers worse Where American passenger rail does seem to work well is when the government has bought out the trackbeds.

VW ID.4: Software bugs are not trivial,"its so crazy that people really think getting software locked features that you already paid for unlocked over many months is somehow a good thing.The great thing about my Tesla Model 3 are the over the air updates. Every month, the software improves. When I bought it, my side cameras weren’t activated. A few months later, heated seat controls showed up, another month, they showed up for the back seats. I’ve had updates that gave me better braking, 5% more power, and 5% faster acceleration. It constantly evolves.Its a brilliant plan. Sell this version to other incumbents then replace theirs with something better! /sYet they have stated their willing to sell their software to other incumbents!!!That must only be true for cars built in the states though. Never heard anyone complain about electrical issues on VWs here in Germany.It's like people have never owned a VW before. This is the company famous for electrical gremlins. Did you think the ID4 would be any different?and it wont matter the slightest cause most of their customers are older people that just dont car.Read this article to understand how far behind the legacy car makers are.Wait…OEMs don’t make flawless cars…🤯VW engineers finally at least have the emissions work-around fixed.This is why I go the CPO route. At 1-year or 2-years old, most issues are either well known or ironed out.No worries, OP isn't actually the owner. Just an agenda-driven account now apparently scouring through VW communities looking for issues to repost.This is why I keep reminding myself never to buy a new car in its first year of production.Just as an FYI, it’s not just VW that releases buggy software.  Polestar (ne Volvo) also release junky software.  And has ford even released an OTA yet for the MachE?This is 100% correct. Many current vehicles (both ICE and EV) will be scrapped early because of screen failures.For whatever it's worth, I have no problem with the headlights, wipers, etc. being controlled by the touchscreen on my Model 3.Does VW hide such functions in the infotainment system? I don't remember looking for the headlight operations when I test drove the ID4.As someone who thinks Volkswagen is one of the EV leaders amongst legacy OEMs, they really dropped the ball on the software side. And it's not just the ID vehicles either... The same stupid infotainment systems are now on cars like the ICE Golf and Multivan.I think this is the big shift VW and the rest have to make, which is they can not constantly move micro features up each year and have different cars to target with firmware, they also can not get caught in not releasing firmware to existing fleet and adding features.  This is a fundamental model shift for them and I am not sure how they handle it.  Tesla sells the same looking for year after year and keeps updating even the oldest car. This is what appeals people to the brand when it comes to software.  VW could do the same and set out to change things that would not impact the software stack like color and rims etc.... stuff not in the software house to care, and still be able to make each model year look different enough to spur some sales along.   The reality is you can not fundamentally change a car every 36 months and hit it with well written software for 10 years, the trailer of legacy hardware will sink you.  So I wish them luck and I hope they make it happen, Tesla needs some one to be there FOILThe ability to release OTA updates means nothing if the company has no track record of providing meaningful and value delivering changes.

What are the key elements required for creating an IT disaster recovery plan?,"I kept mine simple. First list all the things that could go wrong. Malware attacks, server crashes, etc. List the services affected by those problems and an acceptable amount of downtime. List all of the people you might have to contact in different scenarios and make sure to note when to contact whom. Then write a ""run book"" or step by step guide that tells you or whoever is handling it exactly what steps to take. and don't keep it on the server.C-level buy-in and active involvement. IT cannot and should not do the DRP by itself, period. Annual testing of the DRP through tabletop exercises with all involved departments Minimum quarterly testing of backup restoration capabilities.

What is DRaaS?,"Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) is an advance, complex yet one window approach for data maintenance.

It offers everything Google Workspace does, plus provides a replacement option for AD.Nothing cheaper will work as well as AD for identity.

What is more stressful? DevOps or Software coding? (Software Developers),"So much of the time your first line DevOps folks are getting the call regardless. But in this day and age, with the proper planning, and depending on the company like others have said, it really depends on where your stress is at.  Do you want to worry about a server overload of traffic, bad memory etc, or that traffic failing miserably b/c of a software bug. So choose you're poison. Until my current job, all jobs have been both devops and software engineering(i'm old) for me.  I can fix a bungled up server, reroute traffic as required, have rollback plans at the touch of my fingers.  But if you're codebase takes 20 minutes to compile, just so you can test your one line perfect fix....what do you want to deal with? I realize that's not an answer.   But it really is up to you..I do both, but I wouldn’t call either stressful as i live for it.Could you elaborate why?Hahaha so true. “Hey that cool tool that does X Y and Z out of the box is super valuable for us! Can you quickly whip up a homegrown alternative?”“DevOps” you do both development for tools company don’t wanna pay for and meet the ridiculous timeline that was promised to the client on a budget.Development is very low stress once you realize that development deadlines don't matter much. It's done when it's done. If the client sets unreasonable deadlines then it will be 'done' with a shitload of bugs.Yeah, bad managers are the source of stress.I've never found either stressful compared to anything else I've done. I've been lucky I suppose on the devil's side. If software is stressful, then it's being done wrong.This is like asking if a painting is pretty. It depends on the person. Me personally I do write a lot of software and I enjoy writing software but I've firmly decided I could never work as a software developer. Because I can't code on demand. I enjoy coding when it's something I like, something I want to do. So in the ops field I only have to code short automations to help the devs. That's good for me on a professional level. And when I go home I can still work on development projects on my own.1 per 10? Lmfao. Okay, buddy. Try 1 per 25+. But yeah, what this guy said nails it.That last point hit me right in my soul.DevOpsWhen did you last work as a Software developer. We currently have three concurrent projects. And the whole team is working on them. Although they base on the same hardware platform the applications are vastly different. For our DevOps Team it is more ease as they only work on our Backendplatform which is for all Projects the same. But we are a small company that just started to grow. Hopefully it will be better soonish.Not so bad if you work as an internal and deal mostly with other developers. The cookie jar thingy is very true tho.this. lots of plates spinning that goes on in DevOps.DevOps most the time. Software you usually work on 1 project at a time. DevOps you have your hands in multiple cookie jars and are a go to for support for either help or when anything goes wrong.At the end of the day though it really depends on the company. Some campaniles have bad marketing/customer relations departments where they over promise features to clients so next thing you know you’re doing a years worth of work in 2-3 sprints.Depends who is on call when things break at 3 AM.",13,615,0.021138211,0.021138211,1,619,29.7,35.44,56.81,13.33,16.73,17.29,89.66,70.92,59.13,15.83,9.69,4.85,0.81,3.23,0,0.65,6.14,13.57,6.46,1.94,13.41,11.47,6.46,8.4,1.29,16.96,7.27,4.52,4.2,1.62,2.1,0.48,14.05,0.65,13.41,1.62,1.29,2.26,3.39,0.97,5.33,0.16,5.17,2.26,2.91,2.42,0.48,1.94,1.13,0,0,0.16,10.99,3.72,0.81,0,0,0.65,1.62,6.79,0.16,0.16,0,0.16,1.78,0.16,0,1.62,6.79,0,0.16,5.82,0.81,0.32,0.97,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0,0.48,0.81,0.32,0,0,0,0,0.16,0.16,6.79,4.85,0,0.81,4.04,0,0,0.32,4.68,2.91,7.75,1.29,1.29,0.81,0.48,0,0,16.8,8.56,2.42,0.65,0.16,3.39,1.62,

Jobs are plentiful as software developers, find one that is suited to your passions and skillset or you may quickly find yourself disillusioned by a fad ""crypto"" company when cryptocurrencies disappear from the limelight (as they very frequently do for large periods of time)Not to say you shouldn't learn, there are definitely great youtube videos and podcasts explaining what cryptos are, the technical details behind them, etc. I have found the bad crypto podcast to be pretty decent at explaining the concepts.

Our area of focus is more along the lines of data classification and privacy, and does it conform to our established policies.To go with 6 and 7 - what level of support is available, uptime history etc. This is tied to the business continuity aspect, in that the more critical the product or system is to our functioning, the more responsive support we need.

What would you recommend for a mathematician and R person who really sucks at software/computing to learn Python as well? Or: how is Python so much more difficult than R?,"I always recommend the official python tutorial to mathematicians.So I decided to learn Python and I'm glad I did. I got through all the process and difficulties that you mentioned and find answers for all of them in years. I'll give my advises and answers for some of your questions.I can see your point because I was just in your place years ago. I was doing my econometrics and time seriss analysis on Eviews (it's a specified software for doing time series analysis and consist of related menus) One day I decided to apply some of my ideas partly including neural networks (I knew the theory well just like you) but understood it's almost impossible to implement one on Eviews.  I've always hated Matlab and R. So, I didn't want to learn anything about them. I had to use a specific software called RATS (what a name!) for time series analysis back in days I was studying at universe and R always remembers me that software. And I didn't want to see the infinite numbers of menus of Matlab.plan of learning: im not sure how you learn best. but i can share a list of curated resources you could look at. the python discord resources listrecommended IDE: start with anything that can edit text files. Don't rely on IDE features at the start - it helps you learn if you're forced to think about every character. Once you understand the basics, move to jupyter-lab. it allows you to define cells of code you can run individually, which is really helpful if you don't want to load a lot of data each time you try something.don't bother with anaconda until you know exactly why you need it.recommend installing method: official python.org  installeryou don't need conda for that, python has had venv built in for many years now.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM&list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc  or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM&t=98s you can audit it (so free) harvard has a python course on edx

you tell one environment to use the 3.1 package
and you tell the other environment to use the 2.9 package company 1 is using machine learning package 3.1
company 2 is using machine learning package 2.9 let's say you're a consultant and you're currently doing projects for 2 companies conda itself may need to be updated
or maybe you want to install an old version of a specific package anaconda manages the packages and versions that come with anaconda
so although you can use pip with anaconda it is much preferred to use conda with anaconda so that you get the versions and packages moderated and known to work with anaconda pip is usually just for a plain python installation
conda is for anaconda but actually so many things are included by default that you probably won't have to install anything yeah, not that intuitive for me either
but this is how to do it
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-packages/#filtering-the-packages-table because it includes so many ""packages"" by default No idea what this could possibly mean. Is <- the assignment operator? If so then why is = used the same way in the same statement? What operation does ~ describe, if any? What is sth? Whereas:""Let ols be a new value of type LinearRegression; retrieve the value's fit method and call it with values X and y.""Harvard has a CS50 class for Python that I think could be what you need.IDE choice: literally any, it doesn't fucking matter. notepad++ and a terminal window are sufficient. I think the variable explorer thing may even be acting like a crutch for you -- it's a very important skill to be able to run a program in your head and mentally track what value each variable has as the program evolves (or at least, be able to reason about its possible values in a way that's useful). if you want more, use a print statement. that said, the IPython REPL is a straight upgrade from the normal REPL, it's very nice for when you're working interactively. if you don't understand classes, that's okay for now, you don't quite need them yet. but not understanding basic method call syntax, variables, data structures etc -- sorry but you just need to git gud. this stuff is table stakes. just spend a week going through tutorials and reading docs, I promise it isn't as hard as you think. if you can do math and you can use R, you can understand basic python control flow and syntax. lose the self-defeating mindset that you're ""bad at computer programming"". I believe in you! it sounds like you've just imprinted on the R way of doing things; you've memorized and are reproducing a bunch of tricks without grasping the underlying ideas. it isn't all that different to what python does, and the ways in which R really does differ drastically from python (nonstandard evaluation, OOP), you aren't using yourself anyway. for your purposes the differences are surface level. it's like writing dx/dt vs ẋ -- same thing. you've already memorized like nine different ways of writing a derivative; shit like this is par for the course in any human notation system. compared to R, python has a single sane object model, comprehensible error messages, predictable type conversion rules, useful and well-behaved built-in data structures, and better documentation. python is a lot more consistent than R. it doesn't have most of the bullshit detailed here: https://github.com/ReeceGoding/Frustration-One-Year-With-R all this stuff isn't about python itself, it's about all the half-working bullshit that has accreted around it. my advice: dont bother with anaconda, just install python normally and use pip to get numpy and scipy and so on. the need for anaconda has diminished over the years; it was originally made because those packages were hard to install, but now it just works. https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/pz4t50/official_salary_sharing_thread_october_2021/ We have a salary-sharing thread for European roles, including the UK, at CSCQEU.

What's the oldest technology you've had to deal with in your career?,"A significant portion of my business still uses 3270 emulationMy first job was as a sysadmin/help desk for COBOL developers connecting to a remote mainframe using 3270 emulators.I suspect that many have similar stories.  Microsoft's Migration Tool for NetWare on NT 4 likely was the first step for many a seasoned admin - and the last step for Novell on many networks.NetWare was a special and unique piece of crap that holds a comedic spot in my heart. I learned NetWare 6 in school(2007-ish) and remember being constantly blown away by it's strange quirks and that you had to install it on top of Windows 98. Just adding something to the default path was a whole process. To this day, my college roommate and I make fun of it. Looking back though, it's clear that NetWare was just the last vestige of a very, very old school way of doing things. A time where it wasn't uncommon for a system to be a hodgepodge of pieces and extensions from various vendors added directly into the OS.I can remember having to 'create' Netware 2. You'd choose the proper driver obj's for your hardware and run a compile/link to get the actual program. The arrival of Netware 3 eliminated all of that.I started on Netware 3. Honestly I loved netware. Last release we had in production was 5 something.I did a CNE and then promptly never touched Netware again. LolNovell NetWare 5 with Windows NT Clients. That's where I started my enterprise career.Those old Solaris boxes could run forever. I once decommissioned one that had over 6.5years uptime.I remember buying a Sparcstation 10 with 256mb of RAM for $100 at an auction.  It had a bad backplane, was out of warranty, and cost too much to fix.  I knew several Sun techs and one came up with one for me.  :)Not that old but a Solaris 2.6 server from 1997 that had been running ever since, and afaik it's still running. I came into contact with it when the org was moving IP subnets and had to change IP on it, so they called in the Linux expert. I'm not completely lost in Solaris, I've used Solaris 10 and 11 a lot 10 years ago, but this was a bit different. Had to figure out that it was running a very early version of ipf, which is the predecessor to OpenBSD PF. So I actually recognized the syntax from using PF on my homelab router. Which was good because merely changing the IP was not enough, had to update a lot of FW rules too. This is at a major government institution btw, dealing with health care of course. I kept telling the local DC tech that I could replace this for them easily with a Linux server. We'll see if they get back in touch.I'd think that reseating everything that often would cause more problems.Now I feel old as I used to build machines of that era, probably 100+ of them…I'd highly suggest taking an image of systems like this. I've had surprisingly good luck virtualizing some of these systems and running them on modern industrial hardware. The real trick is how they communicate with the hardware. Quite a few are actually just communicating over serial cables. Depending on what virtualization host you are using interfacing the VMs with hardware serial ports can be super easy to just straight forward with lots of steps. I've even had luck running the VMs in the dame building's racks/data center. And connecting to the hardware via Serial to IP adapters. Host system connects to the Serial-to-IP adapter and presents it as a native serial port to the VM. This was over a decade ago using mainly VMware products at the time. I'd hope/imagine the hypervisors have gotten even better as simulating old COMM and LPT ports both locally and with remote IP hardware.p2v it now (even if you just keep the V as a backup) if it dies, you will be scrabbling around on ebay to find ancient compatible SCSI cards and hoping that you can remember how termination works in order to get them working, and all of that while people are screaming at you that its broken. you can at least start working out how it might be virtualised, without any downtime other than the p2v-ing.Would it be easier to virtualise it? We did that for old computers running os/2 for lab instruments.We had something similar at a plastic molding factory in Florida up until we sold the business. The first time we had issues with it I went and bought an old PC with almost the same specs and a new but old stock SCSI drive and cloned the machine onto it so that I had a backup. When we sold the company I handed off documentation regarding the system, including the contact information for the guy who owned the company that originally made the software, and informed their tech person that there was a spare machine. A few months after the transition service agreement ended we got a phone call begging for help because the machine had died, I told them that their tech guy should know where the spare is and have the documentation on how to set it all back up. Apparently the guy had left and the MSP they hired chucked the spare. So instead of being up and running in a few hours it took sending the drive off to a data recovery company and a lot of phone calls to people who had long retired. Instead of the cost of storing some ancient parts as a spare it cost them tens of thousands of dollars in recovery attempts and contractor costs, because the retirees had a copy of the software still. I'd guess that the MSP thought that by getting rid of the spare  they could get a project to replace the system with something modern and expensive that they could off charge for, but the only companies that made anything that could do with this equipment did cost close to a million in new hardware and software. I can understand not upgrading these systems, especially because despite being old and fairly simple technology it just works, but I'll never understand people who fail to plan for their inevitable failure. I know that being counters can be incredibly pessimistic, so I always sell it as, ""if your computer stops working how much is it worth to be able to get you up and running in a few hours?"" Because the answer to that question is almost always ""whatever it takes."" Because they're so self-important. After they give me that, or an actual number I follow with, ""so what is it worth to make sure that we can get an entire plant up and running again in a few hours, including the cost of manufacturing staff being idle?"" I've used that same logic to successfully negotiate hot spares for workstations, networking equipment, and failover systems for site servers. I know that there are finance folks out there that would take the risk, but thankfully I've yet to meet them.Last week I had to  unplug all of the SCSI cables, open the case,  and clean out the dust from the Windows 98 beige box running an industrial foam packaging cutting table. The notes from one of the many techs who've worked on this beast say, ""once every couple of months unplug everything, pull all of the cards out, blow out the dust, reseat the cards and plug everything back in, pray that it comes back up when you press the power button"". This thing has been running two shifts a day 5 days a week since they bought it in 2002. The company that built is long gone (purchased by a competitor), the company that sold it to them is also gone, and the one original tech is in his 80's and retired to Florida. When I started he faxed me some troubleshooting tips. I also replaced the pc on an Entwistle box maker a few months ago, the box maker machine itself was built in the 70's. The computers added in the 80's. ETA: In all it's late 90's glory.IBM dumb terminals connected via twinax to the mainframe.Use gotek (emulates the floppy drive) as it has a usb port? Has floppy connections.You would think that would give grounds for the budget to stand up the replacement in parallel...When i first started in IT the company I worked for had an archive of software on 8"" floppies.A old sign control board that used 5 ¹/⁴ floppies to run the proprietary software. Had to special order the floppies and drives that allowed them to make copies in the future. We found a guy who specializes in making old floppy drives usb compatible. He even makes the drivers for them for windows. We obviously emphasized to upgrade the unit but it was being used by the county to update traffic warnings on the highway so it was incredibly critical and couldn't simply be swapped out.",36,1538,0.023407022,0.023407022,1,1545,67.91,37.82,54.69,30.84,24.92,19.22,84.92,69.9,55.66,13.4,6.73,3.3,0.71,0.84,0.19,1.42,6.67,16.25,9.06,3.04,13.98,7.77,5.89,5.89,0.52,16.18,5.95,5.5,2.65,0.91,1.17,0.78,11.65,1.29,10.36,2.39,2.33,1.68,1.68,0.84,2.27,0.26,2.59,1.62,0.84,0.71,0.52,0.13,0,0,0,0.06,7.06,2.2,0.19,0.06,0,0.06,1.1,4.21,0.06,0.06,0.06,0.58,2.2,0.06,0,2.14,4.79,0.06,0.32,2.91,1.55,0.06,0.45,0.19,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,1.04,0.13,1.1,0.13,0,0,0.13,0.32,0.26,4.4,8.09,0.19,2.01,5.31,0.26,0.06,0.26,5.37,6.8,3.11,0.71,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,12.23,5.24,2.65,0.26,0,2.01,2.07,
What's the smartest way to switch from software/computer engineering to management?,"There's no reliable path to what you want it's heavily luck based at that level.In all honesty, it depends on what sort of management you want to do?  You can get to director or higher by going architect first, or you can do low level management.  I know I'm not good at managing day in and day out stuff, so I'm not going to ever be low level, but I could be a director is the right position fell unti my lap. Never accept responsibility and tell other people what they should be doing.No shop with a clue is going to hire an engineering manager with zero real-world SDLC experience. Doesn't need to be ""banging on keyboards, cranking out PRs"" style experience -- could be QA, release management, product management, etc. They might hire a project manager with zero real-world SDLC experience. Alternatively, building your own organization and seating yourself at the head of it. If you're seeking a c-suite or director/VP level position, you're going to be looking at a lot of years with a single organization. Ladder climbing. Relationship building. Takes an enormous amount of trust for an executive or board to hire someone into such a role -- the existence or absence of that trust with the decision-makers is going to matter way more than anything present on your resume/CV.If your goal is to be in software management,  you'll be at a disadvantage in my opinion without some amount of actual hands-on experience. As a manager, you don't need to code, but you absolutely need to understand technical underpinnings well enough to make technical decisions and/or know when someone presents a good solution to a technical problem. I've known plenty of software managers who didn't have that background and, in my opinion, they did not do their jobs as well as those who did have that background. Having said that, objectively speaking, many of those managers without a hands-on technical background have had very good careers (looking at you, certain SVP at my current Fortune 500 employer), but they succeed in their careers for other reasons than their technical soundness.",2,356,0.005617978,0.005617978,1,357,50.95,56.77,50.63,72.85,25.5,25.49,90.2,69.19,56.02,13.73,8.96,2.52,0,3.92,0,1.96,4.76,14.29,5.32,1.4,15.69,11.2,3.36,6.44,2.52,19.33,5.88,6.16,6.44,0.84,1.12,4.48,17.93,1.4,15.69,3.08,1.4,2.8,4.2,0.28,6.16,0,4.48,3.92,0.56,0.84,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,11.76,1.68,0,0,0,0.28,0.84,10.08,0,0,0,0,2.52,0,0,2.52,9.24,0,0,8.68,0.56,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.84,0.56,0.84,0.84,0.56,0,0.84,0.28,0,5.88,8.4,0.28,0.84,6.44,0.56,0.56,0.28,1.96,2.52,4.76,3.08,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,17.93,4.48,5.32,0.28,0,3.08,4.76,
Which is better for software accessibility testing — manual testing or test automation?,"I remember hearing this at a conference some years ago..""Automation doesn't test anything, it validates things you've already tested.""Sure that's overly simplistic but there is huge value in the hybrid approach. Let computers do what they excel at, repetitive tasks that can be done at all times, over and over ..always the same way..and let people do what they excel at..exploring, pushing limits, finding edge cases..discovering new functional relationships inside an application.I've used an Exploratory test model in collaboration with a high value approach to automation and we've been very successful in catching issues and also not burning out the manual testing team.Using automation for accessibility testing is great. It can speed up the development and testing processes by quickly identifying accessibility goof-ups.But again, it is not 100% fool-proof. There are some issues that can be left out when accessibility tests are automated.Manual testing is a more reliable approach in accessibility testing to check for both complex and common errors related to accessibility.Given the time constraints that testers face, a hybrid approach that combines manual and automated tests is usually the way to go. This will guarantee that the accessibility tests comb through the entire application, rooting out any accessibility defects that may come up.Accessibility testing is a prerequisite to increasing user satisfaction and business too. Differently-abled people make up almost 15 percent of worldwide internet users. The Americans with disabilities act states that all domains like public institutions, schools, organizations etc. must make the technology and digital assets accessible to everyone.Organizations like Qualitest possess expert quality engineers with several years of experience in accessibility testing.

A great tool I use is Microsoft Accessibility Insights extension on Chrome. It does quick automation checks and provides you the instructions to do manual checks.
https://accessibilityinsights.io/A hybrid take has always been the go-to approach in my career. This could apply to most situations including this one. I think what he means by his statement rings true with general and edge cases. In general, most tasks (given the right amount of planning and time) will be able to be automated and stuck into a regressions test. However we will always have some edge cases that may not be accounted for, or may be more effort than worth to automate.",1,547,0.001828154,0.001828154,1,565,70.7,35.01,52.08,41.07,25.68,29.38,82.83,61.95,48.85,8.67,2.48,0.88,0.53,0.35,0.35,0.35,6.19,13.98,6.02,0.88,12.74,9.73,4.07,4.78,0.88,16.81,5.49,5.49,2.48,1.06,1.42,0.35,12.04,1.42,10.62,2.83,1.42,1.42,2.12,0.35,2.3,0.18,2.48,1.95,0.53,0.53,0.35,0.18,0,0,0,0,3.72,1.42,0.35,0,0,0,0.35,2.3,0,0,0,0.35,3.54,0,0,3.54,9.03,0,0,8.5,1.06,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,0.35,0,0.35,0,0.18,0,0.53,5.49,10.44,0.53,2.65,7.79,0,0.18,0,3.72,2.83,4.78,1.95,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,15.04,8.32,3.19,0,0,0.88,2.65,

Maybe my head is stuck in Core Audio mac stuff, but yeah obviously my code idea is wrong lolBecause they're flagged as a features, not as a bugs.Fellow software engineer here! I know for a fact that iOS (possibly Android) doesn't have an audio mixer that divides audio based on which app it's coming from, unlike say Windows or MacOS. The easiest solution is to just prioritize the last audio source so you don't miss phone calls or other important alerts.

"Yale-developed technology restores cell, organ function in pigs after death","you should ask about it for the amount of years that scientists and researchers did experiments on animals and other humans, if you want progress you throw ethics out the window, it's due to that research we have what we have today, and this can potentially save even more lives“BrainEx” is certainly right out of a movie script. Here we go!I'd like to know how the ethics played out here.Can I recommend the book series We are Legion(We are Bob) by Dennis E Taylor.  The protagonist comes across money at the start and pays a company to keep him alive after death.  He becomes resurrected in a machine in the future to explore space.  The audible version has some excellent narrationThe organs can still fail even after being kept ""alive"" i'm sure.Then, of course, there will be people who will want their brains kept viable after they die. That's when things get all Futurama on us.I suspect we'll soon get documents that, if we sign them, legally give doctors the right to  keep our organs alive after death so they can go to people on transplant lists. That'll save many lives.Bioethicists should weigh inOh interesting - this could be wonderful for the preservation of organ donation.If stem cell technology doesn't keep pace for repairing the bodies, we might end up with a Futurama ""head in the tank"" situation.If they can reanimate organs, you'd think they're not far from reanimating a human brain.Or even for reanimation of cryogenically frozen folks.As a 51 year old this may bridge the gap for me to live several hundred years moreI wonder if this has implications for cryonics. Many of the services offering to freeze you today need to wait until you actually die for legal reasons.

[Off Topic] I've always wanted to make my own Paradox-esque video game. Does anyone know what software/coding language I'd want to use if I wanted to teach myself how to code and create my own EU4-like game?,"Thanks man! I'm researching how to code in C++ right now. And yeh haha, the extent of my coding knowledge is R, Python, and Stata for statistics purposes. You gotta start somewhere if you want to learn how to code though. May as well make it a passion project.This thread might have something interesting for you. The game is built using an in-house engine called Clausewitz, but they haven’t released access to it. EUIV itself is written in C++. If you wanted to start into video game programming Unity and Unreal Engine would be the places to start in my opinion. However, looking at the broad nature of your question I assume you don’t have much experience with programming, so definitely make your research on other subreddits (or websites) to get you started.",4,134,0.029850746,0.029850746,1,134,39.26,62.2,69.28,67.25,14.89,18.66,85.82,68.66,53.73,13.43,9.7,2.99,0,5.97,0,0.75,3.73,9.7,4.48,0,14.18,8.96,6.72,8.21,1.49,20.9,2.99,0.75,0.75,0.75,0,0,21.64,0,21.64,5.22,4.48,2.24,6.72,0.75,5.97,0,2.99,2.99,0,0.75,0.75,0,0,0,0,0,11.94,3.73,0.75,0.75,0,0,2.99,8.21,0,0,0,0.75,2.99,0,0,2.99,8.21,2.24,0,5.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,1.49,0.75,1.49,0,0,0,0,2.24,7.46,5.97,0,0,5.22,0.75,0,0,3.73,2.99,5.22,2.24,2.24,2.24,0,0,0,19.4,6.72,4.48,0,0.75,2.24,5.22,

"[Serious] Blind/physically impaired people of Reddit, what has your actual experience with modern software/accessibility software been like? Has it significantly improved over time?","Mixed.  A lot of my personal experience hinges on other programmers sticking to design principles that are meant to be efficient but not always ""aesthetic"".  Things like:Going to a Java-heavy page only to have the reader not be able to ""read"" the dynamic media file that gives no contextual feedback;Forms that don't give layout context or flow in a logical way, leading to navigational confusion;Companies assuming disabled people always have someone to do things for them so accessibility gets viewed as wasted money since ""if it's important, they'll find someone with sight to do it for them"" (actual quote from a meeting I sat in over a decade ago);And so on.To be clear, the various accessibility overlays (such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, etc.) have done a good job of keeping up with the major software suites (Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc.) but frequently struggle with open-source software or less popular alternatives to work-based software (Heck, Job Access With Speech is right in the name!).  Is it better than back in the Windows 9x days? Certainly.  Can it still be improved on?  Definitely!Oftentimes I'm blown away by how far we've come in terms of accessibility software, to the point where I wonder how certain features or programs didn't exist already. But, for every cool thing, there are thousands more which don't even take disabled users into account.Attention!

[Software] Microsoft 365 Personal 1 Year - $19.99 (ANT Online ebay store),"Does this work in Mac OS?God how much I hate subscribing to a set of software that literally everyone needsTL;DR  you can easily reinstall this after a clean install. You have to sign in to a Microsoft account to use this, then it is linked to your account. It is meant for 1 person, so it can only be linked to 1 Microsoft account. But that 1 person can use it on up to 5 devices, and it's easy to deactivate old devices you're not using it on if Microsoft still shows your old Windows installation as an active device.I see that this is for “1 person”. Does that mean it’s associated with my Microsoft login OR does it only work on one PC? If it’s the latter, if I do a clean install of windows, can I still use Microsoft 365 software afterwards, or would I have the same issue I described above (with the Microsoft Office software I get from r/microsoftsoftwareswap)?This is cheaper then via my job so I'll go ahead and add a year from here instead.Yup, somebody confirmed itI'm assuming I can buy these now with intent to activate later, or at least space out the redemption?Keep in mind the lifetime Microsoft Office doesn't include OneDrive (just the 5gb free version which anyone gets). $20 for 1tb cloud storage alone is an amazing deal even if you only use like 100-200gb in the cloud.Office 2021 starts at $150, non-subscription.Probably get one of these. Is there a non-subscription base Microsoft Office?This is an insane deal. I just bought 5 to use on my Family plan. $100 for about 4 years. Wow.that's only for the first year though. At the end of which it costs $70 for 1tb/year.  You could use it for a year and then transfer to something else, but that's kind of a pain.Does that make it worth it?The real secret is buying a throwaway domain to make a google enterprise account for ~$10/month and getting unlimited cloud storage. Google advertises a 2TB limit, but I am well over that and can keep storing more.This comes with Onedrive as well... Wow $20 for 1tb seems pretty hard to beat alone. Edit: idrive seems like best competition at $60 for 5tb/year, but that's a lot of storage space which a lot of people may not need. Google Drive is expensive at $30 for 200gb/year or $100 for 2tb/year DropBox is $120 for 2tb/year. I use Google Sheets primarily at home so Excel wasn't a huge bonus for the 365 Personal, and Word I don't really use.

So much cheaperWas looking for a good deal on a retail (non-365) version of Office since pre-Black Friday and this is the best legit version/price I've seen. It's missing OneNote since they haven't officially updated it since 2016 (unless you count the different Windows 10 free version), but you can download a copy from https://www.onenote.com/download. I've read that additional features unlock if you have an Office 365 or retail version installed as well.Where can I findMost of those keys are data extracted from a virus infected pc.  This is one way a botnet can make money.  Also another source is they use stolen credit cards to buy keys for software as a way to launder money from the stolen cards without have to get physical goods. These cd keys are often working at first but months or years later will no longer activate after they sell the same key numbers on multiple sites to many different people.  Microsoft generally does not deactivate existing copies but reinstalling on a new pc may not work later with that same key.I think the markets for people buying legally and in grey market is different, and clearly this applies to the latterIf you're going to pay someone to steal it for you, just skip the middle man and steal it yourself.I recommend buying a key from eBay for a few dollars over doing this.And amazing!You may also be entitled to a home license if you use MS Office at work.

Their system includes inventory of 3rd parties that they basically sell on their behalf. Again, this is with items that explicitly say ""Sold by Walmart"", not the marketplace stuff. Case in point, there was a deal awhile back for an Anne Pro 2 ""sold by Walmart"". I placed an order and later got contacted by a 3rd party seller telling me the item was backordered and asking me if I wanted to cancel or wait. I was super confused and thought it might have been a scam and contacted walmart support, who told me it was legit and I needed to confirm with that 3rd party to complete or cancel my order. Others on here also had the same experience with that deal.This is a permanent license so you do not need to pay for a subscription. niceIf you require a Microsoft office business license this is the lowest price it has ever been at from an authorized seller.

[serious] What’s one thing you still prefer to do the old-fashioned way—regardless of technology—and why?,"“You will own nothing and be happy”Stresses me out having more monthly payments to remember than I actually need.I still do this with my music. Buy everything on Amazon music so I can own it forever. Also RIP Google Play Music, you were the best.I don't think there's a single person in existence who enjoys paying for something perpetually though.Honestly sammmmeeeee. It drives me crazy that everything nowadays is a fucking subscriptionI was considering getting a subscription to a editing program i like and realized you can buy a permanent license for $50 and the subscription costs $5 a month it would pay for itself in 10 months.I honestly prefer buying things completely instead of paying a monthly fee.I only have a few photos in a photo album but I love this idea, I need to get a camera that prints out the pictures itselfThere’s something satisfying and nostalgic about seeing the physical photos. I have my favorites displayed in frames, so I can see them every day. Makes me happy.I print photos and keep them in photo albums. I like to keep the special moments of life as a book and go through it page by page.Tabletop Simulator's Dominion rules thoughYeah, playing web versions even in discord with friends it's fun, but it's not the same. Not seeing their faces, not sharing food and drinks, it's like you are not giving them your full attention.FWIW A lot of digital board/card games are online and allow you to play with/against others. The occasional online UNO match vs 3 randoms is kinda fun. Though I do agree that games irl are much better and much more fun.Axis and Allies is the exception to this.  The board game takes so fucking long to set up.Great answer. Shuffling and fanning cards just feels so satisfying tooWith physical you can change rules, its fun to do when you know a game well enough and everyone has their own version of monopoly.Yes! Family game night is a weekly occurrence for us. We have close to 100 board games.Especially old ones. My friend has a Trivial Pursuit from the 80s. All questions are completly impossible, so we added improv/clues/charades. Funniest boardgame I have ever played.Physical board games/card games. Most of the app versions of the games I like aren't that great. Plus, it's more fun to play with someone.Attention!

been almost 2 years using Poco X3nfc and even in 2022 it's giving quite good performance and battery life. Overall been a good experience using the device but slightly let down by delayed software updates. No signs of MIUI 13 or andriod 12 on the global version.,"I can recommend ArrowOS (for simplicity and very quick updates) or Evolution X (Custom Kernel and few added settings but still very quick updates).Pixel Experience Plus is also supposedly nice! I think I haven't tried that one. Also keep in mind that you'll lose some features with Vanilla Android, vs MIUI. ^^True, animations and transitions became very slow. I just changed the transition/animation scale from 1 to 0.5 from developer settings and so far it's a smooth experience and not like it's glitching or anything.my biggest mistake regarding this phone was to upgrade it to miui 12 from 11. It completely changed my user experience from very smooth to annoyingly slow and hicups. Opening apps and ram management got worse. Right now i am thinking to get some good custom rom.it's set to 490dp also... that last 15% would last you an hour or so ez. worrying about battery isn't a problem on the x3nfcHey just off topic what is your screen minimum width set to?.....btw that's insane battery life although I get like 7 hrs of sot till my battery reaches like 15% after which I put it on chargeI got x3 NFC using custom ROM and root and it's been with me since launch amazing phoneHow much $ did you managed to get out of it?I just sold my poco x3 nfc to upgrade to poco f3.. i miss installing custom romsI'm still using it right now. So far so good. the only problem that I have is the microphone. Not working properly.Updates will probably slow down the phone more. Better off not updating unless your apps can't run.Of course OP is using it, there it says the screen has been used for 9 hours.how do get 9h? are u even using it?Install ArrowOS if you want 12Woooow 9hrs of screen time? That's amazing! I've had mine X3 NFC since January 2021 and the battery barely runs more that 5-6 hours. I installed ArrowOS 12.1 and now it's even buglessThe same here, really love it! Changing my wallpaper and case occasionally always makes me feel like I have a new phone that runs perfectly. I have tried the new version of Poco launcher and I can say it feels a little bit smoother. Maybe in some time I'll try a custom ROM.Did you see the battery life? why do you assume that it needs a new battery when OP literally gets over 9h SoT without power saver mode.2 years only? Buy new battery and enjoy for 2 more years. Why you need miui 12 or 13? Who cares for that bs, today with apps or rooting you can make phone look and behave how you wantDoes it have 120hz always on or is it on 60hz?Why do you care about new android versions?Still love my x3 nfc. Bought it in September 2020 and it never let me down. Like you i got annoyed with slow updates so i switched to custom roms after a bit more than 12 months on official miui.X3 NFC here, running 12.5.8, zero issues to report apart from the occasional hang up, which shows up once a month pretty rng.One thing about miui is most of the new Android features comes from updating security and system apps. Even if not for all the features some of the features can be unlocked by updating security app from time to time. I suppose miui 13 for poco x3 will be a disaster as they don't want any phone to run for more than 2 years. I am still in 12.5.5 and seeing 2 updates pending in queue already since most of the users reported faulty camera and speaker after updates ,i have not updated past 12.5.5. It's better to wait and see user reviews before updating to latest version.Miui13 with android 12 and the latest poco launcher I have had to download via APK, runs great and smooth on my F3 8/256 I honestly like the OS.I'm using the same phone and custom rom after the warranty gone. I'm pretty confident to say this phone is still reliable in 2022Idk, I have 3 phones in my family with MIUI 13 and they are fine, but from what I read the experience is pretty rng.Not exactly. I've been using for nearly two months and I'm fine with it. Basically only 2 complaints I remember: Playback notification bug: happily it appears when it has to appear and doesn't disappear when needed (something that happened in MIUI 12.5), but the album artwork tends to not update and stay til the next song sometimes. Battery life seems to be inconsistent. Sometimes I feel it lasts for a decent amount of time and sometimes not so much (also based on what's shown from SOT and active time)Miui 13 is a mess, consider it a blessingI got MIUI13 on the X3 pro (global/vayu version, that came with NFC and was sold outside India. I live in Central Europe)  quite a while ago. Late March or early April, not entirely sure. It is the global version. Honestly though, aside from the weird theme matching app colours and some less than welcome changes in how widgets work, it wasn't a great update. I actually liked 12.5 a bit more, and I feel like the battery life also got a bit shorter (very minimal, might just be my imagination though). Honestly, there is little to no actual advantages on being Android 12 with the X3 rn.Is the X3 supposed to get MIUI 13 ? Does Xiaomi.eu for your phone have MIUI 13 ? Yeah, it should have gotten it in Q2, currently discussions are around late Q3 and early Q4, but who knows.When they announced MIUI 13, poco x3nfc was one of their supported devices but so far we only reveived MIUI 12.5 updates.I have a Poco F3 and not much has changed really, going from 12.5 to 13… You'll barely notice it's Android 12, because the MIUI Skin is still the same.. Is the X3 supposed to get MIUI 13 ? Does Xiaomi.eu for your phone have MIUI 13 ?Same here. Been looking for a phone that could replace my Poco X3 NFC that I bought during launch day and the selection is just disappointing, to be honest. Pretty much every single phone released in the past 2 years look the same to me. Right now, the only phone that caught my eye was the Nothing Phone 1 with its really unique back design, reasonable specs and near-stock Android experience. On a more positive note, my Poco X3 NFC is still performing great and I think I'll be resorting to flashing custom ROMs while waiting for a phone that's worthy enough to replace it.I've been thinking about iPhone 11 since it's a very compact phone with an impressive camera set and loaded with a good chipset. Slight caveat that battery time won't be as good, neither would be the user experience since andriod offers lots of experimental features. It has it's pros and cons. If I'll be upgrading to andriod, I'll probably go for OnePlus device.Very similar. I am mostly happy with my user experience with the same phone and think it was the right choice at the time. Have been looking around for an upgrade recently and am not impressed with the options available.

linux api compatibility layer for freedos?,"interesting information, thank you for your answerFrom my own experiments, using the network redirector interface, it certainly is possible to add a Unix like filesystem to DOS with a ""unix filesystem"" server and client application interacting locally to provide a Unix like file system layer. I can't remember the name of the application, but I remember reading, I think in Undocumented DOS Second Edition, that there was an application which did exactly that, in that it used drive U: as a ""redirector drive"" which exposed a unix-like filesystem for your system, to your system, so U:\ would be equivalent to /. Also, remember, DOS accepts pathnames using both \ and / path separators when calling the DOS API. Once you understand how DOS's filesystem works in DOS 3.1+, its actually fairly logical (so long as your pathnames arent too long). The above mentioned book is a good resource if you are interested.There's something for that actually, iirc it loads a linux kernel to do it?Can't recall the name, though.DJGPP, a port of the GNU compiler collection to 32-bit protected mode DOS, includes many traditional *nix tools. It is not a compatibility layer, however.I wonder how can I possibly install this over my freedos build with the aura m3 gui installed step-by-step.(I wonder if it can also run graphical applications too besides cli applications since I'm gonna be using it alongside the aura m3 gui)can you provide a tutorial please (if possible)?There's this, a ""DOS Subsystem for Linux"": https://github.com/haileys/doslinux",12,253,0.04743083,0.04743083,1,258,38.12,27.38,71.91,36.9,43,25.58,77.13,60.85,51.16,14.34,7.75,3.88,0,3.88,0,0,6.59,14.73,8.14,2.33,10.47,7.75,8.91,6.59,1.55,13.95,2.71,3.1,0.78,0,0.39,0.39,19.38,0,19.38,5.43,3.49,2.33,4.26,1.55,5.81,1.94,2.71,1.94,0.78,1.16,0.39,0.78,0,0,0,0,7.36,2.33,0.78,0.78,0,0,1.16,5.04,0,0,0,0,0.39,0,0,0.39,3.88,0,0,3.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.78,0,0,0,0,0.39,1.55,3.49,8.14,0.39,1.16,6.2,0.39,0,0,1.16,2.33,6.59,0.39,2.33,2.33,0,0,0,24.42,4.26,6.98,0.78,0,2.33,10.08,
productivity software: Microsoft 365 vs Google Workspace,"I must thank you for your very quick response. I am sorry, I missunderstood the subreddit's topic. I searched for one suited more about software but couldn t find a big one with many online members so i just shot my shot here. As for your questions:

-I have done 1-2 days research and didn t have any knowledge on it before.

-Thank you for the cost factor. Its very important.

-They gave me 3 days for this project. (i think its too little time)

-Yes i noticed that they want a PowerPoint presentation and i will also present it to them via Teams which shows that they like Microsoft.

Again, I am sorry for the misunderstanding of the subreddit and thank you for your answers!

FYI: My assignement is for tommorow.To be clear, this is an assignment to get you into school?

And they've giving you this imaginary prompt where you have to give a presentation on whether to go with Google Workspace or M365 for this made up company, and why?

What, very specific, questions do you have for us?

I can tell you all about both M365 and Google Workspace. But how much research into these two products have you done yourself?

If you were really doing this, asking others for their experiences is totally reasonable. But it's a pretty big topic.

I have chosen factors as security measurements, flexibility, rich features, easy collaboration on different projects as my main factors for my decision.

What about cost? This is a ""business"" right? Surely cost is a factor. You will need a masters in ""Microsoft's Bullshit Licensing"" just to start to figure that out.

If you are 100% strictly looking at the productivity tools (document processing, spreadsheets, presentation tool, etc.) that's way smaller than ""Microsoft 365"". Shoot, a few years ago that would have just been called ""office 365"".. but MS's naming conventions change constantly.

Is the company expecting to use the mail system associated with the respective productivity tools (e.g., Exchange Online and Gmail? Do they already have Exchange on-prem?).

Adopting M365 or Google Workpsace strictly based on the productivity tools would be a pretty wild notion honestly. I manage both... it's a borderline silly prompt.

If what they really just want is... compare and contrast these sets of tools, that's different.

Just curious:

How long have they given you to actually do this project? I ask because M365 is a beast. It's a bunch of different products glued together at the seems. And so much of it is nickle and dimed via convoluted licensing and naming conventions. If you know literally nothing about either, this is a bogus assignment. Or rather, I think you need to think about what they're really looking for because it's totally unreasonable to think that say in a few days somebody with no knowledge of these things can make actually provide an answer that's worth a damn.

P.S. have you noticed that they are asking you to submit this as a (Microsoft) Powerpoint presentation and not a presentation tool of your choosing?

Try NomadBSD or GhostBSD.This post shows a lack of understanding about how OSes and different architectures work. (think Cross-compiling or porting) The OS you want, did exist at one point. That said; bugs may exist in any hardware or software. The way to address this is to patch or rebuild. For end users, it's enough to submit a bug report. They had all of the great software ported and things just worked. TrueOS, previously PCBSD. Nothing more to see here.Probably your best bet. If it's good enough for God, it ought to be good enough for you too!Try TempleOS. If you want Linux apps to work, just rewrite them in HolyC. /sTroll much? :-) You really never tell us where these horrendous bugs are, just that you want to move. Obviously it can't be for gaming if you've considere Haiku. Maybe it's for a desktop experience? Can't say I've experienced any issues, maybe you should do some googling.If you can't get a Linux based OS to run smoothly, trying to run Linux apps on a non-Linux based system is just gonna be worse. It's proably a good idea if you want more bugs to work on to help upstream integration....but essentailly you will be going from baked in natuve support to not supported and hope for the best.

‘One of the most dangerous and irresponsible actions by a car company in decades’: Activist Ralph Nader urges regulators to recall Tesla's self-driving technology,"Tesla's autosteering features can only be enabled when conditions are favorable, but Tesla only releases data comparing autosteer usage to all driving conditions, not just conditions where autosteer can be enabled, so it's impossible to make a comparative analysis from Tesla's data. The NHTSA did release some data from Tesla, that made it possible to compare the collision rate from Model S drivers before autosteer was available to the collision rate after it was available, and there was an increase in collisions, but that is only useful for analyzing to the very first release of the feature, and it likely has improved since then, so we still don't have data on whether or not it's safer to use modern versions of the feature than to not use it.Do we have any good data on it's safety?  Is auto pilot less safe engaged with an at attention driver then not?  I feel like autopilot will need to be 3 - 5 times safer than not for people to think it's on par. with a human driver.  Isn't flying commercial something like a thousand times safer and yet people still have a fear of flying?GM made this guys life a living hell when he was fighting for seatbelts. People should look into the Facts of Nader v. GM if you want a wild read. Also the holding if you want to be depressed.He was a green party candidate. Nader, Jill Stein, Sinema. You get the picture.the green party tended to be trolling blowhards without an agenda.  The pushed Ralph Perogy to the moon but he didn't click, and he was great for shooting himself in the foot and being a jackass.Anybody who hates him is a DNC rube, plain and simple. He’s arguably the greatest consumer advocate ever, a fantastic writer and public speaker, an active community organizer well Into his old age, and a reminder that nothing is done in this country until it’s done. He’s a heroHe refused to withdraw in the 2000 election and it ended up that the razor-thin margins in FL, if you believe that Nader's green party votes would have gone Gore's way, would have swung the election to Gore instead of Bush. 22 years later, the reality is that Gore lost his home state, the Elian Gonzalez fiasco in Miami brought a lot of fence moderates into the Bush camp, and the Republicans simply had a better political machine set up in Florida.  Looking at this thru today's lens, if you put politics on a scale of 1 (most liberal) to 100 (Genghis Khan) Bush was about a 55 and Gore would have been about a 45.The 2000 election, he played spoiler and we got W Bush, which lead to tragedy and ruin.Some people hate him because some people believe when he ran for president in 2000 that he pulled enough votes away from Gore in Florida leading to Bush Jr. winning. However, the two actual reasons that Bush Jr. won are 1) a group of republicans (led by Roger Stone) staged a violent riot near a recount known as The Brooks Brothers Riot, which led to the recount being stopped due to fear and perceived pushback, and 2) the supreme court then handed the victory to Bush Jr. Most experts believe that, if a full recount had been conducted, Gore would've won: https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/31/politics/bush-gore-2000-election-results-studies/index.html Kinda went off on a tangent there. To summarize and reiterate: People mistakenly believe he caused Bush Jr. to win the presidency.Don't believe the rabble around elections. Yes that played a role but it's BS to pin the blame on him. Bush and the Republican party exploited the shills in Florida for that win. Nader is most famous for creating consumer protection since the 60s. He has gone after corporations, including the tobacco industry and car industry due to misleading and blatantly false advertising of their safety records. He's the reason we have seat belts in cars today. Can you imagine, with the number of car crashes we have today how many people would be dead? He's called corporations out on their bullshit and has basically been a pain in their ass preventing them from doing what they want to do, and forcing them to care about the consumers at least a little bit. Tl;dr He's the reason we have seat belts in cars. He's called corporations out on their bullshit and has basically been a pain in their ass preventing them from doing what they want to do, and forcing them to care about the consumers at least a little bit.So, I'm gonna be honest. I remember Nader, but didn't even know he was still alive or active. Can someone explain the hate for him?It's emphatically not self-driving... It's cruise control with extra steps. Other companies are making actual self driving cars that are safe and effective.He's saying that Tesla's is.Is he saying that self driving is unsafe at any speed?Possibly the reason you were born.Seatbelts guy to the rescue!Because of seat belts! [ needs source ]Thank you, came here to express my shock at this fact too.Who? Oh, yeah, fuck that guy!No lie I was curious about this a week ago, thank you universe for the answer.He complains about a car every 60 years or so.Didn't drive a Corvair, that's why.“We found your Prius…it was trying to vote for Ralph Nader”No kidding. But this is also the guy that got the Corvair off the road, so if anyone knows unsafe cars...He has a podcast and radio show.  He puts out a new episode every week and I find it to be one of the best by far for civic engagement.  Very few people are as great as him for consumer protection and citizen's rights.Nader is the wet blanket we all need but don’t know it. He’s done so much for this country for just being a single man it’s remarkable his name only seldom graces our lives, millions of which might as well be owed to his consumer protection efforts.

"“The challenge with our CO₂ emissions is that even if we get to zero, the world doesn’t cool back down."" Two companies are on a mission in Iceland to find a technological solution to the elusive problem of capturing and storing carbon dioxide","The question is where should the effort be out. Reduction or removal…or both. The weight of each effort makes a big difference.Lets do some math why this (and other ""CO capture plants"") are bullshit. This is the equivalent of the yearly emission of 9000 cars: https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle or ~5400 persons (living in the UK) per year: https://climate.selectra.com/en/news/co2-tree#planting-trees-to-tackle-climate-change But it fails of factor in the CO2 cost of building the plant, dismantling it, doing maintenance work and powering it.The article I linked above also mentions that a tree can contain around 167kg of CO2/year, so the equivalent is 216.000 trees. While this sounds a lot, its estimated that 1 square km contains around 50.000-100.000 trees: https://www.ran.org/the-understory/how_many_trees_are_cut_down_every_year/ so this means that one could achieve the same effect as this ""mammoth"" by planting around 3-5km2 of forest (1-2 square miles)While slashing emissions — and fast — is critical, it will not be enough to stabilise the climate. “We’re already at 1.2°C, 1.3°C today,” says  Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and one of the authors of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. “And we’re not going to be able to reduce emissions fast enough to avoid passing 1.5°C in the next few decades."" We're at a point where reduction is not enough anymore. We need to remove emissions as well. To be specific: The United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change (IPCC) says the use of carbon removal technologies is already “unavoidable” if we want to meet our climate goals, and that by 2050 we’ll need to remove and store 5-16 billion tons per year.

https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/05/1055322/we-need-to-draw-down-carbon-not-just-stop-emitting-it/ https://time.com/6197651/carbon-credits-fight-climate-change/Would even the most ambitious reforestation effort be sufficient?One thing to remember is the trees/sea plants being burnt as coal and oil that release all this CO2 are 100s of millions of years in the making. Reforestation is a band-aid and will take a lot of time to unfuck the situation. Humans gonna have to come up with some fancy technology for the problem that fancy technology got them intoOnly if you bury the trees.Not enough land in the world to plant enough trees to do the job. That is including the tundra and Antarctica too. The only solution is the over production of clean energy sources with tax money and using it capture the carbon. We are going to have to pay what should have been paid at the point of sale in the form of a carbon credit only later. There are other ways to capture carbon at scale and economically too but they just aren't enough to tackle the scale of the problem. That said, they should also be used to their fullest extent. These things aren't mutually exclusive.Yes but we need more than trees.The Amazon has 390b trees. 17% of the Amazon has been cut down. So 66,300,000.000 trees. We just need to replant those treees. The universe already figured out how to decrease local entropy using the least amount of energy. All we have to do is do that….again.As a long term solution, restoring the natural flora and fauna along with the former forests have enormous benefits, bot for nature, animals, and generally climate, since forests do reduce effects and chances of some natural disasters, like flooding, and small floods could be completely negated depending on cause.
Along with the animals coming back, there are plenty of animals in the yellow or red who would be less at risk if they are more habitat to live in.
If every person in america planted one tree per year for 5 years, in a ok to good location, it would only need to happen for 4 years, to reforest more then was cut down.Regreening in general is the only way forwardWell… Sure, I guess… But how are we gonna rope in investors for our environmentally-friendly Web3 blockchain startup? Trees don’t sound very tech-y.Trees work. And young trees suck up more carbon as they grow compared to mature trees. But trees don't work everywhere. A much bigger carbon sink are peatlands. Boggy swamplands which often got drained to support cattle. The stored carbon in the form of peat starts rotting and releasing CO2 instead of absorbing it. But restoring peatlands is not popular as they're not pretty per se and too much money is being made by keeping it dead and covered. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00355-3Forests take too long and are vulnerable to wildfires and droughts. Personally I like kelp better - no inputs required, grows 2 ft a day. A cultivation area the size of California (yes, 420,000 sq km) would be enough to suck up global emissions by 80%. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PECyAWqTgtc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1vlolzaus Edit 1: 420,000 sq km is HUGE but distributed across the eligible coasts, then it's not so large. Above 500,000 sq km and we start reducing CO2 in the atmosphere. Edit 2: in North America, kelp farming is in the embryo stage, just like solar 30 years ago. And we can grow other stuff with kelp too, plus reverse ocean acidification, restore local marine wildlife and ecosystems. With the right incentives, this could be huge. Edit 3: if we can engineer kelp just like we did to wheat, then who knows - 3 feet of growth a day???Could efforts toward reforestation aid in this?  Plants love CO2 and we love the O2 they give us in return.The following submission statement was provided by /u/climeworks: While slashing emissions — and fast — is critical, it will not be enough to stabilise the climate. “We’r already at 1.2°C, 1.3°C today,” says  Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and one of the authors of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. “And we’re not going to be able to reduce emissions fast enough to avoid passing 1.5°C in the next few decades.""

"""Licence Key Invalid"" - Except it's not.","Hello,



	I just got notified by someone on my site's Discord server that my site was down, they were waiting for it to come back online, and wanted to know when it was coming back. I told them that there was no planned downtime. So I go onto the site, and find ""Licence Key Invalid"", and that there was a problem with my licence key and I needed to check it. It also told me that my community was offline and I noticed all my plugins and applications were completely disabled as well. The nearest I can tell that it went down was sometime between 12:40 and 12:43 BST, today.



	Problem with that: My licence key is valid. I'm not sure why it said that it wasn't. I also don't appreciate it completely disabling my website (Turning it offline) when I am a VALID licence key holder. I also don't like how it completely messes up settings either; such as the custom directories in the upload settings. For example I have my gallery images pointing to a specific place, that this changes and sets back to default after I reconfirm my licence key.



	I'm not sure if this is a bug or anything, or if it's intentional. But this is very annoying and not the first time this has happened. Especially not getting any form of notification about it from the site itself. I will not be very happy if this is intentional as this is affecting legitimate people and the consequences seem severe as well.



			
				


	Edited August 18 by Tripp★I need to clarify before anything else here, we do not disable or switch off your site when your key shows as invalid. Not in any way at all. We would also not change any settings in any way for any other reason, unless you are running an upgrade and it tells you as much.



	Given the above, there is something that has happened on your server to cause this, which you will need to trace down. From what you have said, this sounds very much like someone has been messing in your admin CP, or on your database. So I would track those first of all. 



	The license key issue is likely due to not being able to contact the license server at the time. That would simply need a refresh, and would only remove that message, and enable you to do things such as access marketplace, and run the spam service and run upgrades. Nothing else in any way is affected by this.

	I have been able to set the site back to online mode and change the settings back, yes. But this is not the first time that this has happened.



	So the community gets set to ""Offline Mode"" and all my plugins and applications appear to get disabled, and as far as I am aware the upload settings (As I described) get set back to default. When I, as an Admin, comes onto the site, I can see the community, and see in the title bar that it's set to ""(Offline) Site name"" and all the plugins and applications are disabled as things don't appear where they should. 



	I click on the message and go to the ACP, log in and ""Recache"" my license key and that's it. Everything is back online, I need to go and modify the settings afterwards to make sure that I'm good but other than that, I don't need to bring any of the plugins or applications online, or set the community as being online, it seems to do all of that automatically when I recache the license key.



	That seems to me like a designed feature.



	I will also add: No one has logged into the ACP other than me, which was after this had happened, and I find it extremely unlikely that someone was able to manipulate the database. I am the only one with access to that, and if you're going at it through Cpanel you need a really long complicated password with non-ASNI standard characters and 2FA. I also get emails when someone logs into this. I also get emails when someone accesses the server via SSH. However I am going to download and review my server logs. 



	Is there any possibility that a ""rogue plugin"" or a ""rogue application"" can do this if it detects that IPS doesn't appear to have a valid licence key? Because if you say this can't happen, and if my logs are telling me that there was no breach then something has to have caused this.

Additional paragraph. And a question.There is certainly a possibility that 3rd party code could do that, yes.

	This is highly concerning that a plugin or application can have that level of control over the entire community in that way. Is there anything I can to do try and track down which one might be causing this? Such as being able to replicate it in a controlled fashion so I can go through each plugin and application one by one to find out which is actually doing this? 



	I know IPS have some strict rules on what is and isn't allowed in terms of marketplace applications, at least from what I've heard from other third-party developers. So my next question is: Is this even allowed in the first place?

	This would mean you have some caching on the server. If there is anything further, this may also be complicating it.

	It is certainly something that is frowned upon now and not allowed. However, if you have custom or older applications/plugins installed, this would not be covered under reviews.

	Here's the thing... I think all of my plugins and applications come from the IPS Marketplace, installed through my ACP. None of it's custom, and I think the older stuff probably wouldn't work by this point so has been updated or removed, long ago.

	Damn it. I was hoping that I'd be able somehow reproduce it and start adding mods and such to it... Perhaps I can use my test install and change the licence key after install to one that is invalid so I can do this test. Add an app - change the key? If the site doesn't go offline, change it back to what it should be and repeat? Could I do that? 



	Also, I take it that I can't just download my /applications and /plugins folder and load it all up in Visual Studio Code and go through it looking specifically for things that mention things like ""\IPS\IPS::licenseKey()"" for example?On 8/18/2022 at 2:47 PM,   Tripp★ said:

	As long as you are self-hosted that's an option. You can download the folders and check for specific code like licenseKey() or to see if there's code that switches the offline setting.



	 



	If you're unsure of what to search, or how, it's also possible to hire a 3rd party developer to review the code of all your apps. A list of developers available for hire can be found here: https://invisioncommunity.com/third-party/providers/

	Okay, so I found a way of manually triggering an ""Invalid Licence Key"" thing to show up on my test install. I can confirm that this is not something that seems to come with the vanilla software (IPS Suite on it's own), and so I want to apologise for my accusation, so I apologise, Marc.

	So the order of the replies are switched.



	 



	Anyway, the June 17 reply (opening post of the thread) should not get here at all. Even if this was the only thread of the club (which is not the case), I should see the 7 other replies in chronological order before the opening post of the thread (which is the oldest post of the thread of course). So in a club where there is only  one thread, the opening post of a thread with 8 replies should be in 8th position in the block.

"""Too many redirects""","Sometime between 9am and 10am (UK time) today, our self-hosted forum stopped working - https://www.zero88.com/forum/



	I’ve checked with multiple people and it’s down for all of them.



	We get a ""too many redirects"" error.



	The rest of the website (non-Invision forum) is working fine.



	There have been no changes to our server settings or forum settings today (or for quite a while previously)



	The SSL certificates are in date.



	When my IP address tries to access the forum, the server logs show 10x “301 GET /forum/ HTTP/1.0”



	However, from the server logs, it appears that other IP addresses are successfully accessing the forum (logs show specific pages with code “200”) – I just don’t know how or who.



	I'm a little lost as to where to start diagnosing thisFirst of all I would think to yourself, regardless of whether you believe something to have changed, something must have indeed changed. So it's a case of tracking down what that change is. The first thing I would do in order to check this would be to rename any htaccess files outside of your community directory, just temporarily to see if your site loads. This would be the most common cause of issues like theseThanks Marc,



	I've previously attempted removing .htaccess from the /forum directory, and the parent / directory, with no sucsess. I've just doubled checked by renaming, and still not fixed.



	One thought of something that has changed... today all our social channels were shutdown (part of a transition to our ""parents"" social channel). I don't remember any tie-in more than a simple URL link.I noticed you are using http on your license yet there is redirection to https. I suspect this may be your issue. Are you forcing https on the server? If so, you need to ensure you have changed your conf_global.php file to reflect that change$INFO['board_url']			=	'https://zero88.com/forum';


	This is already set within conf_global.php



	I noticed in the client area that our licence was only http, but didn't want to change it just to ""test"" as I wouldn't be able to change it back... and I'm guessing the licence within the clientarea wouldn't in itself cause this issue.Please update your access details on file to correct the sftp location for your files. This appears to be incorrect at presentHi Marc,



	I just tried changing:


https://zero88.com/forum


	to



	 


https://www.zero88.com/forum


	and that appears to have fixed the issue.



	That file hasn't been changed, and the forum software hasn't been updated (it's on the to-do list!). What would have caused that setting to to create a problem like this?only the server redirecting from one to the other. So the server will have been redirecting from non www to www, and the software will have been doing the opposite. So something on the server has changed there.On 8/30/2022 at 2:49 PM,   Marc Stridgen said:

	https://zero88.com/forum/applications/core/interface/font/fontawesome-webfont.ttf?v=4.7.0



	In the template, this is just listed as:


href=""{url=""applications/core/interface/font/fontawesome-webfont.woff2?v=4.7.0""


	How do I change where this is pointing? The only place I can find the URL within the AdminCP is within the licence. In the client area, I can't change the URL to include ""www"", as it says ""There seems to still be an installation of Invision Community at the URL on file. Before you can change the URL, you must first remove the existing installation.""

If you also want to remove files ignored by git, then execute the following command.

http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clean.html


-x means ignored files are also removed as well as files unknown to git.
-d means remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. 
-f is required to force it to run.Warning: This will delete the local files that are not indexed


Just force it : git checkout -f another-branchIt seems like you want the files ignored but they have already been commited. .gitignore has no effect on files that are already in the repo so they need to be removed with git rm --cached. The --cached will prevent it from having any effect on your working copy and it will just mark as removed the next time you commit. After the files are removed from the repo then the .gitignore will prevent them from being added again.

But you have another problem with your .gitignore, you are excessively using wildcards and its causing it to match less than you expect it to. Instead lets change the .gitignore and try this.

.bundle
.DS_Store
db/*.sqlite3
log/*.log
tmp/
public/system/images/
public/system/avatars/If you're on OS X, it may be because a file's name has had certain characters change case. Try setting the following config option:

git config core.ignorecase trueThis worked for me.

 1. git fetch --all
 2. git reset --hard origin/{branch_name}Git is telling you that it wants to create files (named public/system/images/9/... etc), but you already have existing files in that directory that aren't tracked by Git. Perhaps somebody else added those files to the Git repository, and this is the first time you have switched to that branch?

There's probably a reason why those files in your develop branch but not in your current branch. You may have to ask your collaborators why that is.


  how do I get this working so I can switch branches without deleting those files?


You can't do it without making the files disappear somehow. You could rename public to my_public or something for now.


  if I came back to this branch afterwards would everything be perfect as up to my latest commit?


If you commit your changes, Git won't lose them. If you don't commit your changes, then Git will try really hard not to overwrite work that you have done. That's what Git is warning you about in the first instance here (when you tried to switch branches).There is a command for this delicate task (permanently deleting untracked files)

git clean -i


Then git pull will do.These two functions


git rm --cached
git checkout -f another-branch  


did NOT work for me.

Instead, I physically removed the file (in eclipse) as what Git tells you to do; 

Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.


and then I add/committed it.

and then I pulled and it worked!For those who need something less far-reaching than Scott Schafer’s answer,

git clean -f


will likely work. I highly suggest running

git clean --dry-run


first. That command will output a list of files that Git will remove if you run git clean -f, and might save you the pain of inadvertently removing something you didn’t want to.

See this Stack Oveflow answer or the docs for more information on git clean.Unfortunately neither git rm --cached or git clean  -d  -fx """" did it for me.

My solution ended up being pushing my branch to remote, cloning a new repo, then doing my merge in the new repo. Other people accessing the repo had to do the same.

Moral of the story: use a .gitignore file from inception.If you want to quickly resolve this question,You can use this command:

git checkout -f devI had the same problem when checking out to a branch based on an earlier commit. Git refused to checkout because of untracked files.

I've found a solution and I hope it will help you too.

Adding the affected directories to .gitignore and issuing $ git rm -r --cached on them is apparently not enough. 

Assume you want to make a branch based an earlier commit K to test some stuff and come back to the current version. I would do it in the following steps:


Setup the untracked files: 
edit the .gitignore and apply $ git rm -r --cached on the files and directories you want the git to ignore. Add also the file .gitignore itself to .gitignoreand don't forget to issue $ git rm -r --cached .gitignore. This will ensure the the ignore behavior of git leaves the same in the earlier commits.
Commit the changes you just made:

$ git add -A
$ git commit

Save the current log, otherwise you may get problems coming back to the current version

$ git log > ../git.log
Hard reset to the commit K 

$ git reset --hard version_k
Create a branch based on the commit K

$ git branch commit_k_branch
Checkout into that branch

$ git checkout commit_k_branch    
Do your stuff and commit it
Checkout back into master again

$ git checkout master
Reset to the current Version again

$ git reset current_version or $ git reset ORIG_HEAD
Now you can reset hard to the HEAD

git reset --hard HEAD


NOTE! Do not skip the next-to-last step (like e. g. $ git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
) otherwise the untracked files git complained above will get lost.

I also made sure the files git complained about were not deleted. I copied them to a text-file and issued the command $ for i in $(cat ../test.txt); do ls -ahl $i; done

If you checkout to the branch mentioned above again, do not forget to issue $ git status to ensure no unwanted changes appear.This happened to me on a Windows 8 system, using Git from the command prompt.  The rest of my team uses TFS, and I use Microsoft's git-tf to push/pull between TFS and my local Git repository.

The problem arose due to some files that had been renamed only to change their case.  What appears to have happened was this:


The files were checked in with mixed casing in their names.
In a later commit, the file names were changed to all lower-case.
git-tf initially got the files in mixed case.
When the files were renamed to lower-case, git-tf didn't get the files because to Windows 8 those file names are equivalent.
Since Git is case-sensitive, it complained that I had the mixed-case files that weren't in source control.  But using git status, I couldn't see any changes, since in the Windows command prompt those file names are equivalent.


The simplest solution for me was:


git checkout a previous version of the project, well before those files were ever added.
Then git checkout the latest version of the project, with the correct file casing.In my case, the problem was with the submodules. master was merged with another branch which added a new submodule to the project. The branch I was trying to checkout didn't have it, that's why git was complaining about untracked files and none of the other suggested solutions worked for me. I forced the checkout to my new branch, and pulled master.


git checkout -f my_branch
git pull origin master
git submodule update --initthis commands solved my problem:
git add * 
git stash
git pullIn my case git rm --cached didn't work.
But i got it with a git rebaseI was also facing a similar issue and i tried all the solutions posted above but it didn't work

The issue was caused when i renamed my onMusicUpdateListener.java to OnMusicUpdateListener.java in develop branch. 

Now master had onMusicUpdateListener.java
and develop had the same file as OnMusicUpdateListener.java

Now whenever i switched to master it gave me an error

The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout


and then it aborted.

In order to solve this, i forcefully checked out master branch
and then renamed my onMusicUpdateListener.java to OnMusicUpdateListener.java, committed it and then merged it with develop branch.

Then i updated my develop branch by merging it into master and now everything is back to normal and problem is solved.that's easy to solve, git is saying that you have the same files in both branches, therefore you have to delete the specific files from master branch and then you will be able to merge:

git merge ""your branch""


I hope it works for you, I just solved my error.
my error was:

error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
        .vs/slnx.sqlite
Please move or remove them before you merge.
Aborting


Now it is working!
In my case .vs/slnx.sqlite was generated by visual studio, I needed to close it before delete it.This could be a permission issue,

change the ownership,

sudo chown -v -R usr-name:group-name folder-name2 files with the same name but different case might be the issue.

You can Delete one on these files or rename it. Ex:

Pdf.html.twig (The GOOD one)

pdf.html.twig (The one I deleted)Move files, instead of delete

One way of avoiding deleting files is to move them instead. For example:

cd ""`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`""
git checkout 2>&1 | while read f; do [ ! -e ""$f"" ] || mv ""$f"" ""$f"".bak; doneIf you have renamed a file locally and then do a pull, it will display that error message.In my case, I was seeing this error because I am using a popular open source CMS and the directory which was causing issues was the uploads directory which the CMS writes to.

So what it was saying is that there are files which you don't have, but which you can't get from versioning.

I'm grabbing all the files from the live site to my local, then I'll check this into the repo in the hope that this fixes the issue.Delete .gitignore file from appname/gen/ to solve this issue.I just went to the file system and deleted the file directly, then continued with git checkout and it worked.

I've had the problem occur several times and it may be related to developers doing delete, push, re-add, push or some such thing.Most of the answers consider deleting or removing the files, which is the easy way. But sometimes you don't want to get rid of the local files. But merge with a strategy, so git has solution for this too ;

git merge --strategy=ours masterJust delete the files or rename them.

e.g. 

$ git pull
Enter passphrase for key '/c/Users/PC983/.ssh/id_rsa':
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
        ajax/productPrice.php
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
        ajax/product.php
Please move or remove them before you merge.
Aborting
Updating a04cbe7a..6aa8ead5


I had to rename/delete ajax/product.php and ajax/produtPrice.php.

Don't worry, git pull will bring them back. I suggest you to rename them instead of deleting, because you might loose some changes.

If this does not help, then you have to delete the whole Branch and create it again and then do git pull origin remotebranchIn order to save the modified files and to use the modified content later.
I found this error while i try checking out a branch and when trying to rebase.
Try Git stash 

git stashCheck if any folder name having '/' or any special symbol then rename that folders.
Then you just clone the repository to another location.A simple solution might be: 
Just make sure that you are in the correct working directory in GitBash.
That Message occure almost every time if a User tries to merge a directory too high in his folder hierarchy. 

Example:

/workspace/git/myBashSourceFolder/myProjectSourcefolder


Scenario:
User cloned repo in git-folder he created a new Java Project in Eclipse, imported the cloned repo. Eclipse set myProjectSourceFolder as Source Folder in his local Project. therefore the User entered it in git bash and pushed, pulled and commited his project from there. git syncs therefore myProjectSourceFolder - but has no record in his history for myBashSourceFolder. Therefore a push / pull /merge from myBashSourceFolder will produce the given output, if User tries to sync from there next time, instead of the folder he worked before.


  Solution: Enter correct Folder and try a pull again. In almost every
  time I encountered, this solution worked fine :)",,,,,1,2277,47.35,21.94,57.71,27.81,22.11,17.48,76.15,63.99,49.06,13.48,7.73,3.82,0.09,2.77,0.26,0.75,5.75,13.04,6.46,1.01,10.36,8.26,4.3,6.72,1.49,18.58,4.83,2.06,4.22,0.26,2.64,1.32,14.71,0.7,13.97,1.84,2.85,1.98,2.77,0.13,5.49,0.09,2.24,1.41,0.83,0.57,0.22,0.35,0.04,0,0.04,0,7.03,2.55,0.31,0.18,0.22,0.04,1.36,4.48,0,0,0,0.26,0.44,0,0,0.44,2.85,0.04,0.13,2.64,0.04,0,0.4,0.09,0.04,0,0,0,0,0.04,0,0.61,0.61,0.7,0.26,0.04,0,0,0.44,0.18,4.22,6.85,0.79,1.62,3.6,0.48,0,0.44,5.05,4.83,3.78,1.84,0.66,0.66,0.26,0,0,22.92,7.11,2.72,0.26,0.31,1.67,10.85,

	In our database the event start date is correctly(?) stored in UTC



	


	 



	The issue: In the upcoming events block the event disappears at 16:00:00 client time, regardless of the client's timezone - i.e. my computer is set to Europe/Berlin time and the event is only visible until 16:00 local time although it starts at 18:00 local time.



	When I change my computer's timezone to UTC the block works as expected.What the block shows is based on UTC time. So 'today' would be 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTCI'm not talking about the date/time that is shown, it's correct. The event disappears before it has started. I have to change my computer's timezone to UTC to make it work.

4.6: How to restore custom member titles,"Invision Community 4.6 brings a brand new achievements system which overhauls the ranks system along with adding the ability to earn points which translates into a higher rank via rules.



	As part of the clean-up, we removed the custom member title from the author section of the post as there's a limit to how much information we can show comfortably!



	Of course, some communities used custom member titles and wish to continue using them. Fortunately it's easy enough to get them back.

Step 1: Log into the ACP and navigate to Members > Profiles > Profile Fields



	Step 2: You will see a group called ""Retained"", inside is a new custom field called ""Member Title"". This profile field was used in the upgrade to save the custom member title data. Click on the pencil icon to edit.



	

Step 3: Post upgrade, this field is effectively switched off, but it can easily be switched back on. For the ""Display format for topics"" choose custom and just use: {$content} as the value. This will remove the ""Member Title:"" prefix. Save the changes.



	


	You will now see the member title has been restored.



	

 Advanced tip:  Only do this if you are comfortable making theme edits! If it all goes wrong, don't panic. There is a revert button to undo your changes! Edit the template bit Forums > topics > postContainer in your active theme and move the block highlighted here up underneath the {{endif}} of the {{$comment->isAnonymous()}} block.I appreciate the guide and that means I can get it back under the username by placing it under


<ul class='cAuthorPane_info ipsList_reset'>


	but because I show Location as well, it's moving that with it to a place I don't want it to show.



	I still think more options on the ranks would be best all round, with a few minor changes it could work like the old system did. You only need to make it so the title can be editable, and a choice to show the rank image or rank text on topics then they'd be no need for the old member title being retained.



			
				


	Edited July 1, 2021 by marklcfcQuestion--Does this work if Achievements is disabled as I am not seeing the Member title or is it because I am doing this on my test board and I had no previous member titles and I can't create a new one?

	+1 on this. My community uses custom titles to communicate developer roles, but we also show several other custom fields underneath. It would be brilliant to be able to move custom fields individually rather than move the whole block of them at once.



	 



	I appreciate the guide though @Matt. Cheers!Thanks for the guide! Is there a way to display the $rank->_title OR the member title? It seems the profile fields have no ""name"" to be directly referenced in the template to create some if else magic 🤔On 7/1/2021 at 3:00 PM,   OWA said:

	Surely there has to be a way to move just the member title, but leave the other profile fields (Location in my case) where they are



			
				


	Edited July 3, 2021 by marklcfcHi @Matt 

	I've followed along with the guide and it seems to only show the titles (on ""content submissions) to staff, regardless of the option chosen. 

	Also, as you can see in the screenshots, I've moved the title upwards in the block, can you tell me where I need to put the css text in order for it to show directly under the username?



	Thanks. Below are screenshots of the issue.



	The Option + Formatting setting:




	 



	Admin view (With title outlined):



	 



	Regular member view:That could be a bug, please submit a ticket and we will take a look.Sure thing. Will do.Any way to just move member title under the username @Matt, I can do it your way but it takes Location with it which clearly isn't needed that high up.



			
				


	Edited July 5, 2021 by marklcfcUse at your own risk...



	This requires that you know the ID number of your custom profile field so go to the profile fields listing, hover the mouse over the button for editing and look at the number at the end of the URL:



	


	So the above is 1, it will be used in the locations below where compared to $test



	Edit core -> front -> global -> customFieldsDisplay



	After:


{{foreach $fields as $field => $value}}


	Add


{{$test = (int) str_replace('core_pfield_','',$field);}}
{{if $test != '1'}}


	After:


</li>


	Add:


{{endif}}


	Edit forums > front -> topics -> postContainer



	Before:


{{if $comment->author()->member_id}}


	Add:


{{foreach $comment->author()->contentProfileFields() as $group => $fields}}
    {{foreach $fields as $field => $value}}
    {{$test = (int) str_replace('core_pfield_','',$field);}}
    {{if $test == '1'}}

	This is not something that would be re-added for the reason mentioned in the original post.

4.7 manual upgrade - issue,"Hi there,



	Just to notify the team. When performing an upgrade of my community (self hosted) from  4.5x to 4.7.0, the automatic upgrade failed and it prompted me to upgrade manually. I followed the installation guide to complete the manual upgrade, downloading the 4.7 installation files from my client area and uploading my files over FTP successfully. However when I visited admin/upgrade I was prompted that there was an issue with the following file not being correct:



	[root]/community/applications/core/modules/admin/system/upgrade.php



	It stated that the file was not for the correct version, or the permissions were not correct. However after double checking permissions, redownloading and reuploading this file, I could see the error was with the file actually provided for download in the client area.



	Thankfully an auto install worked correctly on my staging site and I could then see a difference in the files:
staging site: 56016 bytes
downloaded file: 56116 bytes



	So after copying that file from my staging site over, the upgrade completed successfully.



	Just want to avoid other users facing the same issue.Yeah, it's a known issue. Since it's a weekend and no developers are around it will be fixed tomorrow most likely:The upgrade.php file is not recognized as from 4.7 from the manual download. I had to copy from another site that went through ACP upgrade successfully and copied the file. All worked after that.I have the same problem. Spent hours today trying to get the upgrade working, with no success.



	How do I get the correct upgrade.php file to complete this upgrade?

I have entered the info as requested as I am a self hosted client. What else do I need to do at this point?Unfortunately, a 503 Server Error is an issue with your server or underlying hosting. You would need to work with your hosting provider to determine the cause here. If there are any errors with our software which we can provide assistance with, please let us know.Hi Jim,



	So apparently the php in the folder the forums are in when haywire and they had to restart it to get it to stop. SO now I can get to the index page and admin but if I click on any of our links I get:



	Not Found



	The requested URL was not found on this server.



	Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.



	... nothing has been deleted that Im aware of but Im not sure how to proceed.That error indicates you don't an .htaccess file in place but have enabled Friendly URL's with URL rewrites.



	You can download a new htaccess file in the ACP on the Site Promotion -> Search Engine Optimization page.



	Upload that file, making sure it is named .htaccess (note the leading period).



	That should get the Friendly URL's working again, but if that fails please let us know.That did it. Thank you. Any idea why my php went crazy on the forums folder so I can avoid this again?Since we don't host your site, we really can't know what went wrong. That's something you'd need to ask your host.

	Hi @Jim M I'm getting the same errors again. Can't load the website and today is a busy day with big news for the Angels, so this is quite frustrating.It does seem there were a couple of instances of this, both of which happened to affect you there. Please let us know if this happens again, but Im not seeing any issues at presentHi everyone, this issue is back again. Can we see about fixing this for good? I've seen this happen more recently than ever before, which is concerning. Looks like the root issue causing this has yet to be resolved. While it doesn't last terribly long (anywhere from 1-5 minutes), all it takes is one new visitor to see that and not want to come back since we're not stable.Very sorry to hear you are seeing this again. We are working on some things in the background at present which I suspect may have caused this. We should have this resolved as soon as possible.Happened again tonight.

A completely free agile software process tool [closed],"Questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, library or favorite off-site resource are off-topic for Stack Overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it. Closed 8 years ago. I know slightly close questions have been asked before but this question is a bit different. We are a start-up company with a very limited budget and we are looking for a completely free Agile software development process tool without any limitation on the number of users. We don't want to have a limitation for the number of users because there could be a lot of people who would do small tasks for us and if they pass the number of user limit all of a sudden we'll have to pay a lot of money for the tool monthly. It would be very useful if it could support: I have checked a lot of those tools here: http://agilescout.com/best-agile-scrum-tools/ but I didn't find any that is absolutely free for unlimited users. Some of them also don't have a Kanban board. I checked Agilefant but its online version is going to be paid from 2014. I also checked Stackoverflow for this but none of the questions were targeting ""completely free tools"". Your help will be greatly appreciated.Trello.com  Trello is free for unlimited users.  Period.  

You almost definitely don't need ""Sub-cards"".  Use the checklists instead, or if you REALLY need sub-cards, don't have a parent sub-card.  Just name the tickets something like ""Epic - Story A"" or ""Story - task Z"" or whatever.  

Another idea is to create two boards (did I mention you can have unlimited boards for free too?). One for your epics and one for your stories.  Call one your product management board and the other your sprint board, or whatever you like.  

I'm not sure what you need different roles for - but, people aren't crazy - they know their job.  As a startup if you already have problems getting people to not do crazy things (Where you need to restrict their permissions) you have much much bigger issues.

The point is that you need a SMALL tool to help you track stuff.  Not a super rigid tool that makes you work in a super specific way.  As a new (I assume?) startup, you should let your process grow into a tool.  Don't beef up your process to fit a tool.Back in 2010 we had the same problem and i successfully employed GoogleDocs with our small Agile Development team (8 Devs in 3 Countries).

GoogleDrawing will serve in the exact same way as a physical Scrum board would, with all the upsides of full flexibilty and also the downsides of zero automation but with the big additional upside of being virtual and accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

It also was used for the retrospective at the end of each Sprint

GoogleSpreadsheet was used for a concise list of all the tickets from our bug tracking system (Redmine, manually transfered) and also for the (manually updated, albeit with formulas to calculate the progress) burndown chart.

The combination of these different elements is actually quite powerful, as you have the full flexibility over the content and its representation and can have your team communicate via VoIP while all are looking at the same documents and can modify them in real-time.

Here an example of the docs used in a sprint (all sensitive data removed):


Scrum board Example (GoogleDrawing)
Retrospective Example (GoogleDrawing)
Burndown Chart Example (GoogleSheet, formulas to automate calculation)
Ticket list from Bugtracker (GoogleSheet)


As mentioned before, the only downside is the fact that you have to invest some time to maintain and prepare the data for each sprint, but for us that was hugely outweighed by the flexibility and accessibility that the Team of GoogleDocs + VoIP gave us.You can check out https://kanbanflow.com
It's free for now because it's in beta and they say there is no time limit.  It behaves very similar to AgileZen

I second the google doc, or you could use an online collaborative board that multiple people can edit.

Or you can host a more robust excel doc in skydrive from MS.  I haven't tried that yet.

Mura.ly is another one that I am playing with currently.  It has unlimited collaborators, though I think you would probably have to invite them everytime?? with a free account.

Hope that helps!Try http://www.icescrum.org . It is free to use. And it has lot of cool features. Perfect for scrum teams.EDIT: Kanbanize is a commercial product and offers a 30 day free trial.

Disclosing: I am a co-founder of http://kanbanize.com/

Mark, I understand your desire to find the perfect application with all these features inside, but I really doubt that you will get it for free. There's a bunch of super cool apps (including Kanbanize) out there, but none of them is completely free.

Be careful what you call a Kanban board and what not, though. Trello is definitely NOT a kanban system (no WIP limits, no analytics, etc.). It is a great visual management system, but not a Kanban one.

Finally, to answer your question, tools that deserve attention in my opinion are:
Kanbanize (of course), LeanKit, KanbanTool, Kanbanery and probably a few others. My personal bias is that LeanKit is the most advanced to date followed by Kanbanize and KanbanTool.

I hope that helps.One possibility would be to use a Google Drawing, part of Google Drive, if you want a more visual and easy-to-edit option. You can create the cards by grouping a color-filled rectangle and one or more text fields together. Being a sufficiently free-form online vector drawing program, it doesn't really limit your possibilities like if you use a more dedicated solution.

The only real downsides are that you have to first create the building blocks from the beginning, and don't get numerical statistics like with a more structured tool.Although, I'm a big fan of Kanban Tool service (it has everything you need except free of charge) and therefore it's difficult for me to stay objective, I think that should go for Trello or Kanban Flow.

A license free for free software but a fee for commercial software? [closed]," This question does not appear to be about programming within the scope defined in the help center. Closed 7 years ago. I am looking for a license that allows developers who release their software freely/non-commercially use my software without any cost, but those who releases commercial software needs to buy a license. I've been looking at the GNU licenses but they all seem to be free for both commercial and non-commercial use. What are the commonly used licenses in my case?There can be no general answer to your question, you either do this by creating your own software license (which can not be free as in The Free Software Definition because you restrict commercial use) or you can try to achieve something similar with dual licensing as following:

The public and freely available software is available under a free software license with strong copyleft like the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). Any entity making use of the software must publish the source and changes to all it's users under the same license (reciprocal, ASP loophole closed).

You can even make the software practicable incompatible with mostly any open source software by choosing the Open Software License (OSL). It's incompatible in this sense with most of the existing open source software (first hand GPL which covers the largest share of open source code, but also many others) and has strong copyleft by usage (communication of the work even), so it's pretty limiting.

You would actually signal: don't use the free version - a somewhat morally questionable move.

As (and if) this is not fitting for the type of commercial use you ask about, then you can offer a second license for commercial use. If someone complains you can just tell them, hey it's free software. Bad move, but probably working. Ask your lawyer for the details, this variant might not be what you're looking for, you won't do the free software community a favor.

Instead you need to find out what you actually want to do. Restrict commercial use or not. After you've done that, talk with a lawyer to create a fitting software license for your work.",,,,,1,359,53.76,55,16.77,59.56,22.44,25.07,87.19,71.31,53.76,12.81,7.24,1.11,0,4.74,0,0.84,5.57,15.04,7.52,0.84,12.81,9.47,5.01,6.13,2.23,19.22,9.47,3.06,5.01,0.84,1.95,2.23,21.45,0.84,20.61,2.51,5.01,3.34,4.74,0.56,6.13,0,4.18,3.34,0.84,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,11.98,4.74,0.84,0,0.28,0.28,2.79,7.24,0,0,0,0,4.18,0,0,4.18,4.18,0,0,2.23,1.95,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.84,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.67,6.41,7.24,1.11,0.56,4.46,1.67,0,0.28,1.39,2.23,5.29,0.56,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,15.88,4.46,3.06,0.28,0,2.51,5.57,
A test installation has already been activated for this license key.,"Testing out the latest version of IC using the -TESTINSTALL license. My first try to install the software failed and I wanted to try again by first blowing away the database and file system. On the second go around, I am getting this error: A test installation has already been activated for this license key. Your license key entitles you to one test installation only.Removing the instance would not remove the set URL. You should install in the same location as preivously. If you need to change that location, please let us knowI am installing to the same server (hostname localhost), same IP (public IP), same webserver (apache2), same SQL location (localhost). The differences are a different SQL login, different filesystem path (var/www/html/ is the same, different subdirectory).

	If this is a localhost install (on your PC/Mac) for testing, then don't use -TESTINSTALL - it's not required for localhost installations.



	It is required for publicly facing test installations



			
				


	Edited August 11 by Nathan ExplosionThis is one of those situations where what I am asking for is simple, but explaining it is hard.



	short version: I need to reset/delete the TESTINSTALL URL/link/whatever you call it so I can install a test instance. I've already asked for that, and I am still asking for that.



	longer version: My first virtual server, let's call it host A, runs Debian, has a public IP starting with 66. and has the hostname localhost. IC has been installed there forever and runs fine though it is very out of date. I can't upgrade it without upgrading Python. I've tried once and blew up the server which necessitated restoring from a backup. Not wanting to go down that path again, I built a new virtual server, host B, this time with Ubuntu, a public IP starting with 45., and also has the hostname localhost. I installed a fresh webserver, mySQL instance, created a DB and a user, granted rights, and extracted a new copy of the latest IC in the directory /var/www/html/ips-ce/. The install crashed after accepting the -TESTINSTALL serial. I assume it was building/populating the DB when it crashed. I didn't find anything useful in the syslog, the mySQL log, or the Apache log. So, wanting to try again, I below away the DB, DB user, and deleted /var/www/html/ips-ce. When I tried to install again, I am greeted with two error:



	



	



	So, I cannot install a 2nd copy of IC on host B. I'd like to, so that I can test migrating from my old IC community to a new one on a new OS.

	Already cleared cache from support area, but didn't work.



	Nothing was installed or disinstalled before this error happenedIt's again a ""template disk caching"" problem. 



	Now I disabled that feature and everything works.



	How can I clear the disc cache to rebuild it?


	And why it may occur while I have 60 gb of free space on my disc?If its happening a lot, I would actually advise disabling it. Its not suitable for all server environments, and it seems in your case it isntOn 8/25/2022 at 5:59 AM,   Marc Stridgen said: 

	
		
			Its not suitable for all server environments,
		
	



	Could you elaborate it a little?If your database is serving quicker than the disk, if files are not always being saved first time, if you are limited on disk space. There are a number of reasons that may be the case. Usually its when things arent being saved to disk properly or in a timely manner, and it leads to things like the aboveOn 8/25/2022 at 2:34 AM,   GiulioPua said:

	Where should I switch it?



	Here?



	



	 



	Is there another way to clean cache?Clear cache button in support in the top right will clear some, but possibly not what you need. You can also disable an application and enable an application



	With regard the setting it's the ""Enable template disk caching?"" setting on the ""Server Environment"" tab. If its switched on and you are having issues constantly, I would suggest leaving it offOn 8/25/2022 at 7:51 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

AUTOSAR Service software component type,"I'm really confused about the AUTOSAR Service software component type.
It is possible to create Atomic software component like application SWC using AUTOSAR Blockset tool, but what about Service software component? In the AUTOSAR software template documentation it is mentioned that Service software component is configured on the ECU configuration phase. My question is:
What kind of tools are used in ECU configuration phase?The Simulink AUTOSAR Blockset allows you to develop ApplicationSwComponents and related higher level parts of SensorActuator-, EcuHwAbstraction-SwComponents and ComplexDrivers. These are mostly above the RTE, or abstracted from the actual HW and this correlates mostly to developing on the level of the ""Virtual Function Bus"".
The SW components are then later mapped to ECUs (SwcToEcuMapping) and are finally integrated into an ECU SW, including MCAL, HwAbstraction and Service components, which are actually configured with Tools like EB Tresos Studio, ETAS ISOLAR-A/B and Vector Davinci Configurator according to SystemDescription/SystemExtract/EcuExtract and the SW-Component-Descriptions.
Therefore, in Simulink AUTOSAR Blockset, there is no need to actually develop an ServiceComponent, since they are actually part of the AUTOSAR BSW below the RTE (e.g. BswM, StbM, Dem, Dcm, Com, LdCom).",,,,,1,191,84.56,21.07,20.67,14.5,27.29,35.08,62.83,50.26,43.98,6.28,2.09,1.05,0,0.52,0,0.52,4.19,9.95,7.33,0,14.14,6.28,5.76,5.76,0.52,8.9,2.62,1.05,1.05,0,0.52,0.52,14.66,0.52,13.09,1.57,2.62,0.52,3.14,2.09,3.66,0,0.52,0,0.52,0.52,0,0.52,0,0,0,0,2.62,1.57,0,0,0,0,1.05,1.05,0,0,0,0,3.14,0,0,3.14,4.19,0,0,4.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,2.09,5.76,0,0,5.76,0,0,0,2.09,1.05,6.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.47,4.19,7.85,1.05,0,0.52,7.85,

Accounting Software Design Patterns [closed],"A while ago when I was assigned to work on such a system, I found this link in the Martin Fowler website:

Martin Fowler - Accounting Patterns

It contais some patterns for accounting software, such as accounting entries, transactions and adjustments. The architecture he describes is based on events. Never read it entirely, as the system I work on was already in the middle of its development stage and I couldn't change the design.

Hope it helps.Martin Fowler's Analysis Patterns covers some of those topics.For dealing with currencies, remember that you need to always remember not just what currency the amount was entered in, but also what time it was entered, and what the rate of each currency was at that time. Also, accountants are not forgiving when it comes to ""inaccuracies"" in amounts. If an amount is entered, you have to store it as it was entered, and not convert it first, because afterwards you won't be able to guarantee that you can get back the entered amount just like it was entered.

These may sound like obvious things, but people do sin against them in the real world.I can Recommend Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture and 
Analysis Patterns, Reusable Object Models both by Martin Fowler they give software architectural patterns to common problems.FOR UI / REPORTING: Look into Crystal Reports and Business Objects.  Both are used at my place of employment in the Investment Accounting department.

About the Addons from your image this is making reference to the firewall in the device. 

there is two types of firewalls: hardware firewall and deidcated firewall.

In order to know if your server has installed a hardware firewall you only have to review if there is any data inside the ""firewallServiceComponent"" property in case this is empty the server does not have any hardware firewall installed.

For dedicated firewall you have to review the ""frontendNetworkComponents"" property and verify if this is a dedicated firewall, for that you can use this objectMask frontendNetworkComponents[primarySubnet[networkVlan[dedicatedFirewallFlag]]] , in case the  ""dedicatedFirewallFlag"" is 1 the server belongs to a dedicated Firewall.

Aliases in Windows command prompt,"I have added notepad++.exe to my Path in Environment variables. Now in command prompt, notepad++.exe filename.txt opens the filename.txt. But I want to do just np filename.txt to open the file. I tried using DOSKEY np=notepad++. But it is just bringing to the forefront an already opened notepad++ without opening the file. How can I make it open the file? Thanks.To add to josh's answer,
you may make the alias(es) persistent with the following steps,

Create a .bat or .cmd file with your DOSKEY commands.

Run regedit and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor

Add String Value entry with the name AutoRun and the full path of your .bat/.cmd file.
For example, %USERPROFILE%\alias.cmd, replacing the initial segment of the path with %USERPROFILE% is useful for syncing among multiple machines.


This way, every time cmd is run, the aliases are loaded.
For Windows 10, add the entry to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor instead.
For completeness, here is a template to illustrate the kind of aliases one may find useful.
@echo off

:: Temporary system path at cmd startup

set PATH=%PATH%;""C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2\""

:: Add to path by command

DOSKEY add_python26=set PATH=%PATH%;""C:\Python26\""
DOSKEY add_python33=set PATH=%PATH%;""C:\Python33\""

:: Commands

DOSKEY ls=dir /B $*
DOSKEY sublime=sublime_text $*  
    ::sublime_text.exe is name of the executable. By adding a temporary entry to system path, we don't have to write the whole directory anymore.
DOSKEY gsp=""C:\Program Files (x86)\Sketchpad5\GSP505en.exe""
DOSKEY alias=notepad %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\alias.cmd

:: Common directories

DOSKEY dropbox=cd ""%USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\$*""
DOSKEY research=cd %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\Research\



Note that the $* syntax works after a directory string as well as an executable which takes in arguments. So in the above example, the user-defined command dropbox research points to the same directory as research.
As Rivenfall pointed out, it is a good idea to include a command that allows for convenient editing of the alias.cmd file. See alias above. If you are in a cmd session, enter cmd to restart cmd and reload the alias.cmd file.


When I searched the internet for an answer to the question, somehow the discussions were either focused on persistence only or on some usage of DOSKEY only. I hope someone will benefit from these two aspects being together here!

Here's a .reg file to help you install the alias.cmd. It's set now as an example to a dropbox folder as suggested above.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor]
""AutoRun""=""%USERPROFILE%\\alias.cmd""


For single-user applications, the above will do. Nevertheless, there are situations where it is necessary to check whether alias.cmd exists first in the registry key. See example below.
In a C:\Users\Public\init.cmd file hosting potentially cross-user configurations:
@ECHO OFF
REM Add other configurations as needed
IF EXIST ""%USERPROFILE%\alias.cmd"" ( CALL ""%USERPROFILE%\alias.cmd"" )

The registry key should be updated correspondly to C:\Users\Public\init.cmd or, using the .reg file:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor]
""AutoRun""=""C:\\Users\\Public\\init.cmd""You need to pass the parameters, try this:

doskey np=notepad++.exe $*



  Edit (responding to Romonov's comment) Q: Is there any way I can make the command prompt remember so I don't have to run this each time I open a new command prompt?


doskey is a textual command that is interpreted by the command processor (e.g. cmd.exe), it can't know to modify state in some other process (especially one that hasn't started yet). 

People that use doskey to setup their initial command shell environments typically use the /K option (often via a shortcut) to run a batch file which does all the common setup (like- set window's title, colors, etc).

cmd.exe /K env.cmd


env.cmd:

title ""Foo Bar""
doskey np=notepad++.exe $*
...If you're just going for some simple commands, you could follow these steps:


Create a folder called C:\Aliases
Add C:\Aliases to your path (so any files in it will be found every time)
Create a .bat file in C:\Aliases for each of the aliases you want


Maybe overkill, but unlike the (otherwise excellent) answer from @Argyll, this solves the problem of this loading every time.

For instance, I have a file called dig2.bat with the following in it:

@echo off
echo.
dig +noall +answer %1


Your np file would just have the following:

@echo off
echo.
notepad++.exe %1


Then just add the C:\Aliases folder to your PATH environment variable. If you have CMD or PowerShell already opened you will need to restart it.

FWIW, I have about 20 aliases (separate .bat files) in my C:\Aliases directory - I just create new ones as necessary. Maybe not the neatest, but it works fine.

UPDATE: Per an excellent suggestion from user @Mav, it's even better to use %* rather than %1, so you can pass multiple files to the command, e.g.:

@echo off
echo.
notepad++.exe %*


That way, you could do this:

np c:\temp\abc.txt c:\temp\def.txt c:\temp\ghi.txt


and it will open all 3 files.Given that you added notepad++.exe to your PATH variable, it's extra simple.
Create a file in your System32 folder called np.bat with the following code:

@echo off
call notepad++.exe %*


The %* passes along all arguments you give the np command to the notepad++.exe command.

EDIT:
You will need admin access to save files to the System32 folder, which was a bit wonky for me. I just created the file somewhere else and moved it to System32 manually.Also, you can create an alias.cmd in your path (for example C:\Windows) with the command

@echo %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 > %windir%\%1.cmd


Once you do that, you can do something like this:

alias nameOfYourAlias commands to run 


And after that you can type in comman line 

nameOfYourAlias 


this will execute 

commands to run 


BUT the best way for me is just adding the path of a programm.

setx PATH ""%PATH%;%ProgramFiles%\Sublime Text 3"" /M 


And now I run sublime as 

subl index.htmlConsole Aliases in Windows 10

To define a console alias, use Doskey.exe to create a macro, or use the AddConsoleAlias function.

doskey

doskey test=cd \a_very_long_path\test


To also pass parameters add $* at the end: doskey short=longname $*

AddConsoleAlias

AddConsoleAlias( TEXT(""test""), 
                 TEXT(""cd \\<a_very_long_path>\\test""),

NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
alfresco-svc   ClusterIP   10.7.249.219   <none>        80/TCP    8d


Just add the following alias.bat file to you path. It simply creates additional batch files in the same directory as itself. 

  @echo off
  echo.
  for /f ""tokens=1,* delims= "" %%a in (""%*"") do set ALL_BUT_FIRST=%%b
  echo @echo off > C:\Development\alias-script\%1.bat
  echo echo. >> C:\Development\alias-script\%1.bat
  echo %ALL_BUT_FIRST% %%* >> C:\Development\alias-script\%1.bat
  echo Created alias for %1=%ALL_BUT_FIRST%


An example of the batch file this created called kgs.bat is:

@echo off 
echo. 
kubectl get svc %*Actually, I'll go you one better and let you in on a little technique that I've used since I used to program on an Amiga.  On any new system you use, be it personal or professional, step one is to create two folders:  C:\BIN and C:\BATCH.  Then modify your path statement to put both at the start in the order C:\BATCH;C:\BIN;[rest of path].  

Having done that, if you have little out-of-the-way utilities that you need access to simply copy them to the C:\BIN folder and they're in your path.  To temporarily override these assignments, you can add a batch file with the same name as the executable to the C:\BATCH folder and the path will find it before the file in C:\BIN.  It should cover anything you might ever need to do.  

Of course, these days the canonical correct way to do this would be to create a symbolic junction to the file, but the same principle applies.  There is a little extra added bonus as well.  If you want to put something in the system that conflicts with something already in the path, putting it in the C:\BIN or C:\Batch folder will simply pre-empt the original - allowing you to override stuff either temporarily or permanently, or rename things to names you're more comfortable with - without actually altering the original.Expanding on roryhewitt answer.

An advantage to using .cmd files over DOSKEY is that these ""aliases"" are then available in other shells such as PowerShell or WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux).

The only gotcha with using these commands in bash is that it may take a bit more setup since you might need to do some path manipulation before calling your ""alias"".

eg I have vs.cmd which is my ""alias"" for editing a file in Visual Studio

@echo off
if [%1]==[] goto nofiles
start """" ""c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 
11.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"" /edit %1
goto end
:nofiles
start """" ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 
11.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"" ""[PATH TO MY NORMAL SLN]""
:end


Which fires up VS (in this case VS2012 - but adjust to taste) using my ""normal"" project with no file given but when given a file will attempt to attach to a running VS opening that file ""within that project"" rather than starting a new instance of VS.

For using this from bash I then add an extra level of indirection since ""vs Myfile"" wouldn't always work

alias vs='/usr/bin/run_visual_studio.sh'


Which adjusts the paths before calling the vs.cmd

#!/bin/bash
cmd.exe /C 'c:\Windows\System32\vs.cmd' ""`wslpath.sh -w -r $1`""


So this way I can just do

vs SomeFile.txt


In either a command prompt, Power Shell or bash and it opens in my running Visual Studio for editing (which just saves my poor brain from having to deal with VI commands or some such when I've just been editing in VS for hours).Naturally, I would not rest until I have the most convenient solution of all. Combining the very many answers and topics on the vast internet, here is what you can have.

Loads automatically with every instance of cmd
Doesn't require keyword DOSKEY for aliases

example: ls=ls --color=auto $*

Note that this is largely based on Argyll's answer and comments, definitely read it to understand the concepts.
How to make it work?

Create a mac macro file with the aliases

you can even use a bat/cmd file to also run other stuff (similar to .bashrc in linux)
Register it in Registry to run on each instance of cmd

  or run it via shortcut only if you want

Now you have three options:

a) load manually with shortcut

create a shortcut to cmd.exe with the following target :

%comspec% /k ""(doskey /macrofile=%userprofile%\cmd\aliases.mac)""  


b) register just the aliases.mac macrofile

c) register a regular cmd/bat file to also run arbitrary commands

see example cmdrc.cmd file at the bottom


note: Below, Autorun_ is just a placeholder key which will not do anything. Pick one and rename the other.
Manually edit registry at this path:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor]
  Autorun    REG_SZ    doskey /macrofile=%userprofile%\cmd\aliases.mac
  Autorun_    REG_SZ    %USERPROFILE%\cmd\cmdrc.cmd

Or import reg file:
%userprofile%/cmd/cmd-aliases.reg
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor]
""Autorun""=""doskey /macrofile=%userprofile%\\cmd\\aliases.mac""
""Autorun_""=""%USERPROFILE%\\cmd\\cmdrc.cmd""

%userprofile%/cmd/cmdrc.cmd  you don't need this file if you decided for b) above
:: This file is registered via registry to auto load with each instance of cmd.
:: https://stackoverflow.com/a/59978163/985454

@echo off
doskey /macrofile=%userprofile%\cmd\aliases.mac

:: put other commands hereVery easy custom aliases:
Make a new folder anywhere on your system. Make a new file called whatever you want to name the alias with the .cmd extention. Write all commands in the file, such as
cd /D D:\Folder
g++ -o run whatever.cpp

Copy it's the folder's path.
Go to Settings > System > About > Advanced system settings > Enviornment Variables...
Now find the Path variable under the System variables section. Click on it once and click Edit. Now click New and paste the copied text.
Click OK, OK and OK. Restart your Powershell/cmd prompt and voila, you got your persistent alias! You can use the same folder to make other aliases too without needing to change Path variable again!This solution is not an apt one, but serves purpose in some occasions.

First create a folder and add it to your system path. Go to the executable of whatever program you want to create alias for. Right click and send to Desktop( Create Shortcut). Rename the shortcut to whatever alias name is comfortable. Now, take the shortcut and place in your folder.

From run prompt you can type the shortcut name directly and you can have the program opened for you. But from command prompt, you need to append .lnk and hit enter, the program will be opened.Since you already have notepad++.exe in your path.  Create a shortcut in that folder named np and point it to notepad++.exe.First, you could create a file named np.cmd and put it in the folder which in PATH search list.
Then, edit the np.cmd file as below:

@echo off
notepad++.exeIf you'd like to enable aliases on per-directory/per-project basis, try the following:


First, create a batch file that will look for a file named aliases in the current directory and initialize aliases from it, let’s call it make-aliases.cmd

@echo off
if not exist aliases goto:eof
echo [Loading aliases...]
for /f ""tokens=1* delims=^="" %%i in (aliases) do (
   echo   %%i ^<^=^> %%j
   doskey %%i=%%j
)
doskey aliases=doskey /macros
echo   --------------------
echo   aliases ^=^> list  all
echo   alt+F10 ^=^> clear all
echo [Done]

Then, create aliases wherever you need them using the following format:

alias1 = command1
alias2 = command2
...


for example:

b = nmake
c = nmake clean
r = nmake rebuild

Then, add the location of make-aliases.cmd to your %PATH% variable to make it system-wide or just keep it in a known place.
Make it start automatically with cmd.


I would definitely advise against using HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun for this, because some development tools would trigger the autorun script multiple times per session.
If you use ConEmu you could go another way and start the script from the startup task (Settings > Startup > Tasks), for example, I created an entry called {MSVC}:

cmd.exe /k ""vcvars64 && make-aliases"",

and then registered it in Explorer context menu via Settings > Integration> with Command: {MSVC} -cur_console:n, so that now I can right-click a folder and launch a VS developer prompt inside it with my aliases loaded automatically, if they happen to be in that folder.

Without ConEmu, you may just want to create a shortcut to cmd.exe with the corresponding command or simply run make-aliases manually every time.



Should you happen to forget your aliases, use the aliases macro, and if anything goes wrong, just reset the current session by pressing Alt+F10, which is a built-in command in cmd.As doskey does not work for PowerShell or Windows 10 terminal apps, I am sharing this solution.
Demo to create an alias in Windows 10. Alias to be expected with input parameters:
com=D:\website_development\laragon\bin\php\php-8.1.2-Win32-vs16-x64/php8 D:\website_development\laragon\bin\composer/composer.phar

Procedure:

Create a folder named ""scripts"" in the C: drive.

Inside the scripts folder, create com.bat

Open com.bat

Example for running composer command with specific PHP version:
@echo off 
set path=D:\website_development\laragon\bin\php\php-8.1.2-Win32-vs16-x64/php8 D:\website_development\laragon\bin\composer/composer.phar
set args=%*
set command=%path% %args%
%command%


Save it

Click ""Start""

Search for ""Edit Environment Variables""

Click ""Advanced""

Add your ""scripts"" directory to PATH.


Now you can run the command as its alias.
Note: If you want to add a new alias, just create a new bat file.My quick and dirty solution is to add a BAT file in any directory which is already in the PATH.
Example:
@ECHO OFF
doskey dl=aria2c --file-allocation=none $*
aria2c --file-allocation=none %**

So, the first time you run ""dl"" it will execute the bat file, but from the second time onwards it will use the alias.Using doskey is the right way to do this, but it resets when the Command Prompt window is closed. You need to add that line to something like .bashrc equivalent. So I did the following: 


Add ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++"" to system path variable 
Make a copy of notepad++.exe (in the same folder, of course) and rename it to np.exe


Works just fine!Alternatively you can use cmder which lets you add aliases just like linux:

	The issue is being caused by your 3rd party theme. When using a default unaltered theme, the images are present. You would need to speak to the author of your theme for assistance.



	@Andreas Kling Please check yours also on a default unaltered theme, as its likely the same problem@Marc Stridgen I created an Admin login for you to our community and entered the access info in ""Review/Update Access Information"".



	When looking at the themes I see an error message for the theme we use ""Template core/admin/customization/themeDescription is throwing an error. This theme may be out of date"". The guy who has created the theme is on vacation for another week and I can't reach him. I habe no experience with themes. So I have two questions:



		Can I turn off the our current theme and switch to the default theme to check if this fixes the problems. And more importantly can I then switch back to our current (buggy but a least correctly looking theme, corporate color, fonts and so on)?
	
	
		Could you perhaps take a look at our current theme? Perhaps you see right away one setting you suspect to cause the problem and create a copy off our current theme that has this one thing turned off. If you can't do this how would you recommend us to proceed?
	

	Thanks a lot for your help on this.

Mobile Apps SDLC

http://www.propelics.com/6-tips-for-getting-started-with-mobile-app-development/A common consensus appears to be ""very short"". Most apps, unless they have an exceptionally large user base, tend to last only a very short while (1-12 months). A lot of mobile developers tend to favour the ""Release updates as frequently as possible"" approach, with new iterations of apps appearing sometimes weekly.

Another approach is to develop as little as possible, wasting as little resource as possible on any single project. Apps that are developed this way tend to have one or two bugfixes, and are then left to die off in their own time.

With new iterations of Android appearing more frequently than most people update their handsets, most developers tend to focus on a broad compatibility range.

Any Real-World Experience Using Software Transactional Memory? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 7 years ago. It seems that there has been a recent rising interest in STM (software transactional memory) frameworks and language extensions.  Clojure in particular has an excellent implementation which uses MVCC (multi-version concurrency control) rather than a rolling commit log.  GHC Haskell also has an extremely elegant STM monad which also allows transaction composition.  Finally, so as to toot my own horn just a bit, I've recently implemented an STM framework for Scala which statically enforces reference restrictions. All of these are interesting experiments, but they seem to be confined to that sphere alone (experimentation).  So my question is: have any of you seen or used STM in the real world?  If so, why?  What sort of benefits did it bring?  What about performance?  (there seems to be a great deal of conflicting information on this point)  Would you use STM again or would you prefer to use some other concurrency abstraction like actors?I participated in the hobbyist development of the BitTorrent client in Haskell (named conjure). It uses STM quite heavily to coordinate different threads (1 per peer + 1 for storage management + 1 for overall management).

Benefits: less locks, readable code.

Speed was not an issue, at least not due to STM usage.

Hope this helpsWe use it pretty routinely for high concurrency apps at Galois (in Haskell). It works, its used widely in the Haskell world, and it doesn't deadlock (though of course you can have too much contention). Sometimes we rewrite things to use MVars, if we've got the design right -- as they're faster.

Just use it. It's no big deal. As far as I'm concerned, STM in Haskell is ""solved"". There's no further work to do. So we use it.The article ""Software Transactional Memory: Why is it Only a Research Toy?"" (Călin Caşcaval et al., Communications of the ACM, Nov. 2008), fails to look at the Haskell implementation, which is a really big omission.  The problem for STM, as the article points out, is that implementations must chose between either making all variable accesses transactional unless the compiler can prove them safe (which kills performance) or letting the programmer indicate which ones are to be transactional (which kills simplicity and reliability).  However the Haskell implementation uses the purity of Haskell to avoid the need to make most variable uses transactional, while the type system provides a simple model together with effective enforcement for the transactional mutation operations.  Thus a Haskell program can use STM for those variables that are truly shared between threads whilst guaranteeing that non-transactional memory use is kept safe.We, factis research GmbH, are using Haskell STM with GHC in production.  Our server receives a stream of messages about new and modified ""objects"" from a clincal ""data server"", it transforms this event stream on the fly (by generating new objects, modifying objects, aggregating things, etc) and calculates which of these new objects should be synchronized to connected iPads.  It also receives form inputs from iPads which are processed, merged with the ""main stream"" and also synchronized to the other iPads.  We're using STM for all channels and mutable data structures that need to be shared between threads.  Threads are very lightweight in Haskell so we can have lots of them without impacting performance (at the moment 5 per iPad connection). Building a large application is always a challenge and there were many lessons to be learned but we never had any problems with STM.  It always worked as you'd naively expect.  We had to do some serious performance tuning but STM was never a problem. (80% of the time we were trying to reduce short-lived allocations and overall memory usage.)

STM is one area where Haskell and the GHC runtime really shines.  It's not just an experiment and not for toy programs only.

We're building a different component of our clincal system in Scala and have been using Actors so far, but we're really missing STM.  If anybody has experience of what it's like to use one of the Scala STM implementations in production I'd love to hear from you. :-)We have implemented our entire system (in-memory database and runtime) on top of our own STM implementation in C. Prior to this, we had some log and lock based mechanism to deal with concurrency, but this was a pain to maintain. We are very happy with STM since we can treat every operation the same way. Almost all locks could be removed. We use STM now for almost anything at any size, we even have a memory manager implement on top. 

The performance is fine but to speed things up we now developed a custom operating system in collaboration with ETH Zurich. The system natively supports transactional memory.

But there are some challenges caused by STM as well. Especially with larger transactions and hotspots that cause unnecessary transaction conflicts. If for example two transactions put an item into a linked list, an unnecessary conflict will occur that could have been avoided using a lock free data structure.I'm currently using Akka in some PGAS systems research. Akka is a Scala library for developing scalable concurrent systems using Actors, STM, and built-in fault tolerance capabilities modeled after Erlang's ""Let It Fail/Crash/Crater/ROFL"" philosophy. Akka's STM implementation is supposedly built around a Scala port of Clojure's STM implementation.

Any configuration management software using RDF?,"Alternatively, is there an RDF vocabulary or OWL ontology which could be useful in such domain?SaltStack uses yaml or json data by default, with Python's Jinja (or Mako) template language as a way to generate the yaml or json with programmatic logic.

But it has the concept of renderers which is a python module with a render method that can take a source file (eg templated YAML, or perhaps RDF) and return a python dict which conforms to Salt's highstate data structure

Disclaimer: I haven't used SaltStack, have just been reading the docs while slogging away with Chef...I don't know of any existing CM tools that are using RDF or OWL ontologies, but it looks like this is an active research topic. Here are a few sample papers.  It's a rabbit hole once you start following back through the referenced papers.  It looks like most of the focus is currently at a higher level (like requirements and personal assignment) than the current crop of CM tools can handle (packages, services, and files, etc)

Anything wrong with releasing software in debug mode?,"We all know that ""Debug Mode"" should be used for development because compiler produces more debugging information and ""Release Mode"" should be used for production releases because the compiler produces optimized code. However, lets say if you are making a software that is only used internally within the organization and code performance is not a huge issue because the software need to do a lot of file I/O and database queries. I will be very tempted to just release the software in ""Debug Mode"" in this scenario because those extra debugging information makes future maintenance a bit easier. Are there still any compelling reason for releasing software in release mode in this case?Two concerns I can think of:


Debug builds often add padding to buffers. That's why sometimes you get programs that seem to work in debug but crash in release. Seem is the operative word here, as buffer overflows are just an accident waiting to happen.
Strange things happen in debug builds. I once worked on a long running application that would crash every twenty days or so. It turns out that in the C runtime a counter (used to aid debugging) was being incremented each time a malloc/free was performed. If the counter happened to overflow - kaboom! For this reason alone I would never recommend anyone deploy debug binaries - you just never know what surprises might be waiting for your customer.Possible reasons:


Debug is not normally compiled for performance
Debug application size (normally) is a lot greater than release compiles.
If anyone tries to reverse engineer your application (for whatever reason) then it becomes a lot easier.


UPDATE: 
4. As pointed out, linker performance but I would have thought would be way down the list :p  How many times do you release a product compared to doing debug compiles? 

If you are willing to forgo the above then there is no real reason why not.The mere fact that you're asking suggests there is a benefit of Debug Mode that you want to take advantage of. If these benefits outweigh your moral guilt, then I say go ahead and do it. These benefits are probably mechanical and informational and relevant to your work, while lack of guilt doesn't really help you produce better software. It might help you sleep better, but who cares?I would guess that there is a lot more installed debug code out there than we (developers) are willing to admit.

Personally I know of lots of production systems that deploy to customers with code compiled in debug mode.I don't have any personal objection to shipping the Debug build internally, provided it works (some Debug versions won't work on non-dev machines w/o also installing the corresponding debug libraries... ran into that when I programmed C++/MFC code).

A slightly more sophisticated approach is to utilize a symbol server, one that is updated with symbols automatically by your build process.

If you were debugging an issue from a client's machine, point the light-weight debugger to your symbol server (make sure the versions match), and then start debugging.Use the release mode, but compile with all debugging information enabled and deploy the pdb files with the executables. You can debug the release binaries the same way as the debug ones - there is no difference, you just have to generate the pdb files when building.

Releasing and running the the debug build may be dangerous because it hides erros in your code that will come in release mode only.I have a vague recollection that if you take binaries compiled under Debug to a computer that doesn't have the debug C runtime libraries installed (which usually means it doesn't have an IDE, so most users fall into this category), it will barf with an error message.  I don't know if that's specific to Windows and/or C++.  I may also be misremembering... but you should certainly check to see if this happens, as if I'm right it would be a major reason to compile in release mode.extra debugging information makes future maintenance a bit easier.


It depends on what you mean by ""extra debugging information.""  

If you mean debug messages, you probably should be using Trace, not Debug, and use trace switches and trace listeners defined in the configuration file to control logging behavior at runtime.

If you mean knowing the member name and line number when there's an exception, you don't need to distribute debug builds to get that information; just distribute the .pdb files with your executable.  The Exception class uses information from the .pdb file irrespective of whether or not you've set any compilation constants.Depends on the user

If the user is technical, supplying an extra debug package for symbols may help them debug on your behalf or submit more technical bug information ... saving you money/time.

If the user is a home user ... they likely won't care if the debug information is there or not. Providing you strip out all your trace-cruft :)

If it is a business looking for a lean-mean no bloat machine, then give them a stripped version.

Depends on where your business/communication goals and constraints are.You were platform independent in the question, but this advice on why not to put debug mode in production on ASP.Net demonstrates some of the (admittedly performance related) reasons not to do this.

1) The compilation of ASP.NET pages takes longer (since some batch optimizations are disabled)

2) Code can execute slower (since some additional debug paths are enabled)

3) Much more memory is used within the application at runtime

4) Scripts and images downloaded from the WebResources.axd handler are not cached

The last point is a bit of a perf killer for certain types of controls that are 'expected' functionality in a web2.0 world, even for internal apps. See ScottGu's article for further details on the costs of the last point.

Perhaps the best way to sum up the counter-argument is ""it depends how you define code performance"".Compiling any application in Debug mode adds code to the application that is used (almost) exclusively by the compiler or IDE to debug, step through your code, etc. These debugging functions have virtually no use in real life. If you want to release an application to the public, your best bet is to compile it in Release mode. Furthermore, Release-built applications are...


Much faster and stable
Optimized for the machine
Smaller in size
More secure (harder to decompile / hack)
More efficient and easier on the hardware


If you have the option of a Release mode, why not use it? You'll always have the debug version for development, or if something goes wrong, and you can always package the Debug-built application and/or source code with your Release-built version.

Furthermore, you may also have the option of building the application for certain platforms. Compiling using Release mode will streamline the application for said platform, making it much more stable.

Even if speed is not an issue, there is no reason not to use Release mode when you compile.I have mainly two problems with the debug release:


Debug information might be a big and unnecessary insurance check for future maintenance that can be avoided by other means.
Diagnostics is an aspect of your application that should have no relation to or dependency on the build configuration that you're building


I think it is important to design and keep instrumentation and diagnostics logic in your application as an aspect or cross-cutting concern. If you're relying too much on the information provided by the debug version of your code:


Can you guarantee that it will be the debug version that will be released each time a new version of your application is released? poor documentation, someone else doing it, etc.
Applications have a tendency to grow in functionality and complexity. While performance and size of your application due to debug version may not be an issue at the moment. Things may add up and lead to potential problems. In case of performance issues, you may not even attribute them to the debug release.


You can still collect valuable information in release version. Stack trace should still be available in case of exceptions. You may not see the source file and line numbers may be but you can still see which methods get called. You should however still produce and keep around debug symbols for your release build. These symbols will allow you to debug your release version (you can even set up a symbol server). Due to code optimization, debugging information will most likely not match 100% of the code e.g. debugging information referring to a statement that's optimized away, etc. but you should still be able to debug most of it ok. For other information, such as user input data, intermediate data, executed database code etc debug release won't help you anyways as it does not capture that information. You need to keep of track of those on your own.

If you're using .NET, you can take a look at Tracing and Instrumentation . You can also consider using an existing framework such as Microsoft Enterprise Library or log4net. If it is a .NET application, you can also request JIT-compiler to generate tracking information for the release version of your application as an option. Check out this MSDN article.Other than the already mentioned performance, size, and decompiling...

Security: Debug builds and debugging information (e.g. pdb files) contain lots of information about the source code which not only makes decompiling much easier, but can also let users know internal details such as as filenames and network paths. Many companies may consider this information to be very sensitive.If it is a web site or service and performance is not an issue, then by all means release it in debug mode. If it's a desktop application then consider if the debug mode version is user friendly in how it handles errors. If it is then I would release the debug version as well.I think it's important to follow good standards, practices, and procedures. Just because the application is only used internally is not a good reason to let yourself be lazy. Although I have strong feelings about the ""right way"" of doing things, I believe the habits of writing good software outweigh the benefits, in the long run, of cheating by using a debug release. Add some exception handling, learn the pitfalls of the systems you're coding against - it'll make all the code you write better.My decision tree goes like this:

Is the program written in Java?

Yes - Then release in debug mode is fine. The JIT will take care of optimizations

Otherwise - Is the program CPU Intensive?

No - Release in debug mode is fine. 

Yes - Then compile only the hot spot in release mode. 

The underlying rationale: It is much easier to maintain code when the bug reports are generated from the exact program as the one you are running in your IDE. In the IDE you use a debug version so you should strive to release in debug mode.Are you releasing the software? (This is a ""Yes"", ""No"" question, ""Yes, but..."" doesn't count)

If so, why not do it properly and make it a real release so that you don't have to rely on debug symbols being avaible for your users....Here's what I typically do with software that needs to have debug information present (usually development type tools) - I compile my code optimized, but with symbol information, and link such that I keep symbol information.  That way, when the software crashes, I can at least get a halfway-decent stacktrace and an idea of where to start putting extra logging information for when I ship the customer a full-debug build. 

Sometimes the optimizer causes bugs, sometimes it obscures them, but at least you have the ability to narrow down your problem.  This has worked wonders for me in blackbox environments such as Raytheon where getting a core dump was impossible, and the stack trace came faxed with big black marker all over it.release two versions, one labeled if bugs appear use this one ..

But depending upon the sensitive data lock the debug version away.I personally believe in a median solution between debug and release, that is, you log enough so you can reproduce the error if it happens. When your app is stable enough, turn off your extra spicy logging with a parameter in your config file. I realise it cannot be done all the time, though. Most often when you have your app running in at one place only.

Artificially create a connection timeout error,"I've had a bug in our software that occurs when I receive a connection timeout. These errors are very rare (usually when my connection gets dropped by our internal network). How can I generate this kind of effect artificially so I can test our software? If it matters the app is written in C++/MFC using CAsyncSocket classes. Edit: I've tried using a non-existent host, and I get the socket error: WSAEINVAL (10022) Invalid argument My next attempt was to use Alexander's suggestion of connecting to a different port, e.g. 81 (on my own server though). That worked great. Exactly the same as a dropped connection (60 second wait, then error). Thank you!Connect to a non-routable IP address, such as 10.255.255.1.Connect to an existing host but to a port that is blocked by the firewall that simply drops TCP SYN packets. For example, www.google.com:81.Plenty of good answers but the cleanest solution seems to be this service
https://httpstat.us/504?sleep=60000
You can configure the timeout duration (up to 230 seconds) and eventual return code.If you are on a unix machine, you can start a port listening using netcat:

nc -l 8099


Then, modify you service to call whatever it usually does to that port e.g. http://localhost:8099/some/sort/of/endpoint

Then, your service will open the connection and write data, but will never get a response, and so will give you a Read Time Out (rather than Connection Refused)The following URL always gives a timeout, and combines the best of @Alexander and @Emu's answers above:

http://example.com:81

Using example.com:81 is an improvement on Alexander's answer because example.com is reserved by the DNS standard, so it will always be unreachable, unlike google.com:81, which may change if Google feels like it. Also, because example.com is defined to be unreachable, you won't be flooding Google's servers.

I'd say it's an improvement over @emu's answer because it's a lot easier to remember.10.0.0.0
10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0
172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0
192.168.255.255


All these are non-routable.You can use the Python REPL to simulate a timeout while receiving data (i.e. after a connection has been established successfully). Nothing but a standard Python installation is needed.

Python 2.7.4 (default, Apr  6 2013, 19:54:46) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.
>>> import socket
>>> s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)        
>>> s.bind(('localhost', 9000))
>>> s.listen(0)
>>> (clientsocket, address) = s.accept()


Now it waits for an incoming connection. Connect whatever you want to test to localhost:9000. When you do, Python will accept the connection and accept() will return it. Unless you send any data through the clientsocket, the caller's socket should time out during the next recv().I would like to point everybody's attention to mitmproxy.
With a config (taken from their examples) of 200:b@100:dr you'll get a connection that randomly drops.How about a software solution:

Install SSH server on the application server. Then, use socket tunnel to create a link between your local port and the remote port on the application server. You can use ssh client tools to do so. Have your client application connect to your mapped local port instead. Then, you can break the socket tunnel at will to simulate the connection timeout.If you want to use an active connection you can also use http://httpbin.org/delay/#, where # is the time you want their server to wait before sending a response. As long as your timeout is shorter than the delay ... should simulate the effect. I've successfully used it with the python requests package.

You may want to modify your request if you're sending anything sensitive - no idea what happens to the data sent to them.There are services available which allow you to artificially create origin timeouts by calling an API where you specify how long the server will take to respond. Server Timeout on macgyver is an example of such a service.

For example if you wanted to test a request that takes 15 seconds to respond you would simply make a post request to the macgyver API.

JSON Payload:

{
    ""timeout_length"": 15000
}


API Response (After 15 seconds):

{
    ""response"": ""ok""
}


Server Timeout program on macgyver

https://askmacgyver.com/explore/program/server-timeout/3U4s6g6uDespite it isn't completely clear which one the OP wants to test: there's a difference between attempting a connection to a non-existent host/port and a timeout of an already established connection. I would go with Rob and wait until the connection is working and then pull the cable. Or - for convenience - have a virtual machine working as the test server (with bridged networking) and just deactivating the virtual network interface once the connection is established.The technique I use frequently to simulate a random connection timeout is to use ssh local port forwarding. 

ssh -L 12345:realserver.com:80 localhost


This will forward traffic on localhost:12345 to realserver.com:80
You can loop this around in your own local machine as well, if you want:

ssh -L 12345:localhost:8080 localhost


So you can point your application at your localhost and custom port, and the traffic will get routed to the target host:port. Then you can exit out of this shell (you may also need to ctrl+c the shell after you exit) and it will kill the forwarding which causes your app to see a connection loss.There are a couple of tactics I've used in the past to simulate networking issues;


Pull out the network cable
Switch off the switch (ideally with the switch that the computer is plugged into still being powered so the machine maintains it's ""network connection"") between your machine and the ""target"" machine
Run firewall software on the target machine that silently drops received data


One of these ideas might give you some means of artifically generating the scenario you needDepending on what firewall software you have installed/available, you should be able to block the outgoing port and depending on how your firewall is setup it should just drop the connection request packet. No connection request, no connection, timeout ensues. This would probably work better if it was implemented at a router level (they tend to drop packets instead of sending resets, or whatever the equivalent is for the situation) but there's bound to be a software package that'd do the trick too.The easiest thing would be to drop your connection using CurrPorts.

However, in order to unit test your exception handling code, perhaps you should consider abstracting your network connection code, and write a stub, mock or decorator which throws exceptions on demand. You will then be able to test the application error-handling logic without having to actually use the network.I had issues along the same lines you do.  In order to test the software behavior, I just unplugged the network cable at the appropriate time.  I had to set a break-point right before I wanted to unplug the cable.  

If I were doing it again, I'd put a switch (a normally closed momentary push button one) in a network cable.  

If the physical disconnect causes a different behavior, you could connect your computer to a cheap hub and put the switch I mentioned above between your hub and the main network.

-- EDIT --
In many cases you'll need the network connection working until you get to a certain point in your program, THEN you'll want to disconnect using one of the many suggestions offered.For me easiest way was adding static route on office router based on destination network. Just route traffic to some unresponsive host (e.g. your computer) and you will get request timeout.

Best thing for me was that static route can be managed over web interface and enabled/disabled easily.You can try to connect to one of well-known Web sites on a port that may not be available from outside - 200 for example. Most of firewalls work in DROP mode and it will simulate a timeout for you.Plug in your network cable into a switch which has no other connection/cables. That should work imho.You might install Microsoft Loopback driver that will create a separate interface for you. Then you can connect on it to some service of yours (your own host). Then in Network Connections you can disable/enable such interface...",,,,,1,1423,68.91,72.41,35.63,31.87,29.65,23.96,80.18,59.38,48.42,11.03,7.17,1.76,0.28,4.85,0,0.28,3.87,13.84,8.36,4.15,11.88,8.29,4.22,6.11,0.63,15.25,3.72,1.9,3.3,0.35,1.62,1.34,13.77,0.63,13.14,1.55,3.09,3.16,2.39,0.42,3.23,0.07,2.32,1.55,0.7,0.7,0.21,0.49,0,0.07,0.07,0.07,11.38,2.81,0.28,0.63,0.21,0,1.41,6.18,0,0,0,0.42,2.81,0,0,2.81,3.3,0,0,3.09,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07,0.49,0.63,1.12,0,0.07,0,0.14,0.07,0.42,3.3,8.29,0.14,1.26,6.82,0.07,0.21,0.14,4.64,2.39,4.08,1.9,0.7,0.63,0.07,0,0,25.58,8.29,2.95,0.14,0.07,1.9,12.23,

Automatic software testing [closed],"btw I just read a book from Ron Patton - Software testing and it basicly tells you what basic problematics of software testing are about. + I read some stuff about c# language too and I can say I know some basic stuff about it.Well for Automation testing you go with Selenium Web-driver .

Selenium is open source functional testing for Web application recently It is mostly used for web automation


Start with basics Selenium IDE it is Mozilla Firefox Add ons

https://code.google.com/p/selenium/

http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/

http://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.htmlThe xUnit framework is very popular for unit testing and can be utilized in many languages. The junit framework, or Java xUnit implementation is especially widely used. Personally, I think it's a good place to get started with unit testing. I'm partial to Vogella's tutorials for Java in general, and I think his jUnit introduction is pretty good: http://www.vogella.com/articles/JUnit/article.htmlWell, from your description, I think you might not be talking about unit testing, but automatic functional testing. And as you've mentioned selenium and testcomplete, I guess you are going to do automatic web testing for web sites?
If my guess is right, here are my opinions:

1) first of all, know your to-be-tested product well.Not only from technology perspective, but also from business perspective. 

2) To learn some fundamental concepts and testing methods will help you to test (you should know how to test before you think about how to automatically test it, right?).There are many good books in this topic.

3) Facing automatic web testing, to know something about html, css, javascript is important. Also know something about your back-end language will help (for example, if your backend system is written by php, then you'd better get some basic ideas about how it works with web pages)

4) For automatic web testing tools, I can only say that selenium is a good tool for our product. But it is up to you to determine whether it fits your product. Just like what @Chris Kenst said in the comment. There is no silver bullet in web testing...

Hope this help.Selenium WebDriver is the most popular automated test framework being used in software development nowadays. Since it supports all the main programming languages such as C#, Perl, Ruby, PHP and JAVA, you have the freedom to learn and create test code in any of these languages. Selenium WebDriver+JAVA is the combination which is used the most. Of course, knowledge of html, javascript and css is important. Keep in mind that a tester's job is hands-on. There will be many good books on test automation. However, the best training and skill set comes from working on actual projects.I think it would be better to go with selenium web driver with Test NG automation testing framework, because 
Using TestNG you can generate a proper report, and you can easily come to know how many test cases are passed, failed and skipped.
You can execute failed test case separately. For example.
Suppose, you have five test cases, one method is written for each test case (Assume that the program is written using the main method without using testNG). When you run this program first, three methods are executed successfully, and the fourth method is failed. Then correct the errors present in the fourth method, now you want to run only the fourth method because the first three methods are anyway executed successfully. This is not possible without using TestNG.
The TestNG provides an option, i.e., testing-failed.xml file in the test-output folder. If you want to run only failed test cases means you run this XML file. It will execute only failed test cases.",,,,,1,650,51.23,55.66,20.29,56.22,21.67,23.08,82.31,61.38,45.85,10.31,6,2,0.15,3.69,0.15,0,4.31,10.31,3.54,2.31,11.08,8.15,6.46,5.23,0.62,19.23,6.46,3.54,3.38,0.62,2.15,0.62,14.77,0.46,14.31,4.31,2.77,1.69,2.62,0.31,2.62,0,4.15,3.23,0.92,1.85,0.92,0.92,0,0,0,0,7.69,3.38,0.46,0,0,0,1.69,4,0,0,0,0.15,4.92,0,0,4.92,9.23,0,0,9.23,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.46,0.31,0,0,0,0.31,0,0.15,5.23,4.31,0,1.38,3.54,0,0,0,1.54,1.69,6.77,1.23,1.08,1.08,0,0,0,21.85,8.15,5.23,0.31,0,0.92,7.23,
Autosar -- for software developer,"Can you suggest on this points related to Autosar, taking into consideration I am a software developer who can write some software in C? Now I Develop a functionality in C, that has to read some ECU specific data, process it & update some ECU specific data (which can be some variable or i/o signal). Now how I will be using Autosar RTE & virtual functional bus?
What will be there use to a software developer? Also, as Autosar says ""standardization of interfaces"" what does it mean? Does it mean that if some else anywhere around the world is also developing same functionality (in C language, like me) we both will be using same name of the API's for those I/O signals? How RTE will be helpful for me in Unit testing? Or what really RTE is doing from software developer point of view? I read a lot technical terms... but being a software developer these points are important for me to know. Can you explain it a bit to me. Your reply will be appreciated.I don't think it is going to be that easy...
I believe that you are developing Autosar SWC (software component).
I would recommend for you to develop a portable C module. That has very clear inputs, outputs and req. on execution (check Autosar runnables).
Remember Autosar ECU includes RTOS, therefore your module will be part of a OS task.
When and if you come to the point of building an Autosar ECU, you will be able to wrap the module and connect ins/outs with Autosar virtual functional bus signals. For that you will need Autosar framework and probably configuration tools. These are complex and expensive.
Unit test the module the usual way you test C module.
Good luck.

P.S. RTE is just the ""glue"" code generated automatically by configuration tools according the configuration of ECU BSW and System Extract for that ECU. You will worry about it during wrapping.The Idea behind dividing the functionality in AUTOSAR SWC and Basic software is to make the application SW development independent of any platform. To answer your questions.

RTE is giving the application a signal based interface, hence you expect the other SW components (inter-ECU /intra-ECU) to provide the required data in the form of signals, you dont care about the platform or type of communication medium
Yes by standardizing the interfaces (all kind of interactions), a software component or any Basic software module can be Fixed into the SW architecture. Read more about the different type of AUTOSAR interfaces.
Refer to answer 1RTE is there as a layer to 'abstract' the inner components of the system. For example, if you need to get access to the system's installed flash memory, you have to use the RTE-related memory functions.
You are correct. You only need to read the specifications and use the corresponding functions to get your desired result in an AUTOSAR system.
RTE makes sure that the developers of the software components and the middle-layer systems would work properly with minimal interaction between them. SWC developers just need to read the AUTOSAR standard and follow it to ensure compatibility with the middle-layer systems, since it is expected that the middle-layer system developers would follow that same standard in providing functionalities on their side. It also helps developers with the portability of their software.


I think all your questions can be answered by reading the AUTOSAR standard documents at the AUTOSAR website. Most of my limited knowledge in development of AUTOSAR systems (started reading about it for close to a month already), I got there.I am a Software developer who Developed a Console Application Tool for Autosar RTE, Test Case Generation for RTE, and wrote Unit Testing Scripts for the tool I created.
I Developed these using C# and NUnit Framework. Same can be Developed using C or a java or any other language. Ultimate goal is to generate AUTOSAR modules (.c and .h files) based on the requirement.
1. Software Developer Scope
As a Software Developer, i had a task to implement complete RTE and Test Applications for the Implemented RTE code.
Inputs and Outputs:
Basically our inputs were Software Component files and ECU Extract which were in ARXML format and Outputs were Rte and test application source and header files (.c and .h) which were created based on the requirements.
Tasks as a developer:
Here, as a developer, we need to perform Input parsing from AXXML to our own data structure, Schema Validation, Modal Validation, File generation etc.
2. Standardization
Yes, AUTOSAR Architecture provides standardized interface. Irrespective of the implementation strategy, API structure remains same which eases the usage. This acts as a generalised library where you can use already developed Module or you can implement the module in your own way by considering API specification. All you need is to follow the specifications provided for every module you use.
Requirement varies from Company to Company but the way of using APIs remains same.
3. Unit Testing
Unit Testing has nothing to do with RTE or AUTOSAR modules. You will be testing the Uints of Your Code. When i say your code, it is the one which you used to develop any particular module (eg. Rte.c) and not testing the generated module itself. You will be testing the Source code you developed to generate the specfic module. Your source code is not part of RTE or any other module implementation but is tool which generates the module implementation.
Overview:
Software developer have various scope in generating AUTOSAR modules depends on the Requirement.
You can develop a tool which will generate AUTOSAR modules.
You can develop an Editor which will is used to edit/create AUTOSAR XML files. (Eg: Artop)
Developing might sound complex as we do not get direct resources other than specifications. Once you are in, you will learn a lot.To answer your question
If you will go through the Layered Architecture of AUTOSAR, you will come to know this architecture is followed to minimize the dependency of the each module
(layer) with lower layer.

Again, RTE is a like wrapper to separate the lower layered dependency, this enables to work on each layer independently. Most of the virtual buses are mapped with RTE, in my experience I have worked on IOC which is allowed to map with RTE and which communicates with other SWC's with memory and core boudary. To OS Developer its via to the application layer and Mapped software partitions.

The standard is used to maintain uniformation in all software layers, however to meet the requirements the developers may have different way of implementation and design, but the API's and requirements will be universal.

This is useful for standardised intefacing too.

For Unit testing of the developers OS design and implementation RTE works as abstract module.

Autosar Software Component,"I have reading several AUTOSAR Documents. For now, my concern is just developing Software Component. I have two software component designs, take a look to the picture below. Explanation: My questions are, Thank you for your help. ====================Adding Code After Comment======================== Design 1 Design 2I think both solutions are possible. The main difference is that in the first solution the generated Rte will manage the global buffer whereas in the second design, you have to take care of the buffers yourself.
Especially if you have multiple runnables accessing the same buffer, the 'Rte' will either generate interrupt locks to protected data consistency or it will optimize out the locks if the task context in that the ´RunnableEntities´ are running cannot interrupt each other.

Even if you have only one ´RunnableEntity´ as shown in the second design, it might happen that the ´TimingEvent´ activates the ´RunnableEntity´ and the DataReceivedEvent as well (although I don't understand why you left out the DataReceivedEvent in the second design). In this case the ´RunnableEntity´ is running in two different contexts accessing the same data.

To make it short: My proposal is to use interrunnable variables and let the Rte handle the data consistency, initialization etc.
It might be a little bit more effort to create the software component description, but then you just need to use the generated IrvRead/IrvWrite functions and you are done.I'm actually prefering here the first one. 

The second one depends a bit on your SWC Description, since there is the specification of the Port Data Access. From this definition it depends, if the RTE creates a blocking or non-blocking Rte_Receive.

[SWS_Rte_01288] A non-blocking Rte_Receive API shall be generated if a VariableAccess in the dataReceivePointByArgument role references a required VariableDataPrototype with ‘event’ semantics. (SRS_Rte_00051)

[SWS_Rte_07638] The RTE Generator shall reject configurations were a VariableDataPrototype with ‘event’ semantics is referenced by a VariableAccess in the dataReceivePointByValue role. (SRS_Rte_00018)

[SWS_Rte_01290] A blocking Rte_Receive API shall be generated if a VariableAccess in the dataReceivePointByArgument role references a required VariableDataPrototype with ‘event’ semantics that is, in turn, referenced by a DataReceivedEvent and the DataReceivedEvent is referenced by a WaitPoint.
 (SRS_Rte_00051)

On the other side, I'm not sure what happens with your blocking Rte_Receive vs your TimingEvent based RunnableEntity call. 

Also consider the following:

RTE_E_LOST_DATA actually means, you lost data due to incoming data overflowing the queue (Rte_Receive only works with swImplPoliy = queued, otherwise if swImplPolicy != queued you get Rte_Read). This is not an excplicit Std_ReturnType value, but a flag added to that return value -> OverlayedError)

RTE_E_TIMEOUT would be for blocking Rte_Receive

RTE_E_NO_DATA would be for non-blocking Rte_Receive

you should then check as:

Std_ReturnType status;
status = Rte_Receive_..(<instance>, <parameters>);
if (Rte_HasOverlayedError(status)) {
    // Handle e.g. RTE_E_LOST_DATA
}
// not with Rte_Receive - if(Rte_IsInfrastructureError(status)) { }
else { /* handle application error with error code status */
    status = Rte_ApplicationError(status);

Best Practice: Software Versioning [closed],"Is there any guideline or standard best practice how to version a software you develop in your spare time for fun, but nevertheless will be used by some people? I think it's necessary to version such software so that you know about with version one is talking about (e.g. for bug fixing, support, and so on). But where do I start the versioning? 0.0.0? or 0.0? And then how to I increment the numbers? major release.minor change? and shouldn't any commit to a version control system be another version? or is this only for versions which are used in a productive manner?You should start with version 1, unless you know that the first version you ""release"" is incomplete in some way.

As to how you increment the versions, that's up to you, but use the major, minor, build numbering as a guide.

It's not necessary to have every version you commit to source control as another version - you'll soon have a very large version number indeed. You only need to increment the version number (in some way) when you release a new version to the outside world.

So If you make a major change move from version 1.0.0.0 to version 2.0.0.0 (you changed from WinForms to WPF for example). If you make a smaller change move from 1.0.0.0 to 1.1.0.0 (you added support for png files). If you make a minor change then go from 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.1.0 (you fixed some bugs).

If you really want to get detailed use the final number as the build number which would increment for every checkin/commit (but I think that's going too far).I would use x.y.z kind of versioning

x - major release

y - minor release

z - build numberI basically follow this pattern:


start from 0.1.0
when it's ready I branch the code in the source repo, tag 0.1.0 and create the 0.1.0 branch, the head/trunk becomes 0.2.0-snapshot or something similar
I add new features only to the trunk, but backport fixes to the branch and in time I release from it 0.1.1, 0.1.2, ...
I declare version 1.0.0 when the product is considered feature complete and doesn't have major shortcomings
from then on - everyone can decide when to increment the major version...I use this rule for my applications:

x.y.z

Where:


x = main version number, 1-~.
y = feature number, 0-9. Increase this number if  the change contains new features with or without bug fixes. 
z = hotfix number, 0-~. Increase this number if the change only contains bug fixes.


Example:


For new application, the version number starts with 1.0.0. 
If the new version contains only bug fixes, increase the hotfix number so the version number will be 1.0.1.
If the new version contains new features with or without bug fixes, increase the feature number and reset the hotfix number to zero so the version number will be 1.1.0. If the feature number reaches 9, increase the main version number and reset the feature and hotfix number to zero (2.0.0 etc)We use a.b.c.d where


a - major (incremented on delivery to client)
b - minor (incremented on delivery to client)
c - revision (incremented on internal releases)
d - build (incremented by cruise control)Yet another example for the A.B.C approach is the Eclipse Bundle Versioning. Eclipse bundles rather have a fourth segment:

In Eclipse, version numbers are composed of four (4) segments: 3 integers and a string respectively named major.minor.service.qualifier. Each segment captures a different intent:

the major segment indicates breakage in the API
the minor segment indicates ""externally visible"" changes
the service segment indicates bug fixes and the change of development stream
the qualifier segment indicates a particular buildThere is also the date versioning scheme, eg: YYYY.MM , YY.MM , YYYYMMDD

It is quite informative because a first look gives an impression about the release date. But i prefer the x.y.z scheme, because i always want to know a product's exact point in its life cycle (Major.minor.release)The basic answer is ""It depends"".

What is your objective in versioning? Many people use version.revision.build and only advertise version.revision to the world as that's a release version rather than a dev version. If you use the check-in 'version' then you'll quickly find that your version numbers become large.

If you are planning your project then I'd increment revision for releases with minor changes and increment version for releases with major changes, bug fixes or functionality/features. If you are offering beta or nightly build type releases then extend the versioning to include the build and increment that with every release.

Still, at the end of the day, it's up to you and it has to make sense to you.As Mahesh says:
I would use x.y.z kind of versioning

x - major release
y - minor release
z - build number

you may want to add a datetime, maybe instead of z.

You increment the minor release when you have another release.
The major release will probably stay 0 or 1, you change that when you really make major changes (often when your software is at a point where its not backwards compatible with previous releases, or you changed your entire framework)You know you can always check to see what others are doing. Open source software tend to allow access to their repositories. For example you could point your SVN browser to http://svn.doctrine-project.org and take a look at the versioning system used by a real project. 

Version numbers, tags, it's all there.We follow a.b.c approach like:

increament 'a' if there is some major changes happened in application. Like we upgrade .NET 1.1 application to .NET 3.5 

increament 'b' if there is some minor changes like any new CR or Enhancement is implemented. 

increament 'c' if there is some defects fixes in the code.I start versioning at the lowest (non hotfix) segement. I do not limit this segment to 10. Unless you are tracking builds then you just need to decide when you want to apply an increment. If you have a QA phase then that might be where you apply an increment to the lowest segment and then the next segement up when it passes QA and is released. Leave the topmost segment for Major behavior/UI changes.

If you are like me you will make it a hybrid of the methods so as to match the pace of your software's progression.

I think the most accepted pattern a.b.c. or a.b.c.d especially if you have QA/Compliance in the mix. I have had so much flack around date being a regular part of versions that I gave it up for mainstream. 

I do not track builds so I like to use the a.b.c pattern unless a hotfix is involved. When I have to apply a hotfix then I apply parameter d as a date with time. I adopted the time parameter as d because there is always the potential of several in a day when things really blow up in production. I only apply the d segment (YYYYMMDDHHNN) when I'm diverging for a production fix.

I personally wouldn't be opposed to a software scheme of va.b revc where c is YYYYMMDDHHMM or YYYYMMDD.

Binding Software,"Is there a software for Language Bindings, other than SWIG. Also which is the most efficient ? I am looking for efficiency for C++ to Python bindings.There are 6 (main) alternatives when it comes to binding C++ and Python:


SWIG - as you already know
Boost.Python - that was the advice of lefticus
Cython - very neat syntax close to Python
SIP - not very much spread, but it is there
PyBindGen - claims to be the fastest
ECS:Python - new stuff


In terms of efficiency, I guess that will depend on what the task is. If you browse a bit around the net, you will see benchmarks around. PyBindGen folks are actually very proud of their system. You may want to start having a look there.

Particularly, I have experience with Boost.Python - easy to learn the simple tasks, a bit more tricky to do the complicated stuff. Normally generates code which is not the fastest from a function call overhead perspective, but it works beautifully. This one is very mature.I cannot speak to efficiency, but the only other C++ to Python binding tool I am aware of is boost::python.",,,,,1,189,47.27,12.96,77.17,52.98,21,15.34,80.95,69.84,57.14,11.11,5.29,2.65,0,2.12,0,0.53,5.82,12.7,7.41,1.06,12.7,10.58,9.52,4.76,1.59,16.4,8.99,3.17,3.17,0,3.17,0,15.34,1.06,14.29,4.23,1.06,1.59,2.12,0.53,6.88,0,2.12,2.12,0,0.53,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,6.35,3.17,0.53,0,0,0,1.59,3.17,0.53,0,0,0,0.53,0,0,0.53,2.12,0,0,2.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.06,5.29,8.99,2.12,1.59,5.29,2.12,0,0,3.17,1.06,7.41,1.59,0,0,0,0,0,21.16,6.35,4.23,0.53,0,0,10.05,
Biologically inspired software,"I'm wondering if anyone knows of any software techniques taking advantage of biology? For example, in the robotics world, there are tons, but what about software?Many concepts originally observed in biology have been used in software. For example Genetic Algorithm (GA). 

Artificial life (AL) exposes/uses several principles of biology such as resilience to imperfect code snippets, addressing by content,  imperfect reproduction (in some implementations, also sexual, i.e. multi-orginanisms-driven, reproduction) and a non-goal-driven utility function.  An interesting result of AL, is the spontaneous production of  macro phenomenons observed in domains such as ecology or epidemiology (domains largely influenced by biology), such as the emergence of parasites and even that of organisms which take advantage of parasites, or subtle predator-prey relationships. 

Maybe software can be said to have gone ""full circle"" with some experiments in computing which involve real (carbon-based) DNA (or RNA) molecules!  The original experiment in this area (PDF link) by Prof. Alderman (of RSA fame), who coded the various elements of a graph-related problem (an hamiltonian graph) with different DNA molecules and let the massive parallel computing power of bio-chemistry do the rest and solve the problem !

Back in the digital world, but with a strong inspiration from biology and indeed from anatomy of the cerebral cortex, and from many theoretical and clinical observations in the neuroscience field, we have Neural Networks (NN).  In the area of NN, maybe worthy of a special notice, is Numenta's Hierarchical Temporal Memory model which, although it reproduces the [understanding we have of] the neo-cortex only very loosely, introduces the idea that the very same algorithm is applied in all areas and at all levels of the cognitive process powered by the brains, an idea largely supported by biological, anatomical and other forms of evidence.If your question means ""have biological ideas been used to optimize software?"" then
Genetic programming (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming) is one example. From the Wikipedia article:

In artificial intelligence, genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm-based methodology inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a user-defined task. It is a specialization of genetic algorithms (GA) where each individual is a computer program. Therefore it is a machine learning technique used to optimize a population of computer programs according to a fitness landscape determined by a program's ability to perform a given computational task.


If your question means ""what software techniques have been inspired by biology?"" then
see more generally http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-inspired_computing. I would expect that several other methods such as ant-swarms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization) and Neural Networks (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_software) could also be used.Artificial Neural Networks are another classic example. The software application tends to be pattern recognition and prediction of behaviour of complex systems.Ant colony optimization, a search / optimization method, and Artificial Life like Conway's Game of LifeMost of the answers yet talk about AI.  The title of your question hints towards software that hides itself in order not to be detected.

We got viruses.

We got virus-hunters...

Me myself, I even hid some bugs in my own programs ... :(Alan Kay (the object technology pioneer) spoke at length about the influence of biology in the OOP paradigm. He's got a series of ideas about how objects are like ""cells"" and that OOP scales in a similar way to the way that cells can scale to produce massive architectures...

	The quote gets misattributed to Nigel, even though it was said by Daniel! It shouldn’t work like that.



	Either the quote should be attributed correctly, or if that is not possible, the inline quote functionality should be suppressed within already quoted text.I can move this to the suggestions area for you, unless you want to add anything to that? This isnt however a bug. Its always been like that, and indeed you could edit it. The quote button is simply adding the text and formatting to the editor.

			… you could edit it.
		
	



	No, we can’t. That’s the point. The users could edit the quoted text itself, but that is not the problem here. They want to quote the text as it is.



	The problem is the false attribution of that quote which is created by the IPS code. Everything about it is wrong: The name. The time. The link. And users are actually prevented from correcting that. Not to mention that they usually don’t even notice. And then the wrong user gets a notification about having claimed something they never said.

Building Business Software using Qt [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 7 years ago. I want to build a business software such as : a traveller management software . My software have some requirements: +) Can run on PC and Mobile
+) Data on the cloud I intend to build UI by Qml . I heard about the Qt cloud service but don’t know clearly Is it feasible to build such a software using Qt Quick and Qt cloud service ? The pros and cons of building business software on cloud using Qt compare to other solutions ( .Net or ………) Could you please clarify for me ? Thank you very much!Qt is a cross platform library for Graphics and other general purposes.

Designing a backend for managing a shared database has been done millions of times and is possible with lots of different technologies.

QML is a scripting layer for making easy to iterate frontends for Qt.  Often heavy tasks need to be connected back to C++, but QML and Qt Quick are maturing quickly.  They also leverage the scenegraph usage of graphics cards really well.

I'm not sure what you think of python, but I ran across this project a while back and I think it is relevant:

Connecting to a Database

Basically you want to keep some kind of excel spreadsheet like object for any of your clients to connect to.

If you just put up a MySQL database up there, and left it open for any computer to remotely access, you are likely to get hacked.  Most people put some layer between the database and the world wide web with better security.

A simple example would be a MySQL database with a php frontend.  Php accepts requests and turns them into database queries.  The database is protected because it can only be accessed by the php code running on the server, and you can put a lot of security in front of that php code.

RESTful Services

So you could have a full blown website where you log in and see a view of the database, but maybe you just need to get a subset of information.  You can make a JSON or XML view into the database.

CRUD refers to Create, Read, Update, Delete.  These common commands are typical actions on database rows/entries.  JSON formalizes the requests and responses in a common way.

How to use a RESTful Service from a Client program

Qt can do this, and so can a lot of other languages, but Qt makes it easier to do the cross platform drawing of the table or buttons or other elements.

QNetworkAccessManager

After you have a basic knowledge of network ports, addresses, replies and requests, the simplicity of QNetworkAccessManager and its supporting classes make life very easy.  The examples may stretch you a bit as you are learning it, but it is awesome.

Other Options

There are all sorts of options out there for a complete solution.  Some of what you may ask yourself is what technology is recommended by your engineers on your project.  What is scalable?  What does my hosting service support?  Should I find a new hosting service that can support the kind of tables I am using?  Should I use NoSQL? Etc.

Looking at Qt is a great idea.  It is powerful.  It has been up to the task for all sorts of things.

Databases are very doable, and planning how you are going to do it is very helpful.

Hopefully my ramblings are helpful.  Good luck.

C# Querying Software Update History,"I am writing a C# console application which collects data about a machine and writes it to an external database. One of the bits of information it is necessary to collect is information about the software that is installed. There is a set of specific pieces of software we have that we would like to know about. Specifically which ones are installed, which versions are installed, and which patches they have had applied. I have managed to acquire the information about which software is installed, and which versions they are, by querying the registry. However, when it comes to figuring out which patches are installed I am a little stumped. I know that if I go to Control Panel -> Programs -> View installed updates I can see the patches I have installed for these software (specifically, it gives me the exact patch number - ie, Patch 21). So, I would like something similar. I found WUApiLib and thought it would be the answer to my problems, but when I query the update history all that is returned is a list of Microsoft updates to the OS, .NET, Visual Studio etc. There is no mention of the patches I applied to our software. I am not very familiar with how patching works, but I believe the patches use msp file format, so I think the information should be logged by Windows somewhere. How does Control Panel get it? Where might I be able to get it? The registry entries under HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Uninstall do not mention patches at all.So, after some digging around I found a different part of the registry which lists all the information I needed.

	The file in question, and its parent directories all have the same permissions as before, and the installation made it most of the way through before throwing the error.  Both ""Retry"" and ""Continue"" just loop back to the same error message.



	


	I don't see that anyone else in this forum has had a similar problem, so I'm posting this here to see if anyone has any ideas.Some servers return errors with 777 permissions. Try using 644. Also I see the file owner is root, is it possible the other files are actually owned by a different user/group? A chmod might work as well.

	Custom CSS is still present. Only direct editing of our core CSS (which shouldn't really be done) has been removed.As mentioned above, we would prefer that the core CSS is not edited, and instead that you use the custom/ folder(s) to add your custom CSS.


	This gives us the option in the future to serve all CSS from a single set of CSS files on a fast CDN.

	We are trying to discourage editing the core css files. Let's see if we can find another route. Can you expand on what specifically you want to achieve and maybe we can find a solution together. 😃@Jordan Miller one idea might be to restore the editor, but make any change done to CSS export to overrides within the custom.css.  I find it helpful to understand what is there now so that I can see how/why you do something.  In fact, I might use something you do as a basis for something else in one of my Pages databases for continuity.  



	Overall power users hate having tools taken away...  however there could be a way to allow power users what they're used to while still pushing the changes they make into the new system you want it to be without forcing them to just give up visibility in the first place.


	Essentially I'm suggesting restore the editor...  when a change is submitted, parse it versus the original and send those changes to custom.css.  When viewing the editor again, load the diff and show the updated version.On 7/6/2022 at 4:53 PM,   Jordan Miller said:

	95% of your base CSS is not used effectively - and every online test shows it. Especially when a site uses external ads.

	Also, there are enough ways to combine effectively used css into one css - and notice, without changing the structure of your development - just a small change in loading. Etc.

	Any such change, even a small one, involves direct css editing... And a lot of testing and analysis... But it's worth the effort... This can't be done in designer mode, only in direct editing... It's individual for each site, each site uses different resources and requires different tweaks to improve... Etc.

	With these restrictions you are now ""scoring an own goal""...



	PS. See your site



	



	All this slows down the loading of the site, especially on mobile. With direct editing CSS and ...one more thing, a solution to this delay is found...



			
				


	Edited July 6 by AdlagoI accept that the very few who make significant edits to our core CSS will find this change uncomfortable. The vast majority want to add or override existing CSS, so this change will not affect them.


	We want to get to a point where we can serve CSS from a single set of files via a CDN. We also want to overhaul and modernise our CSS for efficiency and enabling a more streamlined output from a better build process.


	These things do take time, and we have to take steps towards that goal, and drawing a line with 4.7.0 and asking that core CSS is not edited is the first step towards this.


	As a temporary measure, a template edit in core/front/global/includeCSS to remove the framework CSS and instead link to a separate directory of your own optimised CSS would enable you to carry on with your heavily optimised CSS. I can help you with this if you wanted to explore this.On 7/7/2022 at 3:08 AM,   Matt said:

	This is not going to help.

	I do something else in the direction of optimizing the CSS when loading.

	1. My custom css has another purpose - I have created new templates - first I load custom css - in this my custom css, I have created a copy of almost every css file, but in these copies content is only of used rules.

	2. My main css (framework.css etc) is loaded from another template, following a template for custom css - so the browser extracts the used rules very quickly and starts displaying the page, it turned out that all the other rules from the main css are loaded quickly, but they do not affect the delay.

	3. My real custom css I load inline css before closing head.

	In this way, I achieve up to 95 points score for mobile maximum and 80 minimum, depending on server load.

	This construction works optimally. I still have some work to do, but apparently I'll have to use designer mode, which will slow down my time a lot.@Adlago - have you looked into how those changes affect actual users rather than test scores? I know you like your tests etc, but improvements are only of use when they actually positively impact the user experience and load time by a discernable amount. This is why things like core web vitals exist now, as that's specifically measuring how a site loads for a user. 



	You're probably going down a rabbit hole with all this stuff which improves your scores but maybe makes <50ms difference to page load time, which in turn makes little to no difference when it comes to an actual person using your website. 



	It's up to you of course, but for most website developers there are way more worthwhile and impactful things to be doing with their time.

	Yes, I have done similar optimization on various large (with many users) sites. For each such site, it takes about 2 weeks of work - but after that, all Web Vitals are within normal limits. Here is an example from such a siteOn 7/7/2022 at 9:29 AM,   Adlago said:

	What do you want me to comment on this? My example is from a site where before optimization all indicators were bad.I'm just suggesting that there are better ways to achieve what you're hoping to without spending hours and hours hacking about in the css. Particularly as that's now harder to do.



	And on top of that, once a website is fast enough that its speed doesn't affect the user experience negatively, you're chasing ever diminishing returns for your time, regardless of how good your speed scores get. Particularly when you consider the myriad of other things which go into making a website worthwhile for a user that you could be spending your time on. 



			
				


	Edited July 7 by DllFor my part, I would be happy if all CSS were readable, as before, for reference even if not editable. The latest patch shows modified CSS and allows reverts of existing changes but unchanged CSS are still hidden and therefore, you can't use search.

	In my opinion, what you are writing is about a qualitatively new version - for example, 5.0 with preset new parameters.

	With small changes and bans in the existing versions of the 4.x family, you will only make things worse for your customers and probably turn many of them away....

	Your idea is good, even avant-garde, but it will work only with a qualitatively new version - not with the 4.x familyOn 7/7/2022 at 9:46 AM,   Dll said:

	Last night I went to work and built a new theme of mine based on 4.7.

	In this theme I introduced my customizations in the accessible CSS.

	Test scores - 100 points for desktop and an appalling 55-60 for mobile.

	It is clear that IPS developers work actively only for desktop, and as it can be seen from tests on this site - they do nothing at all for mobile.

	Given that they have neglected mobile, what is the point of preventing users from seeking their own solutions for mobile enhancements for their users...

	I understand that IPS have ideas for modernization, but on a well-functioning version, to off the ""fuel tank"" because you want a motor to run on electricity is tantamount to a disaster...It’s understandable that you don’t like this change as it prevents you from doing something you have gotten used to, but please keep it honest and factual.

	This was already answered. Clearly and thoroughly. So why ask it again? This is actually a dishonest debate tactic. By keep asking it, even though it was already answered, you are trying to suggest there is no good answer.

Calendar is broken,"After doing some Calendar-related maintenance (including deleting the default community Calendar, which has been there for years, and creating a new one), I find that I am no longer able to access the Calendar app at all on my site.



	When I click Calendar off my site, I get the following:


Error: Call to undefined method DateTime::getDateInformation() (0)
#0 /XXX/public_html/applications/calendar/sources/Event/Event.php(363): IPS\calendar\_Event::_findOccurances()

	I notice that there's a different spelling of ""findOccurences"" across lines #0 and #1, but everything was also working fine until I deleted my old default Calendar, so....nanAs noted by @media, this looks to be a bug in the latest versions of PHP (8.0.22 & 8.1.9).  You can use a different version of PHP for now this is a show stopper for you.

	Of course, nothing can be perfectly done. It also depends on your hosting company, normally you have some recommendations from Invisioncommunity. All the new updates are tested for sure by the invisioncommunity developers to make sure that they run perfectly without a problem.

	You can go to Support in AdminCP on the top-right-corner and check if everything is okay.

	This is not an IPS bug. It’s a bug within PHP itself. Meaning you could have had a perfectly working installation and then upgraded your version of PHP and it magically broke without you doing any update. 


	Even outside of that however ANY complex piece of software will have issues. There are literally hundreds of thousands of interdependencies and it is impossible to test them all without doing releases only every few years. Even then you’ll miss stuff. Look at major operating systems for example.

Cannot Create a Certain Username,"I've run into a bit of an issue that I'm sure is just some setting, but it's got me stumped. We've got sister forums, both running the latest version IPS and hosted on the same server. The newer/smaller forum (which I'm selecting in the dropdown box above) is set up to allow users to link their sign-in info from the there accounts on the older/larger forum. We have a user who joined the older forum in 2008 with the username ""carrabassett"". He joined the newer forum in 2018 with a username of ""Silverwings"". He'd now like his username changed to be ""carrabassett"" on both forums, but two of us in the Admin CP have worked on this and can't get it. We are not allowed to change the name or create an account with that name. I'm assuming that it's due to the 7-9th letters in the username being a word included in our word filter. So, we even removed it from the word filter but could not create it even then.

Cannot use object of type stdClass as array?,"I get a strange error using json_decode(). It decode correctly the data (I saw it using print_r), but when I try to access to info inside the array I get: I only tried to do: $result['context'] where $result has the data returned by json_decode() How can I read values inside this array?Use the second parameter of json_decode to make it return an array:

$result = json_decode($data, true);The function json_decode() returns an object by default.

You can access the data like this:

var_dump($result->context);


If you have identifiers like from-date (the hyphen would cause a PHP error when using the above method) you have to write:

var_dump($result->{'from-date'});


If you want an array you can do something like this:

$result = json_decode($json, true);


Or cast the object to an array:

$result = (array) json_decode($json);You must access it using -> since its an object.

Change your code from:

$result['context'];


To:

$result->context;Use true as the second parameter to json_decode. This will decode the json into an associative array instead of stdObject instances:

$my_array = json_decode($my_json, true);


See the documentation for more details.Have same problem today, solved like this:

If you call json_decode($somestring) you will get an Object and you need to access like $object->key , but if u call json_decode($somestring, true) you will get an dictionary and can access like $array['key']It's not an array, it's an object of type stdClass.

You can access it like this:

echo $oResult->context;


More info here: What is stdClass in PHP?As the Php Manual say,


  print_r — Prints human-readable information about a variable



When we use json_decode();, we get an object of type stdClass as return type.
The arguments, which are to be passed inside of print_r() should either be an array or a string. Hence, we cannot pass an object inside of print_r(). I found 2 ways to deal with this. 


Cast the object to array.

This can be achieved as follows.

$a = (array)$object;

By accessing the key of the Object

As mentioned earlier, when you use json_decode(); function, it returns an Object of stdClass. you can access the elements of the object with the help of -> Operator.

$value = $object->key;



One, can also use multiple keys to extract the sub elements incase if the object has nested arrays.

$value = $object->key1->key2->key3...;


Their are other options to print_r() as well, like var_dump(); and var_export();

P.S : Also, If you set the second parameter of the json_decode(); to true, it will automatically convert the object to an array(); 

Here are some references: 

http://php.net/manual/en/function.print-r.php

http://php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php

http://php.net/manual/en/function.var-export.phpTry something like this one!
Instead of getting the context like:(this works for getting array index's)
$result['context']

try (this work for getting objects)
$result->context

Other Example is: (if $result has multiple data values)
Array
(
    [0] => stdClass Object
        (
            [id] => 15
            [name] => 1 Pc Meal
            [context] => 5
            [restaurant_id] => 2
            [items] => 
            [details] => 1 Thigh (or 2 Drums) along with Taters
            [nutrition_fact] => {"""":""""}
            [servings] => menu
            [availability] => 1
            [has_discount] => {""menu"":0}
            [price] => {""menu"":""8.03""}
            [discounted_price] => {""menu"":""""}
            [thumbnail] => YPenWSkFZm2BrJT4637o.jpg
            [slug] => 1-pc-meal
            [created_at] => 1612290600
            [updated_at] => 1612463400
        )

)

Then try this:
foreach($result as $results)
{
      $results->context;
}To get an array as result from a json string you should set second param as boolean true.

$result = json_decode($json_string, true);
$context = $result['context'];


Otherwise $result will be an std object. but you can access values as object.

  $result = json_decode($json_string);
 $context = $result->context;Sometimes when working with API you simply want to keep an object an object. To access the object that has nested objects you could do the following:

We will assume when you print_r the object you might see this:

print_r($response);

stdClass object
(
    [status] => success
    [message] => Some message from the data
    [0] => stdClass object
        (
            [first] => Robert
            [last] => Saylor

        )
    [1] => stdClass object
        (
            [country] => USA
        )
)


To access the first part of the object:

print $response->{'status'};


And that would output ""success""

Now let's key the other parts:

$first = $response->{0}->{'first'};
print ""First name: {$first}<br>"";


The expected output would be ""Robert"" with a line break.

You can also re-assign part of the object to another object.

$contact = $response->{0};
print ""First Name: "" . $contact->{'first'} . ""<br>"";


The expected output would be ""Robert"" with a line break.

To access the next key ""1"" the process is the same.

print ""Country: "" . $response->{1}->{'country'} . ""<br>"";


The expected output would be ""USA""

Hopefully this will help you understand objects and why we want to keep an object an object. You should not need to convert an object to an array to access its properties.You can convert stdClass object to array like: 

$array = (array)$stdClass;


stdClsss to arrayWhen you try to access it as $result['context'], you treating it as an array, the error it's telling you that you are actually dealing with an object, then you should access it as $result->contextHere is the function signature:

mixed json_decode ( string $json [, bool $assoc = false [, int $depth = 512 [, int $options = 0 ]]] )


When param is false, which is default, it will return an appropriate php type. You fetch the value of that type using object.method paradigm.

When param is true, it will return associative arrays.

It will return NULL on error.

If you want to fetch value through array, set assoc to true.I got this error out of the blue because my facebook login suddently stopped working (I had also changed hosts) and throwed this error. The fix is really easy

The issue was in this code

  $response = (new FacebookRequest(
    FacebookSession::newAppSession($this->appId, $this->appSecret),
    'GET',
    '/oauth/access_token',
    $params
  ))->execute()->getResponse(true);

  if (isset($response['access_token'])) {       <---- this line gave error
    return new FacebookSession($response['access_token']);
  }


Basically isset() function expect an array but instead it find an object. The simple solution is to convert PHP object to array using (array) quantifier. The following is the fixed code.

  $response = (array) (new FacebookRequest(
    FacebookSession::newAppSession($this->appId, $this->appSecret),
    'GET',
    '/oauth/access_token',
    $params
  ))->execute()->getResponse(true);


Note the use off array() quantifier in first line.instead of using the brackets use the object operator for example my array based on database object is created like this in a class called DB:

class DB {
private static $_instance = null;
private $_pdo,
        $_query, 
        $_error = false,
        $_results,
        $_count = 0;



private function __construct() {
    try{
        $this->_pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=' . Config::get('mysql/host') .';dbname=' . Config::get('mysql/db') , Config::get('mysql/username') ,Config::get('mysql/password') );


    } catch(PDOException $e) {
        $this->_error = true;
        $newsMessage = 'Sorry.  Database is off line';
        $pagetitle = 'Teknikal Tim - Database Error';
        $pagedescription = 'Teknikal Tim Database Error page';
        include_once 'dbdown.html.php';
        exit;
    }
    $headerinc = 'header.html.php';
}

public static function getInstance() {
    if(!isset(self::$_instance)) {
        self::$_instance = new DB();
    }

    return self::$_instance;

}


    public function query($sql, $params = array()) {
    $this->_error = false;
    if($this->_query = $this->_pdo->prepare($sql)) {
    $x = 1;
        if(count($params)) {
        foreach($params as $param){
            $this->_query->bindValue($x, $param);
            $x++;
            }
        }
    }
    if($this->_query->execute()) {

        $this->_results = $this->_query->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
        $this->_count = $this->_query->rowCount();

    }

    else{
        $this->_error = true;
    }

    return $this;
}

public function action($action, $table, $where = array()) {
    if(count($where) ===3) {
        $operators = array('=', '>', '<', '>=', '<=');

        $field      = $where[0];
        $operator   = $where[1];
        $value      = $where[2];

        if(in_array($operator, $operators)) {
            $sql = ""{$action} FROM {$table} WHERE {$field} = ?"";

            if(!$this->query($sql, array($value))->error()) {
            return $this;
            }
        }

    }
    return false;
}

    public function get($table, $where) {
    return $this->action('SELECT *', $table, $where);

public function results() {
    return $this->_results;
}

public function first() {
    return $this->_results[0];
}

public function count() {
    return $this->_count;
}

}


to access the information I use this code on the controller script:

<?php
$pagetitle = 'Teknikal Tim - Service Call Reservation';
$pagedescription = 'Teknikal Tim Sevice Call Reservation Page';
require_once $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .'/core/init.php';
$newsMessage = 'temp message';

$servicecallsdb = DB::getInstance()->get('tt_service_calls', array('UserID',
 '=','$_SESSION['UserID']));

if(!$servicecallsdb) {
// $servicecalls[] = array('ID'=>'','ServiceCallDescription'=>'No Service Calls');
} else {
$servicecalls = $servicecallsdb->results();
}
include 'servicecalls.html.php';



?>


then to display the information I check to see if servicecalls has been set and has a count greater than 0 remember it's not an array I am referencing so I access the records with the object operator ""->"" like this:

<?php include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .'/includes/header.html.php';?>

if (isset($servicecalls)) {
if (count ($servicecalls) > 0){
     foreach ($servicecalls as $servicecall) {
        echo '<a href=""/servicecalls/?servicecall=' .$servicecall->ID .'"">'
  .$servicecall->ServiceCallDescription .'</a>';
    }
}else echo 'No service Calls';

}

Case insensitive 'Contains(string)',"Is there a way to make the following return true? There doesn't seem to be an overload that allows me to set the case sensitivity. Currently I UPPERCASE them both, but that's just silly (by which I am referring to the i18n issues that come with up- and down casing). UPDATE This question is ancient and since then I have realized I asked for a simple answer for a really vast and difficult topic if you care to investigate it fully. For most cases, in mono-lingual, English code bases this answer will suffice. I'm suspecting because most people coming here fall in this category this is the most popular answer. This answer however brings up the inherent problem that we can't compare text case insensitive until we know both texts are the same culture and we know  what that culture is. This is maybe a less popular answer, but I think it is more correct and that's why I marked it as such.You could use the String.IndexOf Method and pass StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase as the type of search to use:
string title = ""STRING"";
bool contains = title.IndexOf(""string"", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) >= 0;

Even better is defining a new extension method for string:
public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static bool Contains(this string source, string toCheck, StringComparison comp)
    {
        return source?.IndexOf(toCheck, comp) >= 0;
    }
}

Note, that null propagation ?. is available since C# 6.0 (VS 2015), for older versions use
if (source == null) return false;
return source.IndexOf(toCheck, comp) >= 0;

USAGE:
string title = ""STRING"";
bool contains = title.Contains(""string"", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);To test if the string paragraph contains the string word (thanks @QuarterMeister)
culture.CompareInfo.IndexOf(paragraph, word, CompareOptions.IgnoreCase) >= 0

Where culture is the instance of CultureInfo describing the language that the text is written in.
This solution is transparent about the definition of case-insensitivity, which is language dependent. For example, the English language uses the characters I and i for the upper and lower case versions of the ninth letter, whereas the Turkish language uses these characters for the eleventh and twelfth letters of its 29 letter-long alphabet. The Turkish upper case version of 'i' is the unfamiliar character 'İ'.
Thus the strings tin and TIN are the same word in English, but different words in Turkish. As I understand, one means 'spirit' and the other is an onomatopoeia word. (Turks, please correct me if I'm wrong, or suggest a better example)
To summarise, you can only answer the question 'are these two strings the same but in different cases' if you know what language the text is in. If you don't know, you'll have to take a punt. Given English's hegemony in software, you should probably resort to CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, because it will be wrong in familiar ways.You can use IndexOf() like this:
string title = ""STRING"";

if (title.IndexOf(""string"", 0, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) != -1)
{
    // The string exists in the original
}

Since 0 (zero) can be an index, you check against -1.
Microsoft .NET Documentation:

The zero-based index position of the value parameter from the start of the current instance if that string is found, or -1 if it is not. If value is Empty, the return value is startIndex..NET Core 2.0+ (including .NET 5.0+)
.NET Core has had a pair of methods to deal with this since version 2.0 :

String.Contains(Char, StringComparison)
String.Contains(String, StringComparison)

Example:
""Test"".Contains(""test"", System.StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase);

It is now officially part of the .NET Standard 2.1, and therefore part of all the implementations of the Base Class Library that implement this version of the standard (or a higher one).Alternative solution using Regex:

bool contains = Regex.IsMatch(""StRiNG to search"", Regex.Escape(""string""), RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);You could always just up or downcase the strings first.  

string title = ""string"":
title.ToUpper().Contains(""STRING"")  // returns true


Oops, just saw that last bit.  A case insensitive compare would *probably* do the same anyway, and if performance is not an issue, I don't see a problem with creating uppercase copies and comparing those.  I could have sworn that I once saw a case-insensitive compare once...One issue with the answer is that it will throw an exception if a string is null. You can add that as a check so it won't:

public static bool Contains(this string source, string toCheck, StringComparison comp)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(toCheck) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(source))
        return true;

    return source.IndexOf(toCheck, comp) >= 0;
}StringExtension class is the way forward, I've combined a couple of the posts above to give a complete code example:

public static class StringExtensions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Allows case insensitive checks
    /// </summary>
    public static bool Contains(this string source, string toCheck, StringComparison comp)
    {
        return source.IndexOf(toCheck, comp) >= 0;
    }
}This is clean and simple.


Regex.IsMatch(file, fileNamestr, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase)OrdinalIgnoreCase, CurrentCultureIgnoreCase or InvariantCultureIgnoreCase?

Since this is missing, here are some recommendations about when to use which one:

Dos


Use StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase for comparisons
as your safe default for culture-agnostic string matching.
Use StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase comparisons
for increased speed.
Use StringComparison.CurrentCulture-based string operations
when displaying the output to the user.
Switch current use of string operations based on the invariant
culture to use the non-linguistic StringComparison.Ordinal or      StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase when the comparison is

linguistically irrelevant (symbolic, for example). 
Use ToUpperInvariant rather than ToLowerInvariant when
normalizing strings for comparison.


Don'ts


Use overloads for string operations that don't explicitly
or implicitly specify the string comparison mechanism.
Use StringComparison.InvariantCulture -based string

operations in most cases; one of the few exceptions would be

persisting linguistically meaningful but culturally-agnostic data.




Based on these rules you should use:

string title = ""STRING"";
if (title.IndexOf(""string"", 0, StringComparison.[YourDecision]) != -1)
{
    // The string exists in the original
}


whereas [YourDecision] depends on the recommendations from above.

link of source: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973919.aspxThese are the easiest solutions.


By Index of

string title = ""STRING"";

if (title.IndexOf(""string"", 0, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase) != -1)
{
    // contains 
}

By Changing case

string title = ""STRING"";

bool contains = title.ToLower().Contains(""string"")

By Regex

Regex.IsMatch(title, ""string"", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);As simple and works 

title.ToLower().Contains(""String"".ToLower())Just like this:

string s=""AbcdEf"";
if(s.ToLower().Contains(""def""))
{
    Console.WriteLine(""yes"");
}You can use a string comparison parameter (available from .NET Core 2.1 and above)  String.Contains Method.
public bool Contains (string value, StringComparison comparisonType);

Example:
string title = ""ASTRINGTOTEST"";
title.Contains(""string"", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase);I know that this is not the C#, but in the framework (VB.NET) there is already such a function

Dim str As String = ""UPPERlower""
Dim b As Boolean = InStr(str, ""UpperLower"")


C# variant:

string myString = ""Hello World"";
bool contains = Microsoft.VisualBasic.Strings.InStr(myString, ""world"");The InStr method from the VisualBasic assembly is the best if you have a concern about internationalization (or you could reimplement it).  Looking at in it dotNeetPeek shows that not only does it account for caps and lowercase, but also for kana type and full- vs. half-width characters (mostly relevant for Asian languages, although there are full-width versions of the Roman alphabet too).  I'm skipping over some details, but check out the private method InternalInStrText:

private static int InternalInStrText(int lStartPos, string sSrc, string sFind)
{
  int num = sSrc == null ? 0 : sSrc.Length;
  if (lStartPos > num || num == 0)
    return -1;
  if (sFind == null || sFind.Length == 0)
    return lStartPos;
  else
    return Utils.GetCultureInfo().CompareInfo.IndexOf(sSrc, sFind, lStartPos, CompareOptions.IgnoreCase | CompareOptions.IgnoreKanaType | CompareOptions.IgnoreWidth);
}Use this:

string.Compare(""string"", ""STRING"", new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(""en-US""), System.Globalization.CompareOptions.IgnoreCase);This is quite similar to other example here, but I've decided to simplify enum to bool, primary because other alternatives are normally not needed. Here is my example:

public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static bool Contains(this string source, string toCheck, bool bCaseInsensitive )
    {
        return source.IndexOf(toCheck, bCaseInsensitive ? StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase : StringComparison.Ordinal) >= 0;
    }
}


And usage is something like:

if( ""main String substring"".Contains(""SUBSTRING"", true) )
....Just to build on the answer here, you can create a string extension method to make this a little more user-friendly:

    public static bool ContainsIgnoreCase(this string paragraph, string word)
    {
        return CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.CompareInfo.IndexOf(paragraph, word, CompareOptions.IgnoreCase) >= 0;
    }Using a RegEx is a straight way to do this:

Regex.IsMatch(title, ""string"", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);if you want to check if your passed string is in string then there is a simple method for that.

string yourStringForCheck= ""abc"";
string stringInWhichWeCheck= ""Test abc abc"";

bool isContained = stringInWhichWeCheck.ToLower().IndexOf(yourStringForCheck.ToLower()) > -1;


This boolean value will return if the string is contained or notSimilar to previous answers (using an extension method) but with two simple null checks (C# 6.0 and above):
public static bool ContainsIgnoreCase(this string source, string substring)
{
    return source?.IndexOf(substring ?? """", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) >= 0;
}

If source is null, return false (via null-propagation operator ?.)
If substring is null, treat as an empty string and return true (via null-coalescing operator ??)
The StringComparison can of course be sent as a parameter if needed.The top-rated several answers are all good and correct in their own ways, I write here to add more information, context, and perspective.
For clarity, let us consider that string A contains string B if there is any subsequence of codepoints in A which is equal to B. If we accept this, the problem is reduced to the question of whether two strings are equal.
The question of when strings are equal has been considered in detail for many decades. Much of the present state of knowledge is encapsulated in SQL collations. Unicode normal forms are close to a proper subset of this. But there is more beyond even SQL collations.
For example, in SQL collations, you can be

Strictly binary sensitive - so that different Unicode normalisation forms (e.g. precombined or combining accents) compare differently.
For example, é can be represented as either U+00e9 (precombined) or U+0065 U+0301 (e with combining acute accent).
Are these the same or different?

Unicode normalised - In this case the above examples would be equal to each other, but not to É or e.

accent insensitive, (for e.g. Spanish, German, Swedish etc. text). In this case U+0065 = U+0065 U+0301 = U+00e9 = é = e

case and accent insensitive, so that (for e.g. Spanish, German, Swedish etc. text). In this case U+00e9 = U+0065 U+0301 = U+00c9 = U+0045 U+0301 = U+0049 = U+0065 = E = e = É = é

Kanatype sensitive or insensitive, i.e. you can consider Japanese Hiragana and Katakana as equivalent or different. The two syllabaries contain the same number of characters, organised and pronounced in the (mostly) the same way, but written differently and used for different purposes. For example katakana are used for loan words or foreign names, but hiragana are used for children's books, pronunciation guides (e.g. rubies), and where there is no kanji for a word (or perhaps where the writer does not know the kanji, or thinks the reader may not know it).

Full-width or half-width sensitive - Japanese encodings include two representations of some characters for historical reasons - they were displayed  at different sizes.

Ligatures considered equivalent or not: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(writing)
Is æ the same as ae or not? They have different Unicode encodings, as do accented characters, but unlike accented characters they also look different.
Which brings us to...

Arabic presentation form equivalence
Arabic writing has a culture of beautiful calligraphy, where particular sequences of adjacent letters have specific representations. Many of these have been encoded in the Unicode standard. I don't fully understand the rules, but they seem to me to be analogous to ligatures.

Other scripts and systems: I have no knowledge whatsoever or Kannada, Malayalam, Sinhala, Thai, Gujarati, Tibetan, or almost all of the tens or hundreds of scripts not mentioned. I assume they have similar issues for the programmer, and given the number of issues mentioned so far and for so few scripts, they probably also have additional issues the programmer ought to consider.


That gets us out of the ""encoding"" weeds.
Now we must enter the ""meaning"" weeds.

is Beijing equal to 北京? If not, is Bĕijīng equal to 北京? If not, why not? It is the Pinyin romanisation.

Is Peking equal to 北京? If not, why not? It is the Wade-Giles romanisation.

Is Beijing equal to Peking? If not, why not?


Why are you doing this anyway?
For example, if you want to know if it is possible that two strings (A and B) refer to the same geographical location, or same person, you might want to ask:

Could these strings be either Wade-Giles or Pinyin representations of a set of sequences of Chinese characters? If so, is there any overlap between the corresponding sets?

Could one of these strings be a Cyrillic transcription of a Chinese Character?

could one of these strings be a Cyrillic transliteration of the Pinyin romanisation?

Could one of these strings be a Cyrillic transliteration of a Pinyin romanisation of a Sinification of an English name?


Clearly these are difficult questions, which don't have firm answers, and in any case, the answer may be different according to the purpose of the question.
To finish with a concrete example.

If you are delivering a letter or parcel, clearly Beijing, Peking, Bĕijīng and 北京 are all equal. For that purpose, they are all equally good. No doubt the Chinese post-offices recognise many other options, such as Pékin in French, Pequim in Portuguese, Bắc Kinh in Vietnamese, and Бээжин in Mongolian.

Words do not have fixed meanings.
Words are tools we use to navigate the world, to accomplish our tasks, and to communicate with other people.
While it looks like it would be helpful if words like equality, Beijing, or meaning had fixed meanings, the sad fact is they do not.
Yet we seem to muddle along somehow.
TL;DR: If you are dealing with questions relating to reality, in all its nebulosity (cloudiness, uncertainty, lack of clear boundaries), there are basically three possible answers to every question:

Probably
Probably not
Maybeif (""strcmpstring1"".IndexOf(Convert.ToString(""strcmpstring2""), StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase) >= 0){return true;}else{return false;}You can use string.indexof () function. This will be case insensitiveThe trick here is to look for the string, ignoring case, but to keep it exactly the same (with the same case).

    #endregion Public Methods
}Based on the existing answers and on the documentation of Contains method I would recommend the creation of the following extension which also takes care of the corner cases:
public static class VStringExtensions 
{
    public static bool Contains(this string source, string toCheck, StringComparison comp) 
    {
        if (toCheck == null) 
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(toCheck));
        }

        if (source.Equals(string.Empty)) 
        {
            return false;
        }

        if (toCheck.Equals(string.Empty)) 
        {
            return true;
        }

        return source.IndexOf(toCheck, comp) >= 0;
    }

Certification/Course for software designer/architecture [closed],"Questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, library or favorite off-site resource are off-topic for Stack Overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it. Closed 8 years ago. After being a software developer for 7+ years, I think it is time for me to take my programming to the next level. I am thinking in terms of a designer or an architect. Is there a certification/course available for designer/architect? I do agree that a certification/course will not make me a good designer/architect, but it will go on my resume. IMO it will also provide me with a platform for me to dig deeper. Please advise me a Certification or a Course for software designer/architect.Part of the question, you already answered that Certification is not the only criteria to become a better architecture or designer. You must have real architectural experience by designing some real world application.

I think, you can start by 

1- Designing a component from ground 0 this may be in your current project, a module, a small application.

2- Thinking in terms of more efficient Algorithms, design procedure, patterns

3- Be in touch with latest technology, platform etc.

4- Learning more deployment patterns.

5- Learning more about data storage and retrieval systems.

6- Start participating in forums, Q&A sites like SO

7- Start writing small technical papers.

There are more points beyond the ones mentioned above, but these points are surely a starting point for the long journey to be an architect.

Plus, work under a senior architect / architect as a Technical Lead or Junior Architect will also act as a boost.

Finally, there are certain certifications by the industry leaders like Microsoft, IBM, and others. One of the certifications which I know is 

MCA (Micorsoft Certiifed Architect)

But this certification  has some predefined criterias like (Min 10 Yrs work ex etc..)Before thinking about certificate, learn Design well, 


I think the basis of design described
by Uncle Bob Martin principles.
learn about Design Patterns .
There are some certificates like MCA,
but I think one should prefer to
participate in thoughtworks
university, or other international and
great developers workshops.The ""International Software Architecture Qualification Board"" (www.isaqb.org) provides a vendor- and technology-neutral curriculum on their website.

It explains the required knowledge and abilities of software architects.

Several levels of certification are available.For a vendor neutral and technology agnostic software architecture certification track, take a look at SEI training and certificates. 

For vendor neutral but SOA-specific software architecture certification, take a look at SOASchool.Apart from what has already been mentioned (Microsoft Certified Architect) - There's another that is offered by Sun (oracle..). It's known as ""Sun Certified Enterprise Architect"" and has now been rebranded as ""Oracle Certified Master, Java EE 5 Enterprise Architect""

But nothing comes close to designing real world solutions. These certifications help in exploring the options and patterns, and are very valuable - but the real test comes in how this knowledge is applied in real world.

Hope it helps.

Clubs block update time,"Hello,



	 



	I have the block ""Clubs"" in the home page of my website. I have found an issue (bug?) with that. These are the settings I have:



	


	 



	And this is what I see:



	 



	


	 



	Everything correct here, but 9 minutes ago I have added a reply in the club ""TEST 1"", and the club ""TEST 2"" is still listed first. Clubs are sorted by latest activity, so TEST 1 should be ranked first. This will happen (according to my previous experience) in 30-40 minutes from the latest reply. I guess in a few minutes TEST 1 would finally get to the first position and TEST 2 to the second position, but it will be more than 30 minutes after the reply to a thread in that club. I would need this to happen in real time or maximum 1 minute after the latest reply. Is there any way I can do that?



	 



	Also, a suggestion: it would be nice if the ""Sort by"" options in the Clubs bloc would be the same of the Topic Feed block:



	 



	


	 



	""Recently Updated"" here means the latest reply. ""Latest activity"" in the club means, I guess, latest reply (99% of the times), or a user who joined the club (1% of the times). Maybe something else is considered as ""activity""? Maybe a reaction? Anyway, it would be great to have the option to sort clubs just like the ""sort by: Recently Updated"" works for the Topic Feed block.



	 



	Thank you!I have made some tests and I see no consistency at all in the order the clubs are sorted. Sometimes the order changes immediately after a reply in a thread, sometimes it does not change at all, sometimes it changes after 30-40 minutes.



	 



	What it be possible to make this block similar to the Topic Feed block in the club sorting? Thanks!The widget is not cached so it shouldn't happen. Are you viewing the page as a guest perhaps? It might be the guest output caching that's blocking you from seeing the change until the cache is refreshed.On 8/21/2022 at 11:41 AM,   teraßyte said:

	No, I am logged in. It looks like there is no difference to logged and not logged users. The clubs will get in the correct position  around 30-40 minutes after the latest reply.We would need to look further into this for you, however the access details on file appear to be incorrect or missing.

	So is that the reason why the Topic Feed block update every 60 seconds and the Clubs block every 20 minutes? Actually is not even 20 minutes because sometimes I have seen updating the order after 35 minutes. And even if I run this task manually, the position does not change after I do it.It will be yes. Bear in mind you have just set it up to run as cron. If they weren't running efficiently previously with traffic, they may well have simply been running late.On 8/22/2022 at 9:50 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

How to solve this issue.Sounds like you need to create an installation for your VB6 project, to install the VB6 runtime and any non-standard components used. The runtime should be present by default on Vista, so it's probably non-standard components that are missing.  
Consult the answers to your own previous question in August, when you asked how to make an installation for a VB6 program. (Even that August question was already a duplicate.)You need to also copy the controls, and referenced files to the machine running your code. Some controls and referenced files will already be on the machine, but without experience you generally will not know which files are already installed. You can look at the checked  files in the Project|References and Projects|Components dialogs to see what is included in your project. You will need to scroll through the components dialog to find all referenced files, but in the references dialog all the references are organized at the top. Also, to confirm what file(s) a machine is missing you can look at the Events log. An error with the missing file will be logged. A drawback of this approach is that you will only get one missing file at a time as the Application quits on the first missing reference encountered. 

Also MarkJ and Konamiman are both correct in that the VB6 runtimes are required, although it is common for other VB6 programs to have already installed it. If you are not building  in-house applications you do not want to take anything granted and should build a complete install for your application.The other computers must have the VB6 runtime in order to run applications generated with VB6. Maybe is this the problem?

The VB6 runtime can be donwloaded from here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bf9a24f9-b5c5-48f4-8edd-cdf2d29a79d5&displaylang=enUse the Package and Deployment Wizard to create a setup.exe.

Complex software architecture,"I've got a few questions about the architecture of a software that I'm working on ! So basically, this software allow the user to access to some popular sites : Currently the architecture looks like this :
Use of MVC and Observer/Observable design patterns for interaction between the model (TApp_Core) and the user interface. So the software create an instance of TApp_Core and then depending on the user's choice, it creates some instances of other services (ex : App_Core.BookmarkingServices_Core.AddServices(Digg, User, Password);). Some questions ! Thanks and sorry for my bad English !Do you think that the current software design is right ?


There is probably not an objectively ""right"" design - there are only better or worse designs. :)  It looks like you're on the right track, but I would suggest you keep your GUI and views decoupled from the back-end services.  For example:

     View --- Controller --- Service


So the View only knows how to render things (ie. IM messages, web content, or whatever) and passes requests from the user to the Controller.  The Controller receives notifications from the Service, and updates the View.  The Service knows nothing of the front-end (so it could be scriptable, which is very useful) and just implements the protocol required to talk to the network service.  You would have a separate set of these three classes for each distinct back-end system, and an overall controller to manage the app at a global level.


  It seems very hard to link all View/Controller with each part of the model, is that normal that it requires so much works ?


Probably, yes - you are attempting a non-trivial application.  I assume you're using an MVC-style architecture.  It may require more work up front to properly decouple things, but it is definitely worth it.  The more complex your application, the more you will benefit from layering and decoupling.


  Is creating a new thread for each request to a service would be better ?


Given all the services are network-based, you need to keep the blocking I/O calls (such as socket reads) from blocking your main GUI thread.  So you either need to use fully async I/O with callbacks on one thread (not very common), or have a separate thread for each network session (the most common approach).  I would not recommend spawning a new thread for every separate request, but for an entire session.  You will need to be careful to avoid the usual threading issues, such as race conditions and deadlocks (this topic could fill a book).  The thread will need to post a message back to the GUI for notifications, as you cannot update your GUI from the context of another thread.


  (for example the TDigg receive a message from a button, it creates a thread which will create a TidHTTP, generate the request to the server, wait for the response, parse the response, send a message to each observer (callback) and then free the thread.


That sounds like you have your GUI coupled together with your controller and protocol handler.  I suggest you separate the front-end and back-end, and keep things decoupled.


  If I use the previous idea, won't it create too much threads and make the computer slow and less responsible ?


Threads are normally used to make the computer more responsive.  Creating threads has a certain overhead, and require a great deal of care to synchronise properly.  But if you have one thread per network session, the overhead will not slow things down as you would only have at most a handful.


  Does SQLite 3 is good enough to store all data on the client ? (data can be mails, rss feed, etc... so it can be quite a lot of data with times).


SQLite is an excellent database for this purpose.  It is used by some of the largest software houses in the world for client-side storage management.  It is very fast and efficient, and I'm sure it will be able to keep up with your application.

You seem to be undertaking a complex application.  I suggest you buy a book on concurrent programming, and read some more about threading.  It is a very complex issue, and can lead to bugs that are incredibly difficult to track down if not programmed with great care.  Good luck!I would advise going with an ORM framework to abstract away from your database. This gives you a meaningful data abstraction layer as well as meaning that you don't have to worry about your choice of database. SQLite is a nice compact database. It may be ok for testing. But it certainly isn't going to cut it in a real multi-user environment (it has file-level locking which will certainly make concurrent CRUD on any meaningful scale impossible). It also uses only a subset of SQL. Use and ORM and you can easily change later.Looking at your post it is hard to decide if your architecture is ""good"" or not. Here is what I strive for

In my experience, they will likely appreciate your openness and desire to make sure all parties interests are protected.

If they are large, they may have contracts/SLAs that you can use as a template, and if they are small they may agree to settle for some very simple terms. There are also many templates on the internet available for a small charge.

But as Robert says, you really shouldn't sign anything legally binding without some input from a qualified solicitor. Further, it can't be your run of the mill high street lawyer either. You really need somebody that deals with software/SLA's on a regular basis. Sadly in my experience these people are never cheap.

	i only use my forum for blogs so i always get that warning to use crons5 minutes is sufficient for most community tasks.It’s fine. Certain activities may take longer to complete such as mass deleting content which is done in batches via tasks. But it won’t “break” your site.  Or if you flag someone as a spammer, it would not actually remove that user and clean up their mess (if any) until the next cron run.

	i am the only one thats able to post on the website as its only for blogs so i think 5 minutes should be fine no?IPS official position is that one minute is what it’s standard is. From “real world” experience, it’s fine. You won’t get an OFFICIAL blessing that any other value is fine. You just have to do it and see.You can of course set the cron job to only run every 5 minutes, as we cannot override that, but we do specify one minute for a variety reasons. If you are the only one ever posting on your site, it probably won't matter.



	Just FYI, I've used the EasyCron service in the past when faced with the same issue of a 5-minute minimum. It only cost about $8 a year, their lowest-cost tier, but allowed 1-minute cron jobs.

Customizing the Gallery,"I have seen tutorials on how to customize the look of a forum (colors, logo, etc.) but is it possible to do the same with the Gallery? I have not yet installed the forum as I currently have a bbPress one that my members are used to, but the Gallery would be a new feature on my site. I would like to have it somewhat close to the look of the rest of the site.



	Where would that be done?Carole, not much help here on that, but I am just curious, how are you relating the IP Gallery to your bbPress forums? Link, embedded, or? Just the logistics of your members posting in an IP Gallery whilst using bbPress for forums makes my head spin 🙂 Or is the IP gallery a static gallery that only you have access too and can upload images too?On 8/21/2022 at 9:35 AM,   JohnCourt said: 

	
		
			how are you relating the IP Gallery to your bbPress forums?
		
	



	Right now, my first step won't be to relate them together. The Gallery will just be a section of my site where members could upload their projects. The forum will continue to be where they post answers and I am hoping they can ""hotlink"" to what they have in the gallery (instead of uploading a second time). For now, I am just testing the gallery on a test site. Once I can figure out if there is a way to customize it so it looks at least similar to my site, I'll see.

	I was a little confused Carole, thanks for your answer, I was just thinking it seems like a lot of money to spend for a gallery, and have all that wonderful IPS software hanging out there being unused, my personal opinion, get your community converted to IPS, you'll go through some growing pains for a very short while, but the reality is, IPS is waaaay more intuitive for members to use, upload images, post topics, etc etc, I know as an administrator you have your own reasons for not doing just that, but it sure seems like it would confuse members to be using two different software, not that it's not done, but I see headaches in the future for you if you are going to start an IPS gallery for your bbPress members to add images too, then when you do go to convert your bbPress to IPS, it's going to be weird, I cannot pinpoint or give you examples of the weirdness and headaches you may experience, it's just my gut feeling that it may be a headache.



	I do believe IPS has a wonderful conversion tool for transferring all your topics, posts, members and much more over to IPS. I came from a proprietary software named NING, they don't offer that conversion tool anymore, because it was a headache for IPS gurus, but even as hard as that conversion was, it was very successful.



	Just my opinions, which are worth about a penny anywhere! 😄

	As for the look, I might be missing something but I only installed the Gallery so far, since I already have a forum (the gallery being a new feature for my member so I am starting there) and I cannot see Customization -> Appearance -> Themes. Is that only available with the FORUM install?That is available on all instances. It should be the bottom left item in your admin CPOh, ok. I was looking for a similar icon on the left without realizing the paintbrush was the customization!

Cycles in family tree software,"I am the developer of some family tree software (written in C++ and Qt). I had no problems until one of my customers mailed me a bug report. The problem is that the customer has two children with their own daughter, and, as a result, he can't use my software because of errors.Those errors are the result of my various assertions and invariants about the family graph being processed (for example, after walking a cycle, the program states that X can't be both father and grandfather of Y). How can I resolve those errors without removing all data assertions?It seems you (and/or your company) have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a family tree is supposed to be. 

Let me clarify, I also work for a company that has (as one of its products) a family tree in its portfolio, and we have been struggling with similar problems.

The problem, in our case, and I assume your case as well, comes from the GEDCOM format that is extremely opinionated about what a family should be. However this format contains some severe misconceptions about what a family tree really looks like.

GEDCOM has many issues, such as incompatibility with same sex relations, incest, etc... Which in real life happens more often than you'd imagine (especially when going back in time to the 1700-1800).

We have modeled our family tree to what happens in the real world: Events (for example, births, weddings, engagement, unions, deaths, adoptions, etc.). We do not put any restrictions on these, except for logically impossible ones (for example, one can't be one's own parent, relations need two individuals, etc...)

The lack of validations gives us a more ""real world"", simpler and more flexible solution.

As for this specific case, I would suggest removing the assertions as they do not hold universally.

For displaying issues (that will arise) I would suggest drawing the same node as many times as needed, hinting at the duplication by lighting up all the copies on selecting one of them.Relax your assertions.

Not by changing the rules, which are mostly likely very helpful to 99.9% of your customers in catching mistakes in entering their data.

Instead, change it from an error ""can't add relationship"" to a warning with an ""add anyway"".Here's the problem with family trees: they are not trees. They are directed acyclic graphs or DAGs. If I understand the principles of the biology of human reproduction correctly, there will not be any cycles.

As far as I know, even the Christians accept marriages (and thus children) between cousins, which will turn the family tree into a family DAG.

The moral of the story is: choose the right data structures.I guess that you have some value that uniquely identifies a person on which you can base your checks.

This is a tricky one. Assuming you want to keep the structure a tree, I suggest this:

Assume this: A has kids with his own daughter.

A adds himself to the program as A and as B. Once in the role of father, let's call it boyfriend.

Add a is_same_for_out() function which tells the output generating part of your program that all links going to B internally should be going to A on presentation of data.

This will make some extra work for the user, but I guess IT would be relatively easy to implement and maintain.

Building from that, you could work on code synching A and B to avoid inconsistencies.

This solution is surely not perfect, but is a first approach.You should focus on what really makes value for your software. Is the time spent on making it work for ONE consumer worth the price of the license ? Likely not.

I advise you to apologize to this customer, tell him that his situation is out of scope for your software and issue him a refund.You should have set up the Atreides family (either modern, Dune, or ancient, Oedipus Rex) as a testing case. You don't find bugs by using sanitized data as a test case.This is one of the reasons why languages like ""Go"" do not have assertions. They are used to handle cases that you probably didn't think about, all too often. You should only assert the impossible, not simply the unlikely. Doing the latter is what gives assertions a bad reputation. Every time you type assert(, walk away for ten minutes and really think about it.

In your particularly disturbing case, it is both conceivable and appalling that such an assertion would be bogus under rare but possible circumstances. Hence, handle it in your app, if only to say ""This software was not designed to handle the scenario that you presented"".

Asserting that your great, great, great grandfather being your father as impossible is a reasonable thing to do.

If I was working for a testing company that was hired to test your software, of course I would have presented that scenario. Why? Every juvenile yet intelligent 'user' is going to do the exact same thing and relish in the resulting 'bug report'.I hate commenting on such a screwed up situation, but the easiest way to not rejigger all of your invariants is to create a phantom vertex in your graph that acts as a proxy back to the incestuous dad.So, I've done some work on family tree software. I think the problem you're trying to solve is that you need to be able to walk the tree without getting in infinite loops - in other words, the tree needs to be acyclical.

However, it looks like you're asserting that there is only one path between a person and one of their ancestors. That will guarantee that there are no cycles, but is too strict.  Biologically speaking, descendancy is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The case you have is certainly a degenerate case, but that type of thing happens all the time on larger trees.  

For example, if you look at the 2^n ancestors you have at generation n, if there was no overlap, then you'd have more ancestors in 1000 AD than there were people alive. So, there's got to be overlap.

However, you also do tend to get cycles that are invalid, just bad data. If you're traversing the tree, then cycles must be dealt with. You can do this in each individual algorithm, or on load. I did it on load.

Finding true cycles in a tree can be done in a few ways. The wrong way is to mark every ancestor from a given individual, and when traversing, if the person you're going to step to next is already marked, then cut the link. This will sever potentially accurate relationships. The correct way to do it is to start from each individual, and mark each ancestor with the path to that individual. If the new path contains the current path as a subpath, then it's a cycle, and should be broken. You can store paths as vector<bool> (MFMF, MFFFMF, etc.) which makes the comparison and storage very fast.

There are a few other ways to detect cycles, such as sending out two iterators and seeing if they ever collide with the subset test, but I ended up using the local storage method.

Also note that you don't need to actually sever the link, you can just change it from a normal link to a 'weak' link, which isn't followed by some of your algorithms.  You will also want to take care when choosing which link to mark as weak; sometimes you can figure out where the cycle should be broken by looking at birthdate information, but often you can't figure out anything because so much data is missing.Potential legal implications aside, it certainly seems that you need to treat a 'node' on a family tree as a predecessor-person rather than assuming that the node can be the-one-and-only person.

Have the tree node include a person as well as the successors - and then you can have another node deeper down the tree that includes the same person with different successors.A few answers have shown ways to keep the assertions/invariants, but this seems like a misuse of assertions/invariant. Assertions are to make sure something that should be true is true, and invariants are to make sure something that shouldn't change doesn't change.

What you're asserting here is that incestuous relationships don't exist. Clearly they do exist, so your assertion is invalid. You can work around this assertion, but the real bug is in the assertion itself. The assertion should be removed.Your family tree should use directed relations. This way you won't have a cycle.Genealogical data is cyclic and does not fit into an acyclic graph, so if you have assertions against cycles you should remove them.

The way to handle this in a view without creating a custom view is to treat the cyclic parent as a ""ghost"" parent. In other words, when a person is both a father and a grandfather to the same person, then the grandfather node is shown normally, but the father node is rendered as a ""ghost"" node that has a simple label like (""see grandfather"") and points to the grandfather.

In order to do calculations you may need to improve your logic to handle cyclic graphs so that a node is not visited more than once if there is a cycle.The most important thing is to avoid creating a problem, so I believe that you should use a direct relation to avoid having a cycle.

As @markmywords said, #include ""fritzl.h"".

Finally I have to say recheck your data structure. Maybe something is going wrong over there (maybe a bidirectional linked list solves your problem).Assertions don't survive reality

Usually assertions don't survive the contact with real world data. It's a part of the process of software engineering to decide, with which data you want to deal and which are out of scope.

Cyclic family graphs

Regarding family ""trees"" (in fact it are full blown graphs, including cycles), there is a nice anecdote:


  I married a widow who had a grown daughter. My father, who often visited us, fell in love with my step-daughter and married her. As a result, my father became my son, and my daughter became my mother. Some time later, I gave my wife a son, who was the brother of my father, and my uncle. My father's wife (who is also my daughter and my mother) got a son. As a result, I got a brother and  a grandson in the same person. My wife is now my grandmother, because she is my mother's mother. So I am the husband of my wife, and at the same time the step-grandson of my wife. In other words, I'm my own grandpa.


Things get even more strange, when you take surrogates or ""fuzzy fatherhood"" into account. 

How to deal with that

Define cycles as out-of-scope

You could decide that your software should not deal with such rare cases. If such a case occurs, the user should use a different product. This makes dealing with the more common cases much more robust, because you can keep more assertions and a simpler data model.

In this case, add some good import and export features to your software, so the user can easily migrate to a different product when necessary. 

Allow manual relations

You could allow the user to add manual relations. These relations are not ""first-class citizens"", i.e. the software takes them as-is, doesn't check them and  doesn't handle them in the main data model. 

The user can then handle rare cases by hand. Your data model will still stay quite simple and your assertions will survive.

Be careful with manual relations. There is a temptation to make them completely configurable and hence create a fully configurable data model. This will not work: Your software will not scale, you will get strange bugs and finally the user interface will become unusable. This anti-pattern is called ""soft coding"", and ""The daily WTF"" is full of examples for that.

Make your data model more flexible, skip assertions, test invariants

The last resort would be making your data model more flexible. You would have to skip nearly all assertions and base your data model on a full blown graph. As the above example shows, it is easily possible to be your own grandfather, so you can even have cycles.

In this case, you should extensively test your software. You had to skip nearly all assertions, so there is a good chance for additional bugs.

Use a test data generator to check unusual test cases. There are quick check libraries for Haskell, Erlang or C. For Java / Scala there are ScalaCheck and Nyaya. One test idea would be to simulate a random population, let it interbreed at random, then let your software first import and then export the result. The expectation would be, that all connections in the output are also in the input and vice verse. 

A case, where a property stays the same is called an invariant. In this case, the invariant is the set of ""romantic relations"" between the individuals in the simulated population. Try to find as much invariants as possible and test them with randomly generated data. Invariants can be functional, e.g.:


an uncle stays an uncle, even when you add more ""romantic relations""
every child has a parent
a population with two generations has at least one grand-parent


Or they can be technical:


Your software will not crash on a graph up to 10 billion members (no matter how many interconnections)
Your software scales with O(number-of-nodes) and O(number-of-edges^2)
Your software can save and re-load every family graph up to 10 billion members


By running the simulated tests, you will find lots of strange corner cases. Fixing them will take a lot of time. Also you will lose a lot of optimizations, your software will run much slower. You have to decide, if it is worth it and if this is in the scope of your software.Instead of removing all assertions, you should still check for things like a person being his/her own parent or other impossible situations and present an error. Maybe issue a warning if it is unlikely so the user can still detect common input errors, but it will work if everything is correct.

I would store the data in a vector with a permanent integer for each person and store the parents and children in person objects where the said int is the index of the vector. This would be pretty fast to go between generations (but slow for things like name searches). The objects would be in order of when they were created.Duplicate the father (or use symlink/reference).

For example, if you are using hierarchical database:

$ #each person node has two nodes representing its parents.
$ mkdir Family
$ mkdir Family/Son
$ mkdir Family/Son/Daughter
$ mkdir Family/Son/Father
$ mkdir Family/Son/Daughter/Father
$ ln -s Family/Son/Daughter/Father Family/Son/Father
$ mkdir Family/Son/Daughter/Wife
$ tree Family
Family
└── Son
    ├── Daughter
    │   ├── Father
    │   └── Wife
    └── Father -> Family/Son/Daughter/Father

4 directories, 1 fileAnother mock serious answer for a silly question:

The real answer is, use an appropriate data structure. Human genealogy cannot fully be expressed using a pure tree with no cycles. You should use some sort of graph. Also, talk to an anthropologist before going any further with this, because there are plenty of other places similar errors could be made trying to model genealogy, even in the most simple case of ""Western patriarchal monogamous marriage."" 

Even if we want to ignore locally taboo relationships as discussed here, there are plenty of perfectly legal and completely unexpected ways to introduce cycles into a family tree.

For example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage

DAQ Software Alternative [closed],"Questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, library or favorite off-site resource are off-topic for Stack Overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it. Closed 8 years ago. I wanted to get NI USB-6008 DAQ but I don't want to burn a hole in my wallet buying LABView. Are there any alternatives to LABView as DAQ software for this card? Is it possible to use Visual C++ Express or OS software like BioMOBIUS with this DAQ card?Yes, the USB-6008 supports both ANSI-C or .NET control WITHOUT Labview, LabWindows, or Measurement Studio although these are certainly great options as well.

You'd use the NI-DAQmx library.

Reference:

See page 7 and 8 of the USB-6008 manual here:
http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/371303l.pdfNI offer Measurement Studio that allows you to use their DAQ devices with Visual Studio. I'm not sure if you can use it with Visual C++ Express but as it's a .net library I'd expect it to work.

From the NI Website:


  Measurement Studio is an integrated measurement solution of tools
  created specifically for V isual Studio .NET programmers. It is
  designed for engineers and scientists building test, measurement, and
  control applications in Visual Studio 2010/2008/2005.


Measurment Studio is not free (as pointed out by @BenVoigt, thanks Ben) but is less than half the price of LabVIEW Base. I understand that it will give you access to many of the visual controls and indicators similar to LabVIEW but this does come at a price and if they are not needed then there are better options.

For a free option the NI-DAQmx library as mentioned by @crlanglois looks a much better choice.One of the cost effective alternative is pyDAQmx : http://pythonhosted.org/PyDAQmx/Visual DAQ is a customized alternative to LABView.",,,,,1,316,66.13,8.9,27.79,54.64,22.57,25.32,79.43,59.81,45.25,8.86,4.43,1.9,0.32,1.27,0,0.95,4.43,9.81,5.38,3.48,12.97,7.28,3.16,8.86,1.27,13.61,6.65,3.16,3.8,0.32,2.22,1.27,17.09,0.32,16.77,2.53,2.53,1.58,4.75,0.32,8.23,0,4.11,3.16,0.95,0.63,0,0.63,0,0,0,0,6.65,4.11,0.32,0.32,0,0.32,2.22,2.53,0,0,0,0,1.9,0,0,1.9,7.28,0,0,6.01,1.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.63,0.63,0,0.32,0,0,0,0.63,4.43,6.33,0.95,0.32,2.53,2.53,0,0,0.95,2.22,6.96,0.63,0.95,0.63,0.32,0,0,20.57,6.65,2.53,0.63,0,1.58,9.18,
DGPR related issue,"Hi,



	On January 20, 2022, the Regional Court of ""Munich I"" confirmed the illegality of the remote integration of Google Fonts in its ruling (Ref.: 3 O 17493/20). As a result, the number of warning letters has increased significantly since then, and more and more private individuals and warning law firms are using the ruling to claim damages.



	The reason for my post is that the default invision board is loading one font from here:
https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/inter/v12/UcC73FwrK3iLTeHuS_fvQtMwCp50KnMa1ZL7W0Q5nw.woff2



	Is there a chance to avoid this somehow? I mean I could look in to the sources and patch it by myself, but this would not help other users and I personally dislike the idea mess around with others code.

DITA for documenting software libraries,"While this is not a question about DITA ""programming"" I'd still like to ask it within the stackoverflow community where most users would happen to be developers. Our company uses a combination of Doxygen & MediaWiki to document software libraries (such as QSchematic). We feel like MediaWiki is not a good way of documenting software libraries. My question: Should I start using DITA to document software libraries? I've spend quite a few hours working with DITA and DITA-OT and I think it's a good solution for documenting software components that the end users directly interacts with (eg. command line tools). However, I'm not quite sure whether DITA is a nice solution to document software libraries. After quite a lot of research it seems like DITA is not widely used by software (library) developers. DITA provides specialization that would allow setting up custom topics for this purpose but as nobody else on the web seems to be doing that I'm wondering whether there's anything fundamentally wrong with using DITA for this purpose.DITA could be a good fit and provides all features you need or could need in the future. Maybe a tool like read-the-docs or Swagger would also fit, but that depends on the documents you want to create, so is difficult to answer without knowing your libraries and content. DITA has the benefit of reuse and flexibility. You can use external code fragments, reuse parts of your reference docs in conceptual topics and task topics giving you the power to achieve anything you could imagine.",,,,,1,255,52.65,25.29,27.97,20.23,23.18,26.67,81.57,63.14,52.55,11.37,6.27,2.75,0.78,2.75,0,0,5.1,12.55,6.27,0,14.12,9.41,5.88,7.45,1.96,18.04,2.35,3.14,4.31,1.18,1.96,1.18,24.71,0.78,23.14,5.1,3.92,4.71,6.27,0,5.49,0,3.92,1.96,1.96,1.18,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,8.24,3.92,0,0,0,0.39,1.57,3.92,0,0,0,0,2.75,0,0,2.75,5.49,0,0,5.1,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.78,0.39,0,0,0,0,0.39,0,1.18,4.31,4.31,0,0,3.92,0,0,0.39,2.35,0.78,7.45,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,14.12,4.71,1.57,0.39,0,2.35,5.1,
Database Records Canonical Meta Tag,"Good Day!


	I don't know if it is possible but...


	When a record is created, you have the option of posting that record as a thread within a specified forum. If you utilize that option, both creations come with a canonical tag that gives the 'thread' preference. I have a want for it to be the opposite, I would like the ""Record"" to have the canonical link direction. Any way to achieve this?


	TYIASorry, this is not currently possible. If you would like to see this in a future release, please leave your suggestion in our official Feature Suggestion forum for further evaluation.Thank you.


	IMO, having Google being directed to not rank the database pages kind of defeats the whole underlying purpose of a CMS system.As mentioned, you would need to post a topic requesting a change within the suggestions area. From a support standpoint, thats the way the system is set up at the present timeSo... I have discovered an item with regard to this canonical meta tag system.



	I have found that if I mark the database as posting a ""topic"" to a forum and then mark whatever category as to 'overriding the database forum options' and deselect 'post topic', the canonical tag on the database record will post a canonical meta tag that directs the record to have prominence.


	Additionally, in this scenario, a forum topic is still created. And, the canonical tag that is created with the forum topic gives that canonical meta tag direction to that forum topic.


	Not sure it is good to have two pages, almost identical, each dictating that they are the prominent version (as Google states that they will ignore one of them), but my records are showing up in Google News.

There were also a couple other interesting open databases at http://infochimps.org/, http://theinfo.org/ and http://www.datawrangling.com/some-datasets-available-on-the-webSecunia, the security company, has a tool called Secunia PSI that attempts to list all the software on a Windows computer and checks it against a database of known vulnerabilities, so you can keep your stuff up to date.  This might have some overlap with what you are trying to do.If anyone's also looking, try wikidata.org - they have a fantastic online query editor you can use to probe around the data set.

"Definition of ""downstream"" and ""upstream""","I've started playing with Git and have come across the terms ""upstream"" and ""downstream"".  I've seen these before but never understood them fully.  What do these terms mean in the context of SCMs (Software Configuration Management tools) and source code?In terms of source control, you're downstream when you copy (clone, checkout, etc) from a repository. Information flowed ""downstream"" to you.
When you make changes, you usually want to send them back ""upstream"" so they make it into that repository so that everyone pulling from the same source is working with all the same changes. This is mostly a social issue of how everyone can coordinate their work rather than a technical requirement of source control. You want to get your changes into the main project so you're not tracking divergent lines of development.
Sometimes you'll read about package or release managers (the people, not the tool) talking about submitting changes to ""upstream"". That usually means they had to adjust the original sources so they could create a package for their system. They don't want to keep making those changes, so if they send them ""upstream"" to the original source, they shouldn't have to deal with the same issue in the next release.When you read in git tag man page:


  One important aspect of git is it is distributed, and being distributed largely means there is no inherent ""upstream"" or ""downstream"" in the system.


, that simply means there is no absolute upstream repo or downstream repo.

Those notions are always relative between two repos and depends on the way data flows:

If ""yourRepo"" has declared ""otherRepo"" as a remote one, then:


you are pulling from upstream ""otherRepo"" (""otherRepo"" is ""upstream from you"", and you are ""downstream for otherRepo"").
you are pushing to upstream (""otherRepo"" is still ""upstream"", where the information now goes back to).


Note the ""from"" and ""for"": you are not just ""downstream"", you are ""downstream from/for"", hence the relative aspect.



The DVCS (Distributed Version Control System) twist is: you have no idea what downstream actually is, beside your own repo relative to the remote repos you have declared.


you know what upstream is (the repos you are pulling from or pushing to)
you don't know what downstream is made of (the other repos pulling from or pushing to your repo).


Basically:

In term of ""flow of data"", your repo is at the bottom (""downstream"") of a flow coming from upstream repos (""pull from"") and going back to (the same or other) upstream repos (""push to"").



You can see an illustration in the git-rebase man page with the paragraph ""RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE"":

It means you are pulling from an ""upstream"" repo where a rebase took place, and you (the ""downstream"" repo) is stuck with the consequence (lots of duplicate commits, because the branch rebased upstream recreated the commits of the same branch you have locally).  

That is bad because for one ""upstream"" repo, there can be many downstream repos (i.e. repos pulling from the upstream one, with the rebased branch), all of them having potentially to deal with the duplicate commits.

Again, with the ""flow of data"" analogy, in a DVCS, one bad command ""upstream"" can have a ""ripple effect"" downstream.



Note: this is not limited to data.

It also applies to parameters, as git commands (like the ""porcelain"" ones) often call internally other git commands (the ""plumbing"" ones). See rev-parse man page:


  Many git porcelainish commands take mixture of flags (i.e. parameters that begin with a dash '-') and parameters meant for the underlying git rev-list command they use internally and flags and parameters for the other commands they use downstream of git rev-list. This command is used to distinguish between them.Upstream (as related to) Tracking

The term upstream also has some unambiguous meaning as comes to the suite of GIT tools, especially relative to tracking

For example :


   $git rev-list --count --left-right ""@{upstream}""...HEAD
   >4   12

  
  will print (the last cached value of) the number of commits behind (left) and ahead (right) of your current working branch, relative to the (if any) currently tracking remote branch for this local branch. It will print an error message otherwise:

    >error: No upstream branch found for ''




As has already been said, you may have any number of remotes for one local repository, for example, if you fork a repository from github, then issue a 'pull request', you most certainly have at least two: origin (your forked repo on github) and upstream (the repo on github you forked from). Those are just interchangeable names, only the 'git@...' url identifies them.

   [remote ""origin""]
       fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
       url = git@github.com:myusername/reponame.git
   [remote ""upstream""]
       fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
       url = git@github.com:authorname/reponame.git




On the other hand, @{upstream}'s meaning for GIT is unique : 



  it is 'the branch' (if any) on 'said remote', which is tracking the 'current branch' on your 'local repository'. 
  
  It's the branch you fetch/pull from whenever you issue a plain git fetch/git pull, without arguments.


Let's say want to set the remote branch origin/master to be the tracking branch for the local master branch you've checked out. Just issue :


   $ git branch --set-upstream  master origin/master
   > Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.

  
  This adds 2 parameters in .git/config :

   [branch ""master""]
       remote = origin
       merge = refs/heads/master

  
  now try (provided 'upstream' remote has a 'dev' branch)

   $ git branch --set-upstream  master upstream/dev
   > Branch master set up to track remote branch dev from upstream.

  
  .git/config now reads:

   [branch ""master""]
       remote = upstream
       merge = refs/heads/dev

  
  git-push(1) Manual Page :

   -u
   --set-upstream

  
  For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less git-pull(1) and other commands. For more information, see branch.<name>.merge in git-config(1).
  
  git-config(1) Manual Page :

   branch.<name>.merge

  
  Defines, together with branch.<name>.remote, the upstream branch for the given branch. It tells git fetch/git pull/git rebase which branch to merge and can also affect git push (see push.default). 
  \
  (...)

   branch.<name>.remote

  
  When in branch < name >, it tells git fetch and git push which remote to fetch from/push to. It defaults to origin if no remote is configured. origin is also used if you are not on any branch.


Upstream and Push (Gotcha)

take a look at git-config(1) Manual Page


   git config --global push.default upstream
   git config --global push.default tracking  (deprecated)

  
  This is to prevent accidental pushes to branches which you’re not ready to push yet.That's a bit of informal terminology.

As far as Git is concerned, every other repository is just a remote.

Generally speaking, upstream is where you cloned from (the origin). Downstream is any project that integrates your work with other works.

The terms are not restricted to Git repositories.

For instance, Ubuntu is a Debian derivative, so Debian is upstream for Ubuntu.Upstream Called Harmful

There is, alas, another use of ""upstream"" that the other answers here are not getting at, namely to refer to the parent-child relationship of commits within a repo. Scott Chacon in the Pro Git book is particularly prone to this, and the results are unfortunate. Do not imitate this way of speaking.

For example, he says of a merge resulting a fast-forward that this happens because


  the commit pointed to by the branch you merged in was directly
  upstream of the commit you’re on


He wants to say that commit B is the only child of the only child of ... of the only child of commit A, so to merge B into A it is sufficient to move the ref A to point to commit B. Why this direction should be called ""upstream"" rather than ""downstream"", or why the geometry of such a pure straight-line graph should be described ""directly upstream"", is completely unclear and probably arbitrary. (The man page for git-merge does a far better job of explaining this relationship when it says that ""the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit."" That is the sort of thing Chacon should have said.)

Indeed, Chacon himself appears to use ""downstream"" later to mean exactly the same thing, when he speaks of rewriting all child commits of a deleted commit:


  You must rewrite all the commits downstream from 6df76 to fully remove
  this file from your Git history


Basically he seems not to have any clear idea what he means by ""upstream"" and ""downstream"" when referring to the history of commits over time. This use is informal, then, and not to be encouraged, as it is just confusing.

It is perfectly clear that every commit (except one) has at least one parent, and that parents of parents are thus ancestors; and in the other direction, commits have children and descendants. That's accepted terminology, and describes the directionality of the graph unambiguously, so that's the way to talk when you want to describe how commits relate to one another within the graph geometry of a repo. Do not use ""upstream"" or ""downstream"" loosely in this situation.

[Additional note: I've been thinking about the relationship between the first Chacon sentence I cite above and the git-merge man page, and it occurs to me that the former may be based on a misunderstanding of the latter. The man page does go on to describe a situation where the use of ""upstream"" is legitimate: fast-forwarding often happens when ""you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed no local changes, and now you want to update to a newer upstream revision."" So perhaps Chacon used ""upstream"" because he saw it here in the man page. But in the man page there is a remote repository; there is no remote repository in Chacon's cited example of fast-forwarding, just a couple of locally created branches.]Using the analogy of a river, we can follow a resource upstream from us until we find the headwaters (the source of a stream or river).
Continuing with the river analogy, downstream is the direction that the water in a river flows. Downhill.
So, if I fork someone's project, The project I forked is upstream. And my fork is downstream.
if someone forks my forked project, Then my fork becomes upstream relative to the fork of my project.
And the fork of my fork becomes downstream.
Example Time!

Suppose Project B forked Project A and Project C forked Project B.
Then, Project A is the upstream project.
Project B is the downstream project relative to Project A.
Project B is the upstream project relative to Project C.
Project C is the downstream project relative to Project B.
And the circle of life continues.
NOTE: Please note that, this is a rather common development style in open source projects to create a fork of a project, fix a bug or add a feature in that fork and then submit a patch to the original project.
Also note that, a clear lesson from the “quality movement” and statistical process control is that interventions that fix quality problems at their source are almost always a better investment than repeated work to fix problems that were preventable. So please contribute patches (send Pull requests).",,,,,1,1873,76.71,57.26,42.54,22.91,24.32,23.28,75.76,62.73,49.49,9.18,4.97,0.64,0.21,2.83,0.37,0.91,4.22,14.63,8.38,1.12,13.35,7.21,5.34,5.71,1.23,16.23,4.7,2.19,3.2,0.69,0.8,1.71,14.95,1.28,13.67,1.98,3.26,1.12,2.99,0.59,4.43,0,1.01,0.59,0.37,0.32,0,0.27,0,0.11,0,0,8.81,2.56,0.27,0.21,0.11,0,1.39,6.14,0.37,0,0,0.8,0.11,0,0,0.11,2.3,0.05,0,2.24,0.05,0,0.43,0.05,0.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.37,0.69,0,0.16,0,0.05,0.21,0.16,3.74,8.06,0.11,2.19,5.5,0.43,0,0.05,3.84,2.14,7.53,0.69,0.11,0.11,0.05,0,0,30.22,6.03,4.06,0.05,0.05,2.14,17.89,

	No. This is a CKEditor bug and it occurs from the beginning! And you probably know it well because it has been reported more than once. 😉



	It is the same with user mentions, you cannot delete them either. And another bug is with emoji, if we add an emoji and a new line, then the emoji is just pressed onto the icon, but we can no longer remove it or return to the line above.



	I've tested it on many browsers and mobile devices and it's always the same.

Deleting spam profiles,"Hello there. I've been extremely lax regarding my forum members. For years, I didn't pay any attention to new members. But recently I have started paying more attention, and realised I have hundreds of spam profiles, 99% of them from India.



	I'd been puzzled for ages about why so many people from India signed up but never posted anything. But because anything they posted would have to be moderated by me, I wasn't concerned. Foolishly I'd never noticed all these accounts had blatant spam links and adverts for all sorts of rubbish including massage parlours in Vietnam in the About Me section.



	So now I'm manually going through each of my 6,500 members and flagging them all as spam. I have a few questions, please, that I would appreciate an answer to -



	1: Could there be any issue with me flagging so many users as spammers in such rapid succession? I must have flagged 50 yesterday in 4 hours, with some of the accounts having been created 2 to 3 years ago. This is just a slight concern, I'm just wondering if ironically Invisions' antispam system could think I am spamming them 🙂



	2: Am I correct in thinking that these accounts should definitely be disabled and deleted in the sense that they are potentially doing my forum some SEO harm? I presume at least that thinning out hundreds of spam profiles would relieve some resources or database space?



	3: Is there a more efficient method of routing out all of these profiles other than literally going through every single one of them? I spent about 4 hours doing it yesterday, and expect to be doing it all day today, and possibly tomorrow as well. Is there a way for example to pull out only profiles that have filled in their about me section, or all members that have never posted anything?



	And finally, once I have flagged them all as spam, and their accounts have been locked, am I correct in thinking that the best thing is to completely delete all of the accounts to alleviate any space they are taking up in the database, and if so, I can only see how I can delete them all one at a time, which unless there is a better way is another laborious task.



	Many thanks, and I apologise for asking multiple questions

			1: Could there be any issue with me flagging so many users as spammers in such rapid succession? I must have flagged 50 yesterday in 4 hours, with some of the accounts having been created 2 to 3 years ago. This is just a slight concern, I'm just wondering if ironically Invisions' antispam system could think I am spamming them 🙂

	There would be no problem with flagging multiple spammers on the system it a small space of time

	They should be removed on the basis they are spam accounts. Whether or not they would affect SEO would depend on what has been being posted on your site. If you have hundreds that have all been posting, then it would of course be taking space.

Designing the software and Architecture of the software subtasks,"I'm new in this field and I'm trying to create a project design. as two milestones, I've defined and as the subtasks/ activities, I've considered Creating the component diagram Creating Behavioral UML Diagram Creating Structural UML Diagram Is it correct?This sequential approach sounds very theoretical. In practice, architecture and design are linked and the architecture emerges in the early stage of the work as the design progresses.
This being said, the system theory defines a system to have a boundary with its environment, to be made of parts in interaction to achieve the system's goals. From an architectural point of view,  the main parts are called usually ""components"", when they are well defined and self-standing.
In a classic UML view, you would first start to define the boundaries and the goals of the system, with a use-case diagram. Because all the rest has not meaning without this core understanding.
Then indeed you'd identify and model main components, then break down the components into smaller components, and so on,  until you get to some detailed class diagrams. The bridge between components and classes is the composite structure.  In the same time, at each level, you would also design the interactions between the components or the objects of different classes, as well as other behavioral aspects.
In the early thinking about a system, it is however not always easy to be as precise and accurate as UML requires.  Representing for example a web architecture with some components on the client, and a bunch of services on the server is not easy to express simply in UML.  This is why, more and more, alternative lighter modelling approaches are used, such as for example the C4 model:  C4 allows to have a less formal high level vision on the architecture, that is easily and quickly reengineered, and when it's stable enough, you may consider to dig down further in UML.",,,,,1,317,85.1,27.96,60.31,54.53,24.38,26.5,79.5,65.3,54.57,6.31,3.15,1.26,0,1.58,0,0.32,3.15,17.35,11.04,1.26,16.4,7.89,5.05,10.09,0.95,12.93,7.26,3.79,3.47,0,3.15,0.32,12.93,0.32,12.62,4.1,2.21,0.95,1.58,0.63,3.79,0,2.21,2.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.47,1.26,0,0,0,0,0.63,2.21,0,0,0,0,0.32,0,0,0.32,2.52,0,0,2.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0,0.32,0,0.32,0,0.63,0,1.26,2.84,8.2,0,0.95,5.99,0.95,0.32,0,4.42,2.21,5.68,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,15.77,4.1,7.26,0.32,0,2.21,1.89,

Detecting AdBlocking software?,"I was recently visiting a site and noticed that the page had a section that said it noticed that I was using AdBlocking software and could I kindly turn it off to help support a small site like that.
I was just wondering how you would do that?  Would it be best done client-side or server-side?This is something that simply can't be done server side - there's zilch reason for person to knock on your door and say ""Look at me, I have AdblockPlus!"". When on the client side, adblock is actively trying to influence the page content, which is something you can see happen and see that they are using an adblocker.

Anyway, I happened to know that newgrounds.com is doing this too. (their new layout was screwed up for adblock plus users - as a response they made a contest for the best ""if you're not going to help us through our ads, go and buy something in the store""-banner.

A quick look in the source of newgrounds told me they are doing this with some simple javascript.
First in the document:

var user_is_leecher = true;

Next there is a external script tag: src=checkabp?thisistotrickabp=***adress of ad affilliate***

Now the joke: they simply trust adblock plus to filter that script out, as all that's in there is: user_is_leecher = false;

From there, they can do just about anything.All off the methods mentioned here rely on the ad blockers to strip out code. This doesn't work for some adblockers(like NetBarrier on Mac). You also have to keep updating your code when the adblockers catch on. 

To detect if the user is blocking ads, all you have to do is find a function in the ad javascript and try testing for it. It doesn't matter what method they're using to block the ad. Here's what it looks like for Google Adsense ads:

if(typeof(window.google_render_ad)==""undefined"") 
{ 
    //They're blocking ads, do something else.
}


This method is outlined here: http://www.metamorphosite.com/detect-web-popup-blocker-software-adblock-spamYou could do it on server side by pairing requests for html pages and for the acording ads (probably with some unique identifiers to each request ...) ... But this is just an idea, i've never tried it and never even seen it used.I found this part in the code which seems to look like how they did it:

/*MOOTOOLS*/
window.addEvent('domready', function(){

$$('.cat-item').each(function(el) { 
    var fx = new Fx.Morph(el,{ duration:300, link:'cancel' }); 
        el.addEvents({ 
        'mouseenter': function() { fx.start({ 'padding-left': 25 }); }, 
        'mouseleave': function() { fx.start({ 'padding-left': 15 }); } 
        }); 
    });

    if ($$("".google-sense468"")[0] && $$("".google-sense468"")[0].clientHeight == 0 && $('block-warning')) $('block-warning').setStyle('display','block');

});
/*MOOTOOLS END*/I guess there are several ways of doing it, but probably the easiest one would be to have some kind of background image, or text, that will be replaced when the ad is loaded. Thus, if the ad gets loaded, you see the ad. If the ad doesn't load, you see the text.

This example would be client side, done by either JavaScript or just plain CSS might even suffice.

There might be some server-side gimmicks that could do this too, but they would be unnecessarily elaborate and clunky. One method that springs to mind would include some kind of API with the advertiser that could be asked ""did the user from IP such.and.such load any images?"" and in that way get the answer. But I doubt there's such services - it would be much easier to do on the client side.I believe that is much easier to do it on client side than in server side. Ad blockers are installed on the client, so they can manipulate DOM and block ajax requests. That's why I believe it makes more sense to detect on the client than on the server.

Anyway, this is a standalone simple plugin that detects users with ad blockers enabled, it's open-source and the full code is on github:

https://github.com/retargetly/mockingbird

It's more publisher oriented so they can easily show messages on the ads containers or in a popup. The plugin is frequently updated, and it's worth a try. This is the fiddle also:

http://jsfiddle.net/retargetly/9vsha32h/

The only method you need to use is

mockingbird.adsBlocked(Obj)


The call can be done anywhere in the code and you don't need jQuery to make it work.

Wish you luck !I don't think there is an easy way to do this. What you can do is to create ""trap"". Make a php script listen to a very obvious url like yourdomain.com/ad.png. You can probably achieve this by url rewriting. If this page is loaded you can note this in a session variable and send back a 1x1 blank png. 

On the next request you can see whether ad.png has been loaded. If it hasn't you can guess that the client is using some form of AdBlock software. Make sure you set the appropriate http headers to prevent clients from caching ""ad.png"".

This is the only server side approach I can think of at the moment and it has some flaws.


The png file can be cached regardless of the http headers
This will not work for the first http request
Some extra server load as browsers will keep hitting ad.png for each request
That the image gets loaded from the server is no guarantee for it actually being displayed 
Probably more side effects that I haven't thought of


Please make a comment on this post if you decide to try it out. 

Regarding a client side solution. This shouldn't be to difficult. You can create a tiny Javascript to run on page load complete. This script can check that the page contains the dom-nodes holding the ads. If you this when the page is loaded completely (not only the dom) you can check the width and height of your ad images. The most obvious drawback with this solution is that clients can disable javascripts.A few good answers here, so I'll just add this:

use some ad management system (You can write Your own). With that, track every ad that's being displayed (and make it obvious, like ads.php or showad.php or whatever). If that script is never called, the user is using SOME form of ad blocking software.

Be sure to handle each and every ad through that handler, though. Mod_Rewrite isn't required, it can be done using simple PHP.What you can do to detect the adblocker on the server-side is somithing like:

<?php

  header('Content-Type: application/javascript');

  //Save it to session
  session_start();
  $_SESSION['noAdblocker']=true;

 ?>

 noAdblocker=true;


Save this file as ads.php

Now the index.php:

<?php
  session_start();
  $_SESSION['noAdblocker']=false;
?>
<!DOCTYPE HTML><html><head>
    <!-- Now place the ""ad-script"" -->
    <script src=""ads.php""></script>
</head><body></body></html>You can add javascript-code to your page, that is only executed if there's no adblocker, e.g. use ""ad"" as variable-name, use ""ad.js"" as file-name. 
This code sends an ajax-event to the server, saying ""this user doesn't use an adlocker"". So if you don't receive that event, you know, that this user is blocking ads or even javascript altogether.",,,,,1,1221,39.03,42.47,10.27,19.26,24.92,17.12,79.12,64.05,52.99,12.78,5.08,1.47,0.16,2.46,0,0.98,7.7,15.23,6.8,1.15,10.24,12.12,5.24,5.49,1.64,19.49,3.52,3.11,2.7,0.49,1.23,0.98,15.89,1.23,14.33,2.38,2.29,3.28,3.11,0.66,3.77,0,2.7,1.31,1.39,1.23,0.08,1.15,0,0,0.9,0,7.45,2.78,0.41,0.66,0,0,1.31,4.67,0,0,0,0,1.97,0,0,1.97,3.28,0.08,0.16,2.87,0.16,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.57,0.08,0.41,0.08,0.33,0,0,0.16,0.33,5.16,7.37,1.23,0.49,4.26,1.56,0.08,0.08,2.05,2.13,7.37,1.23,1.15,1.15,0,0,0,36.45,7.37,3.19,0.66,0.33,4.5,20.39,

BSD: You can use the code.

LGPL: You can use the code, and changes to the code must be released.

GPL: You must release your code.

Mind you, none of these licenses prevent you from selling your product. It's just the GPL would require you to give the source code to anybody you sold the product to.I'll state what's been too obvious to state so far: non-OSS products will mostly not restrict you in terms of products developed using them. That's what you bought them for, after all.

The restrictions would be in terms of redistributing their libraries, and even then, a certain level of redistribution rights will likely be permitted.The BSD license allows you to do this; the GPL generally does not. There are a wide variety of other ""open source"" licenses with various restrictions, but those two are commonly used.

Difference Between Cohesion and Coupling,"What is the difference between cohesion and coupling? How can coupling and cohesion lead to either good or poor software design? What are some examples that outline the difference between the two, and their impact on overall code quality?Cohesion refers to what the class (or module) can do. Low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions - it is broad, unfocused on what it should do. High cohesion means that the class is focused on what it should be doing, i.e. only methods relating to the intention of the class.

Example of Low Cohesion:

-------------------
| Staff           |
-------------------
| checkEmail()    |
| sendEmail()     |
| emailValidate() |
| PrintLetter()   |
-------------------


Example of High Cohesion:

----------------------------
| Staff                   |
----------------------------
| -salary                 |
| -emailAddr              |
----------------------------
| setSalary(newSalary)    |
| getSalary()             |
| setEmailAddr(newEmail)  |
| getEmailAddr()          |
----------------------------


As for coupling, it refers to how related or dependent two classes/modules are toward each other. For low coupled classes, changing something major in one class should not affect the other. High coupling would make it difficult to change and maintain your code; since classes are closely knit together, making a change could require an entire system revamp.

Good software design has high cohesion and low coupling.High cohesion within modules and low coupling between modules are often regarded as related to high quality in OO programming languages.

For example, the code inside each Java class must have high internal cohesion, but be as loosely coupled as possible to the code in other Java classes.

Chapter 3 of Meyer's Object-Oriented Software Construction (2nd edition) is a great description of these issues.Cohesion is an indication of how related and focused the responsibilities of an software element are. 

Coupling refers to how strongly a software element is connected to other elements.

The software element could be class, package, component, subsystem or a system. And while designing the systems it is recommended to have software elements that have High cohesion and support Low coupling.

Low cohesion results in monolithic classes that are difficult to maintain, understand and reduces re-usablity. Similarly High Coupling results in classes that are tightly coupled and changes tend not be non-local, difficult to change and reduces the reuse.

We can take a hypothetical scenario where we are designing an typical monitor-able ConnectionPool with the following requirements. Note that, it might look too much for a simple class like ConnectionPool but the basic intent is just to demonstrate low coupling and high cohesion with some simple example and I think should help.


support getting a connection
release a connection
get stats about connection vs usage count
get stats about connection vs time
Store the connection retrieval and release information to a database for reporting later.


With low cohesion we could design a ConnectionPool class by forcefully stuffing all this functionality/responsibilities into a single class as below. We can see that this single class is responsible for connection management, interacting with database as well maintaining connection stats.



With high cohesion we can assign these responsibility across the classes and make it more maintainable and reusable.



To demonstrate Low coupling we will continue with the high cohesion ConnectionPool diagram above. If we look at the above diagram although it supports high cohesion, the ConnectionPool is tightly coupled with ConnectionStatistics class and PersistentStore it interacts with them directly. Instead to reduce the coupling we could introduce a ConnectionListener interface and let these two classes implement the interface and let them register with ConnectionPool class. And the ConnectionPool will iterate through these listeners and notify them of connection get and release events and allows less coupling.



Note/Word or Caution: For this simple scenario it may look like an overkill but if we imagine a real-time scenario where our application needs to interact with multiple third party services to complete a transaction: Directly coupling our code with the third party services would mean that any changes in the third party service could result in changes to our code at multiple places, instead we could have Facade that interacts with these multiple services internally and any changes to the services become local to the Facade and enforce low coupling with the third party services.simply, Cohesion represents the degree to which a part of a code base forms a logically single, atomic unit. Coupling, on the other hand, represents the degree to which a single unit is dependent on others. In other words, it is the number of connections between two or more units. The fewer the number, the lower the coupling.
In essence, high cohesion means keeping parts of a code base that are related to each other in a single place. Low coupling, at the same time, is about separating unrelated parts of the code base as much as possible.
Types of code from a cohesion and coupling perspective:
Ideal is the code that follows the guideline. It is loosely coupled and highly cohesive. We can illustrate such code with this picture: 
God Object is a result of introducing high cohesion and high coupling. It is an anti-pattern and basically stands for a single piece of code that does all the work at once:

poorly selected takes place when the boundaries between different classes or modules are selected poorly
Destructive decoupling is the most interesting one. It sometimes occurs when a programmer tries to decouple a code base so much that the code completely loses its focus:
read more hereIncreased cohesion and decreased coupling do lead to good software design. 

Cohesion partitions your functionality so that it is concise and closest to the data relevant to it, whilst decoupling ensures that the functional implementation is isolated from the rest of the system. 

Decoupling allows you to change the implementation without affecting other parts of your software.

Cohesion ensures that the implementation more specific to functionality and at the same time easier to maintain.

The most effective method of decreasing coupling and increasing cohesion is design by interface. 

That is major functional objects should only 'know' each other through the interface(s) that they implement. The implementation of an interface introduces cohesion as a natural consequence.

Whilst not realistic in some senarios it should be a design goal to work by.

}best explanation of Cohesion comes from Uncle Bob's Clean Code:

Classes should have a small number of instance variables. Each of the methods of a class should manipulate one or more of those variables. In general the more variables a method manipulates the more cohesive that method is to its class. A class in which each variable is used by each method is maximally cohesive.

In general it is neither advisable nor possible to create such maximally cohesive classes; on the other hand, we would like cohesion to be high. When cohesion is high, it means that the methods and variables of the class are co-dependent and hang together as a logical whole.

The strategy of keeping functions small and keeping parameter lists short can sometimes lead to a proliferation of instance variables that are used by a subset of methods. When this happens, it almost always means that there is at least one other class trying to get out of the larger class. You should try to separate the variables and methods into two or more classes such that the new classes are more cohesive.Cohesion in software engineering is the degree to which the elements of a certain module belong together. Thus, it is a measure of how strongly related each piece of functionality expressed by the source code of a software module is.

Coupling in simple words, is how much one component (again, imagine a class, although not necessarily) knows about the inner workings or inner elements of another one, i.e. how much knowledge it has of the other component.

I wrote a blog post about this, if you want to read up in a little bit more details with examples and drawings. I think it answers most of your questions.cohesion refers all about how a single class is designed. Cohesion is the Object Oriented principle most closely associated with making sure that a class is designed with a single, well-focused purpose.
The more focused a class is, the cohesiveness of that class is more. The advantages of high cohesion is that such classes are much easier to maintain (and less frequently changed) than classes with low cohesion. Another benefit of high cohesion is that classes with a well-focused purpose tend to be more reusable than other classes.

In the above image, we can see that in low cohesion only one class is responsible to execute lots of job which are not in common which reduces the chance of re-usability and maintenance. But in high cohesion there is a separate class for all the jobs to execute a specific job, which result better usability and maintenance.Cohesion (Co-hesion) : Co which means together, hesion which means to stick. The System of sticking together of particles of different substances.   

For real-life example:

  Whole is Greater than the Sum of the Parts -Aristotle.  



Cohesion is an ordinal type of measurement and is usually described as “high cohesion” or “low cohesion”. Modules with high cohesion tend to be preferable, because high cohesion is associated with several desirable traits of software including robustness, reliability, reusability, and understandability. In contrast, low cohesion is associated with undesirable traits such as being difficult to maintain, test, reuse, or even understand. wiki   
Coupling is usually contrasted with cohesion. Low coupling often correlates with high cohesion, and vice versa. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and maintainability. wikiI think the differences can be put as the following:


Cohesion represents the degree to which a part of a code base forms a logically single, atomic unit.
Coupling represents the degree to which a single unit is independent from others.
It’s impossible to archive full decoupling without damaging cohesion, and vice versa.


In this blog post I write about it in more detail.Cohesion is an indication of the relative functional strength of a module.


A cohesive module performs a single task, requiring little
interaction with other components in other parts of a program. Stated
simply, a cohesive module should (ideally) do just one thing.

Coupling is an indication of the relative interdependence among modules.


Coupling depends on the interface complexity between modules, the
point at which entry or reference is made to a module, and what data
pass across the interface.

  The degree to which a component is connected to other components and to the external world
OO view: a qualitative measure of the degree to which classes are connected to one another

Cohesion common meaning is that something that sticks together well, is united, which are characterized by strong bond like molecular attraction. However in software design, it means striving for a class that ideally does only one thing, so multiple sub-modules are not even involved. 

Perhaps we can think of it this way. A part has the most cohesion when it is the only part (does only one thing and can't be broken down further). This is what is desired in software design. Cohesion simply is another name for ""single responsibility"" or ""separation of concerns"".

The term coupling on the hand is quite intuitive which means when a module doesn't depend on too many other modules and those that it connects with can be easily replaced for example obeying liskov substitution principle .Coupling = interaction / relationship between two modules...
Cohesion = interaction between two elements within a module.

A software is consisting of many modules. Module consists of elements. Consider a module is a program. A function within a program is a element. 

At run time, output of a program is used as input for another program. This is called module to module interaction or process to process communication. This is  also called as Coupling.

Within a single program, output of a function is passed to another function. This is called interaction of elements within a module. This is also called as Cohesion.

Example: 

Coupling = communication in between 2 different families... 
Cohesion = communication in between father-mother-child within a family.Simply put, cohesion means that a class should represent a single concept.

The public interface of a class is cohesive if all the class features are related to the concept that the class represents.
For example, instead of having CashRegister class, having CashRegister and Coin features cohesion makes it into 2 classes - CashRegister and Coin class.

In coupling, one class depends on another as it uses the objects of the class. 

The problem with high coupling is that it can create side effects. One change in one class could cause an unexpected error in the other class and could break the whole code.

Generally, high cohesion and low coupling is considered high quality OOP.Theory Difference

Cohesion


Cohesion is an indication of relative functional strength of module.
A cohesive module performs a single task, requiring little interaction with other 
components in other parts of program.
A module having high cohesion and low coupling is said to be functionally independent 
of  other module. 


Classification of Cohesion

1.Coincidental  2.Logical   3.Temporal  4.Procedural  5.Communication 6.Sequential 7.Functional

Coupling


Coupling is indication of relative interdependence among modules.
Degree of coupling between two modules depends on their interface complexity.Cohesion represents the relationship within the module, whereas coupling is the indication of the relationships between modules. Increasing in cohesion is good for software but increasing in coupling is avoided for software.
Cohesion represents the functional strength of modules. Coupling represents the independence among modules. In cohesion, module focuses on the single thing. In coupling, modules are connected to the other modules. So, while designing you should strive for high cohesion and low coupling. What is the technical difference between a process and a thread?

"Dijkstra on ""Software Engineering"" [closed]","you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter ""How to program if you cannot.""


I think I agree with this. At least when I reflect on what we were taught, and a lot of literature, I kinda realize that it's aimed to guide people who can't program.I wouldn't agree. For me, software engineering is how to go about attacking complex problem and Getting Things Done which involves more than just writing some code here and there. 

Even if you can program, you need to know about the discipline in the large, etc etc etc. Taking science into engineering is about making decisions on a practical basis with the current technology available, and having a team (large, small or singular) that designs and produces a product that works, here and now.

Computer Science is IMHO a much narrower scope and less of a daily problem when doing software development.

Distributing an OpenCL Software,"I have a software that used OpenCL on the core for optimization purposes , and everything are running fine, and now i´m packaging this software to be installed on other machines. Now , i´m confused, becouse for example, on the machine where the software was build, there is a CPU and two GPU´s and the software works detecting all the devices returned by the OpenCL initialization...so...i need distribute all the OpenCL Dll´s and libraries for all different vendors? Anyone here have an idea what is the best way to distribute a software that uses type of system? Any help will be much appreciated! Kind Regards.OpenCL vendor libraries are now part of each GPU vendor's graphics driver package. They also install and register the common OpenCL.dll when they install the graphics driver so you don't have to distribute OpenCL or its vendor libraries.

This works for AMD/ATI, nVidia and Intel GPUs. But may not work with other GPU vendors. Unfortunately, this only applies to reasonably new GPUs and recent drivers, let's say the last 12-18 months. You have to investigate the following scenarios:


Windows may run the GPU with a generic driver and no vendor specific driver is installed
The driver is outdated by many years and no new driver is installed
There is no new driver
The GPU does not support OpenCL


In all cases the user has to install the latest GPU driver, or if none is available then usually OpenCL isn't available anyway. This is a scenario that has to be done by some installer logic/interaction.

Two problems remain. First, the Intel CPU (with a C) OpenCL package has to be installed manually, if a CPU with SIMD (SSE2/AVX) is to be used as OpenCL platform. This task is similar to installing a GPU driver and this scenario also has to be dealt with by some installer logic. I discourage distributing vendor DLLs from Intel and suggest the proper OpenCL CPU package installer from Intel.

The second problem is if there is no OpenCL installed by any vendor or driver package, then usually the OpenCL.dll is missing as well. Almost always this library is linked dynamically and not on-demand (GetProcAddress) so any application using OpenCL will not load and stop with a DLL not found message box. There is not even a change for the application to report or provide help. The best solution for this is to use load-delay (just specify the OpenCL.lib as load-delay in linker settings) and then perform a generic is-dll-installed-on-system check in the application before the first OpenCL API is called. Then provide reasonable user interaction and support.

Additionally, all 3 mayor vendors have end-user OpenCL distribution packages. Although I still suggest installing the latest driver instead.Your code will be compiled JIT on the target machine. You need to take care that you dispatch your kernels only on available devices. So at runtime your kernels will execute only on those devices which support OpenCL.

Do you follow the Personal Software Process? Does your organization/team follow the Team Sof... [closed],"For more information - Personal Software Process on Wikipedia and Team Software Process on Wikipedia. I have two questions:I went through the training and then my company paid for me to go to Carnegie Mellon and go through the PSP instructor training course to get certified as an instructor.  I think the goal was to use this as part of our company's CMM/CMMI effort.  I met Watts Humphrey and found him to be a kind, gentle soul with some deeply held ideas about process.  I read several of his books as well.

Here's my take on it in a nutshell - it is too structured for most people to follow, assuming you follow things to the letter.  The idea of estimation based on historic info is OK, particularly in the classroom setting, but in the real world where estimates are undone in a day due to the changing tide of requirements and direction, it is far less useful.  I've also done Wide Band Delphi estimation and that was OK but honestly wasn't necessarily any better than the 'best guess' I'd make.

My team was less than enthusiastic about PSP and that is part of the problem - developer buy-in.  My company was doing it for the wrong reason - simply to say ""hey, look we use PSP and have some certified instructors!"".  

In the end, I've found using a 'agile' approach to be better.  I have a backlog of work to do and can generally estimate it pretty well.  I've been doing it long enough that I can make pretty good rough estimates on time and frankly don't think that the time tracking really improves things much.  Perhaps in some environments it would work well, but at my place, we'll keep pumping out quality software without all the process hoops that yield questionable benefits.

Just my two cents.I got into this once, even tried using PSP Dashboard.

It's just too hard to keep up with.  Who wants to use a stop watch for all their activities?  Follow Joel's advice on Painless Scheduling and Evidence Based Scheduling.

+1 this question, -1 to PSP.I have used the PSP and TSP process by heart for 4 years (though it was in the begining of my software career). As an idealist you will love what is being done by you and ofcourse Yes there are amazing results as well. 

Though PSP advocates the recording of your defects to the core (such as ; or typo's), I was in a conversation with Mr. Watts Humphrey where lot of people asked him about the advancements of compilers and missing of object orientedness (which I felt, how is it missing, as I was an OO Programmer and was using it successfully). There was a very good answer provided by him. It went on like, ""PSP, or as a matter of fact any process methodology, is not a concept thats stuck on a single idea. The core idea is to introduce people to the quality methods and analysis. 

""Its always adaptive. You can tailor it to fit to your needs. If you feel like you will go with Function Point methodology, you are alright to go ahead with it. Same for any estimation techniques. But you should do it constantly and repetetively.

""Same with the advancement of compilers. If you feel like the WBS in the structure of PSP won't fit to your development, do modify it and use but again do it constinuously. 

""As you do it continuously, you will have collected the historical data of yours and will be statistically do a predectable and accurate estimates on all the parameters""


May be I am giving this answer late but when I read all the replies, I felt I wanted to share this. 
As per the tools, we have Process Dashboard, the PSP excel sheet and all.For the PSP, I have seen the Software Process Dashboard, but it seems awfully difficult to use.I learned it just this last semester in college and it worked great for me. I know that by following it to the letter I can be confident I can hit Compile and won't have any errors and by hitting Run I won't have to spend time anymore fixing and re-compiling the program to run it again and again till the mess is fixed. 

People complain about having to record the ""missing semi-colons"" and such but by the time you're on program 7, you're no longer making such trivial mistakes and instead your defects are found in the important bits of your program. I have not had the opportunity to apply it to a real scenario though but im really looking forward to!I try to follow the PSP 2.1 process when possible.  It really helps me keep a focus on not skipping important, but less exciting, portions of a project.  Usually this is design and design review for small projects.

To keep track of time you can use the PSP Dashboard, which has a bunch of built in features and scripts that help you follow the process.

If you are just looking for a time-tracking tool, I also like http://slimtimer.com.  It can also do some decent reports.I've been using PSP for the last six months.

It is time consuming. For my estimations I had to spend 7% of my time filling forms.
It is frustating to have to put the mistake ""missing semicolon"" over and over again.

But on the other hand as I get used to the process, it became important as I started to see which errors I was mainly doing and I started ""naturally"" avoiding them.

It also makes you ""review"" your code so you can see if there's any problem before hitting the compile button.

For tools I recommend using Timetracker: http://0xff.net/

I recommend at least trying PSP for a couple of months, because you will create some habits that help reduce the time you spend compiling and correcting minor bugs.I have completed the PSP course, the next one is supposed to be TSP which is meant for team dynamics as others say. I have mixed feelings about PSP (mostly negative, but the results were interesting), I arrived to the following conclusions:


First of all my main source of frustration is that the design templates are way too tedious and impractical. Change them for UML and BPMN, tell your instructors from the start, IMPOSE IF NECESSARY. The book itself says that the design templates are for people who don't know or want to learn UML.
Secondly, estimations were the only valuable part for me. The book itself says that you can use other stuff appart from lines of code and it even tells you how to know how relevant they are statistically. My take on this (counting lines of code) is that a tool/plugin that connects with your VCS (git, mercurial) must exist and automate the building of your personal database, otherwise is too tedious to track base/added/reused parts. 
The process itself is nice, but not applicable to big projects, why?, because it just doesn't cope with iterations. In the real world, due to requirement changes you will always have to reiterate on a project. You can still apply the discipline to small programmatic tasks, this is: plan, design, review your design (have design standards and a small checklist that u can memorize), code, review your code (have clear coding standards and a small mental checklist you can memorize), test, ponder on your mistakes. Any experienced programmer will know these are eventually intuitive steps to follow. My recommendation in real practice: follow the process but don't document other stuff than your design, and if you do implement unit tests, document them well.
This process might actually be worth to follow and practical... for real-time system programming where there is absolutely no room for mistakes, otherwise doesn't feel worth it.
If you are seeking for a methodology to organize and improve focus, try GTD (Get Things Done) and Pomodoro first. 
If you have obsessive-compulsive disorder you might actually enjoy PSP =).


My final recommendation, learn from it as a reference, might lead to better and more practical stuff. This thing is just too academic.

P.S.: R.I.P. Watts HumphreyI followed the PSP for a few weeks some years ago, because my group wanted to experiment with it. I found it very disappointing and even irritating to work with. It exhausted my patience. My main negative points are:


Ridiculous emphasys in things like typos or missing semicolons.
Impractical forms that you have to fill by hand.
Focus on procedural programming instead of OO.
Estimating involves counting the number of loops, functions, etc.


I found it a massive waste of time. I'd rather choose to leave this profession than to be forced to follow the PSP.

Related material: My answer about a PSP book in the ""What programming book would you NOT recommend to developers"" question.I used it during university but at work we really don't have a process at all. Only recently have we started using version control.

Domain Specific Languages in software reuse [closed],"I would like to ask about the advantages of using Domain Specific Languages vs software libraries in software reuse research.

I have read some papers stating that using DSLs is a better approach than using software libraries for software reuse field but without mentioning many reasons.

One reason I read is that DSLs receive direct support from compiler while software libraries do not, I could not understand this issue also.

RegardsYou should read James Neighbor's papers on Draco for an eye-opening view of ""code"" (generation knowledge) reuse and DSLs. 

Jim is the guy who invented the term ""domain analysis"".

The fundamental lesson is that reuse of construction knowledge is more powerful than reuse of code libraries, yet easier to use for the domain expert.

We are aware of an issue with PHP 8 during install, so if thats what you are using, you would need to restart that, and install with 7.4there no message coming. just during installing its switch to white page and he just put TABLE mysql and nothing else.

Eclipse hangs when installing new software,"I am trying to install new software within Eclipse the C++ version. Help -> install new software. When I go to install new software, it hangs or takes hours to move a percentage. I have read that this is a known bug in JRE7, which I am assuming I am using since I have it installed. I changed to JRE6 by changing the eclipse.ini file with the argument -vm XXXX where XXXX is the path to my javaw.exe. It does not seem to have changed anything. Ideas? Thanks.Finally it worked for me only by unchecking Contact all update sites during install to find required software. From what I'm seeing it might be a Mac issue, on Windows and Linux it worked without any change.You can get rid of this problem by simply disabling your Firewall software before installing new plugin. If your Antivirus has built-in Firewall, you need to disable it.

Optionally, to reduce the update time, you can uncheck Contact all update sites during install to find required software, see my blog post for details.I've found it helps by adding this line to the eclipse.ini file:

-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=trueTo install new plugin into eclipse, you can download plugin installer or go market place to install.
Make sure what SDK you are using and fill the correct path.

Email notifications are not sent instantly,"Hi,



	Is there any place I can configure when email about notification is being sent? I talk about any forum or downloads subscriptions where I choose to be notified about reply or new content. I usually get email after an hour some content was posted instead immediately. This issue happens to me since time I upgraded to IPB4.



			
				


	Edited August 16 by PatrickRQFollowed content notifications, if the user has set to receive the notification immediately, should go out relatively immediately. However, of course, you will need to check with your email provider to see if there are any delays there and ensure there isn't any delays on the server too.Just to note, there is an exception to this. If there are lots of followers, these would be queued. However even then, unless you have a lot of other items before them in the queue task, they would go out relatively quickly.Depending on the size of your community, and of course your hosting/smtp configuration - you might want to investigate offloading your mail handling to a service such as Sendgrid. We have over 150,000 active members and our email sending via our own server was stalling, as well as always getting blacklisted and bad sender rep. Since migrating to Sendgrid we have instant email notifications with almost no delay, 99%+ deliverability, and never get blacklisted.

Embedded Media with http (not https) not converted properly during upgrade,"I upgraded from quite an old version to 4.7 and a lot of the old embedded images and youtube links where http and not https. It seems that during upgrade, the post converter has embedded all the old media with https but not the ones with http.



	What I've done is run a MySQL UPDATE to turn the http:// links into https:// on the converted posts table, but is there any way to trigger a re-build the post content?



	Or would I have to do it BEFORE upgrade and run it again? I'd rather not do that as there have been new posts since I upgraded so if there is a way to re-build post content that would be preferable.



	Thank you in advance!



	EDIT: it was 3.3.4 to 4.7.1 🙂 



			
				


	Edited August 24 by PeteAre these attachments uploaded through the software?They're just URLs in the posts that used to either show an embedded external image or URL.



	So here's an example, before the upgrade, the URL that's would have shown the file from the external website. Because it's http and not https, the converter seems to have skipped embedding it in 4.7.1 when rebuilding the content.


	I've seen the same happen with youtube URLs where non-https youtube URLs just show as links after converting but https youtube urls are correctly embedded.

	 



	



	EDIT: I did also check as some of the ones that didn't convert are so old the file/video that was embedded no longer exists (so obviously there's nothing to embed), but the one in this example does still exist at that URL, and definitely would have been displaying as an image  instead of a textual URL pre-upgrade.



			
				


	Edited August 24 by PeteIn ACP -> System -> Posting -> Remote Images, did you opt not to allow these? Did you also not allow secure images? 



	If so, this would be intended as these are remote images and not secure.Ah thanks, but I think it's a different setting actually, bear with me with my line of deductive reasoning 🙂 



	It's the same for Youtube videos that had non-http URLs too. So I think what happens during upgrade is the ""Only allow secure images?"" setting gets ticked on as part of the upgrade process (because I don't think it was an option way back in 3.3.4) and then when the post rebuild happens after the upgrade remote images (which were actually allowed in my settings) any http-only images AND youtube videos that are http-only get skipped because of the ""Only allow secure images?"" setting.



	That's my hunch anyway - the embed part of the post rebuild simply skips anything non-https



	So it sounds like unless there's a way to re-trigger the post rebuild I might have to re-upgrade after changing http to https in all links in my pre-upgrade post table? I'm hoping there's just a way of triggering rebuild as that's easier for me at this point 😬These settings do not exist in version 3. YouTube is a whole different animal as that is a supported rich video embed so can ignore that 🙂 . The remote image setting will only apply to images, not any other URL or embed.



	I'm afraid, there is no way to rebuild these post-upgrade. Why we recommend testing these upgrades 🙂 . If you find this happens again, please let us know though.Thanks Jim - I think there's only been a handful of posts since the upgrade so I think I can probably re-upgrade locally after tweaking the URLs, then simply copy the new post rows into that table and upload that to the live server.

Error 500 in messenger when PHP 8.0 turned on,"Hi, recently I updated my board to 4.7. I saw that I should change my PHP version from 7.4 to 8.0. As I did that everything to works fine except messenger. 



	Msg in modal window are not loading and when I try to go to messenger there is an 500 error (no logs in ACP or I didn't find any). 



	When I go back to PHP 7.4 messenger just starts to work again.



	What should I do? How can I check what's cousing this issue?



	I checked on PHP 8.0 with IPS requirements checker but it's not showing any warnings.Do you have any modifications installed? One of those might be incompatible with PHP 8.0 since it changed how parent classes in theme hooks are handled.



	Try disabling all modifications, switch to PHP 8 and see if the error is gone. If it is, re-enable the modifications 1 by 1 and check when the error appears again. After that contact the developer to let them know so that they can fix it.

	Try disabling the sticky note plugin and see if the error stops.The error is due to a hook in Videos app not being able to load a member/group.



	Sticky Notes is in the position #11 in the log and its hook only loads a JS/CSS. The error is due to #0, which leads to  a hook in #2.

	You have to go extremely slowly with your enabling here. Enough that you know exactly what caused it when you enabled it. It could take some time to show up depending on what it is so I recommend waiting some time, an hour or so between each one. Once you find out which one it is, you will need to contact the author.

	This is something which our team is investigating in relation to PHP 8.



	Reverting to PHP 7.4 may fix the problem for you, until we find the underlying cause.Ugh, thanks.  I hope this is fixed soon as I am on the current release, so I cannot go backwards, and my support runs out in a few days.

	I thought 4.7.1 required 8?  I suspect I am wrong.



	If I leave it at 8, is it going to cause any issues other than loading up the error log?

	Just seeing what is the best way forward, try to run the update again or run the support tool next?



	Many thanks!You would need to contact your hosting company on this issue. The problem you have is a crashed or missing table. In. this case the table core_follow_count_cacheLooks like hosting is not sure why the table just is not there anymore, is there not a way to insert that missing table into the database?

	 



	Just to note that i did change the php to version 7.4

	You would lose all data associated with that table and it may create relationship errors so it would be recommended to restore the complete database.OK, i do have a back up that i can check.



	What about this error is this related or can it be fixed by running the tool



	[[Template forums/front/forums/forumDisplay is throwing an error. This theme may be out of date. Run the support tool in the AdminCP to restore the default theme.]]If you were not able to complete the upgrade, you will need to wait till that is done.



	Essentially, if you apply files but don't run the upgrader, you can expect to see some issues.



	If after you complete the upgrade process, you still see this. You will want to disable all third party applications/plugins and switch to an unmodified theme to see if it still exists.I think that is the issue, the upgrade wont run because of this missing table, but no idea why it just disappeared in the first place as i haven't had any issues before.Sorry, you would need tp work with your hosting provider to understand why it disappeared.Hosting is looking into it, also checking the older database.



	Silly question, but what if i have a fresh board install, then did a migration from one board to another?

			Silly question, but what if i have a fresh board install, then did a migration from one board to another?
		
	



	For our software to convert data from one installation to another, it would need to be on the same release and might end up with a very similar situation with the software attempting to read the missing table still. You can not simply move over your database, like I believe you're asking here, via PHPMyAdmin or something. You would run into a lot more of conflicts.It wouldn't be via phpmyadmin, but what about the migration tool that you have? hoping that would just

	You're more than welcome to try our converter tools, which can be downloaded from the Client Area, but it may just result in the same error as it will need to read from the same database. Just be sure to take a full backup (files and folders) prior to attempting anything.OK will give it a shot, many thanks for your help.You're very welcome.I know that you mentioned about running the upgrade first (which i cant do at the moment), but what about just switching to the default theme, not sure if that would at least fix the post issue.On 8/29/2022 at 4:14 PM,   Unslaved said:

	You can certainly try that but if you have applied the files for the next release or this is related to the missing table. You either need to revert to a backup and/or re-apply the files from the release you were on.Not sure if would be related to the issue or not, but the upgrade did not run as it couldnt get past the FTP verification.On 8/29/2022 at 4:23 PM,   Unslaved said:

	Sorry, believe I may have been confused by what were you saying. Is this in the automatic upgrade process? Have you tried to upload manually the files?



	To do a manual upgrade, you would do this by downloading a full set of files in the Client Area and exacting them to your computer. Once done, upload the contents of the ""ips_*****"" folders to your server, overwriting what is there. When all files have successfully uploaded, you will want to go to /admin/upgrade to complete the upgrade.Correct this was the auto upgrade, have not tried the manual upgrade yet, but i can test this on a dev install, i take it the board license will allow a test site?On 8/29/2022 at 4:29 PM,   Unslaved said:

	I changed my PHP to 7.4 and it's solved. However if I change the PHP to 8.0 or 8.1 my forum crashes and all I see is an empty white page, is there any way to fix this?



	Thanks!Most likely one (or more) of your applications/plugins is not compatible with PHP 8. Check if there are any updates, if there aren't disable all modifications, switch to PHP 8, and then re-enable the modifications 1 by 1 checking which one is causing issues.



	Or, you can just wait for version 4.7.2 to come out of beta since it contains a tool that can tell you which modifications won't work with PHP 8.There is also the possibility that 8 and 8.1 do not have all the requirements for the platform to run. So it would be worth running the requirement checker while running those versions to check this

Error: Registry key 'Software\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment'\CurrentVersion'? [duplicate],"When I run:
C:\Users\ashahria\Downloads>java -jar schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar I get the error below. What is wrong? How can I fix it? Error: Registry key 'Software\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment'\CurrentVersion' has value '1.5', but '1.7' is required.

Error: could not find java.dll

Error: Could not find Java SE Runtime Environment.On my Windows 7 machine, it was solved by doing the following:


In the START menu type ""regedit"" to open the Registry (be careful doing this)
Go to ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE"" on the left-hand side registry explorer/tree menu
Click ""SOFTWARE"" within the ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE"" registries
Click ""JavaSoft"" within the ""SOFTWARE"" registries
Click ""Java Runtime Environment"" within the ""JavaSoft"" list of registries
Highlight ""CurrentVersion"" (should see it in the main registry key explorer window on the right)
Change version to ""1.7""


That is all... should work. Short of that, if you've already tried some other guides and/or messed up your registries, the most certain way to deal with the problem is to delete all previous versions of Java (using ""Programs and Features"" uninstall process) and then re-install just the version you want to work with. I'd suggest the distribution site at:
http://java.com (as it usually has the most stable version)

Or look for a specific version you need from Oracle's site:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/I had various JDK from 1.5 to 1.7 installed on my PC. I had a need to learn JDK1.8 so installed and my earlier versions of Eclipse (depended on earlier versions of JDK) and I got errors launching my Eclipse IDE, on the command line I tried to check the Java Version and got the error below,

C:\>java -version
Registry key 'Software\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\CurrentVersion'
has value '1.8', but '1.6' is required.
Error: could not find java.dll
Error: could not find Java SE Runtime Environment.



Solution:-
I removed C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath; from the PATH variable and moved %JAVA%\bin to the start of the PATH variable, that solved the problem for me.Go to 'c:/Windows/System32' and delete the java.exe, javaw.exe and javaws.exe there.
See at Registry Key '...' has value '1.7', but '1.6' is required. Java 1.7 is Installed and the Registry is Pointing to itset PATH=c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_45\bin;%PATH% 

this will work if you are working on command promptyou may follow these steps :


set JAVA_HOME to jdk[without bin folder]
set PATH as %JAVA_HOME%/bin;
put java.exe , javaw.exe & javaws.exe to C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath [I was having problem here].
double click on the java.exe
Also check and edit the registry value for JAVA current version if required.


it worked for me :)Your java version is 1.5 (you have jdk 1.5). The jar requires java version 1.7 (you should have jdk 1.7). You should download and install the 1.7 jdk from this website:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.htmlI had Java 1.8 but had to downgrade to Java 1.6 for some reason. When I uninstalled java 1.8 and ran the command ""Java -Version"" from the command prompt, I got the error - 

Error: Registry key 'Software\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment'\CurrentVersion'

has value '1.6', but '1.8' is required.
Error: could not find java.dll
Error: Could not find Java SE Runtime Environment.

Uninstalling 1.6 and then reinstalling 1.6 fixed the issue for me :-)Adjust the sequence of your environment variable %path% to make sure jre 1.7 is the default one.One Good solution is to restart the PC, this will make the right entry in the Registry of the PC. Restarting solves my problemJust Reinstall JDK 1.7 it will work.I tried the steps mentioned by @bcmoney but for me the current version was already set to the latest version. In my it was Java8.

I had various versions of java installed (java6, java7 and java8). I got the same error but instead of 1.5 and 1.7 i got 1.7 and 1.8. I uninstalled java6 on my windows 8.1 machine. After which i tried java -version in command prompt and the error did not appear.

I am not sure whether this is the right answer but it worked for me so i thought it would help the community too.I just uninstalled my Java8 update and tried again. It worked ok!I ran into this issue after updating the Java JDK, but had not yet restarted my command prompt.  After restarting the command prompt, everything worked fine. Presumably, because the PATH variable need to be reset after the JDK update.Other times you might have installed Java 7 and 8 both or twice, and from Add/remove programs unistall one of them and it should work.When I run:

Facial recognition/merging software [closed],"Questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, library or favorite off-site resource are off-topic for Stack Overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it. Closed 9 years ago. Can anyone point me in the right direction of some facial recognition libraries & algorithms ? I've tried searching/googling but i mostly find thesises and very little real software.How about Eigenfaces? Utilizes simple mathematics to store recognizable eigenvector of the face and reconstruct faces using multiple vectors.

The code is all available in Python as well here.OpenCV is a great computer vision library.

Here's the OpenCV wiki page on face recognition.In addition to Eigenfaces, I would look at Fisherfaces.  Here is an academic paper that compares the performance of both algorithms Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces.  It shows better performance with Fisherfaces.  I also agree with tfinniga that OpenCV is worth your time, I've used it before for face detection.

Finally you should be more specific.  Do you want to detect when there is a face in a picture and then identify where or do you want to detect a specific face in a picture?  The solutions listed here are for the latter question.  If you want to tackle the former question I suggest searching the literature for adaboost and haar features.You're probably not going to find much finished software for face recognition.  If you want to do it, your best chance is to implement something that is in someone's thesis.

About 4 years ago, someone at CMU, I believe, wrote an algorithm that was the most successful face recognition algorithm I have ever seen... I will try to find it for you, unless someone else knows what I am talking about.

If you've never implemented computer vision code before, then you might be able to tackle the problem by breaking it down into a simpler problem.  How many people are you looking for?  If it's a small group of people, could a color-space recognition algorithm work?  If the people have differing skin tones, and differing hair colors, then you might just be able to use basic color-space recognition to get a good result.

Otherwise, you are in for a big project.

EDIT: here's a list of some CMU articles that may point you in the right direction

If I were you, I would read some of those articles, and follow up on the references.This kind of task is usually done using Neural Networks. This is your primary direction to look. 
Also some more specific kind of network for you to look is Kohonen Neural Network. It is the simpliest Image Recognition network, that can be also used in a face recognition tasks. You won't achieve any good results using ONLY this one kind of net, but connecting few of them together. I can't give more detail, as I know this only in theory, but have no practical skills in this area.

Btw, I don't think you will find any libraries for that task, as usually if you have such library - why dont make a product and sell it?I wrote a whole tutorial and demo program with free source code for performing face detection and face recognition in real-time from a webcam (based on Eigenfaces in OpenCV):

Fault tolerant software architecture,"I'm looking for some good articles on fault tolerant software architectures. Could I please have some recommendations.Handbook of Software Reliability Engineering you can read it in pdf. One of the main principles of software reliability is fault tolerance. 

Take a look at chapter 14 Fault-Tolerant software.I found 'Release It!' to be an excellent read.


  In Release It!, Michael T. Nygard shows you how to design and architect your application for the harsh realities it will face. You’ll learn how to design your application for maximum uptime, performance, and return on investment.Link dump! :)

These are some of the on-line things I got some ideas (or just for terminology checkup) from when researching a certain aspect of redundancy.


Fault tolerance techniques for distributed systems (IBM DeveloperWorks)
Understanding Fault-Tolerant Distributed Systems (ACM)
Software-controlled Fault Tolerance (ACM)
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Wikipedia)
Fault-tolerant design (Wikipedia)
Fault-tolerance (Wikipedia)


ACM requires membership.It would be very difficult to sum it up in one article since there are multiple ways to achieve fault tolerance in software. These principles deal with Desktop, Server applications and/or SOA. Also there are multiple methodologies, few of which we already follow without knowing; Exception handling for example. It would be a herculean feat to try to drill down all the concepts in one article. You can find a lot of articles with a simple search on google.

For my FYP, I researched on OS wide Self Healing systems. I followed the Sun Solaris 10 architecture and IBM's Autonomous Computing research (http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/).This article about Software Fault Handling techniques covers the following topics:

File permissions after failed upgrade.,"What _should_ the permissions be on these files? The upgrade failed because some directories didn't have write permission for the process user, but once that's fixed I now get this instead ...They should be readable by the system. This would generally however indicate you dont have the latest files so I would check that before anything elseI downloaded the full suite again as suggested.



	I've run into this issue now every upgrade since we purchased & installed the Commerce add-on, that was a manual install and it's left files with wonky permissions all over the place, so the automatic upgrade doesn't work any more 😞Note, the software will use the standard permissions used by your web server. If you need alternative permissions for specific types of files, I can provide you the constants entries to do that, but you would need to know what those permissions need to be from your hosting company. The issue at present is the software cannot read those filesI run into issues when I copy files in to place because I run IPS inside docker so the user IDs don't match up & the host user doesn't have the right permissions inside Docker. I try and update them but I always miss a couple. Once I've got them all the automated update will work again and I can stop looking for needles in haystacks.Excellent. Glad you were able to find the issue. I would advise keeping a checklist to help you in cases like this if you need to upload files.

"FileNotFoundException during ClickOnce Install, missing HKCU\Software\Classes\Software","One of our users has a very serious problem with ClickOnce. The error is a classic one: But none of the traditional solutions worked. We tried: I published a helloworld app in .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0 and copied the entire \publish folder to his machine. This also did not install, giving the same error. Finally, I went to the registry to try to add enhanced logging per RobinDotNet and realized that HKCU\Software\Classes\Software was completely missing. Following some more threads, I went and renamed UsrClass.dat. However, after logging off and logging in, this was not rebuilt. I suspect this maybe the issue. Any thoughts on how to get ClickOnce working again? This is a reasonably fresh Windows 7 Professional install. Update Here's another clue. We are able to rename UsrClass.dat to anything or delete it without any complaint from Windows - so it is not being loaded. On my machine it complains that it is under use.I would say forget about ClickOnce and get that registry sorted out. This probably isn't a correct topic for StackOverflow, more like SuperUser.com...

Anyway:

1) Try a System Restore, see if you can find a state where that registry hive exists, you might have to go back many weeks.

2) Try exporting that registry hive from your machine and import it into the client machine. See if the error goes away or if it complains about a different hive - it might be possible that the registry is corrupt and there are other hives missing as well...

3) If these two don't fix the problem, then you are better of doing a clean install (it will be faster than looking for the exact cause of the problem and you can be sure that everything will be fixed)

4) Finally uninstall any registry cleaner or pc tuning software. They are known to cause problems, registry corruption being one of them. Also check for hardware issues, the HDD might have developed a bad block(s) or the RAM maybe faulty (run MemTest for 3+ passes to be sure)...Try uninstalling it and then reinstall it ! I'm sure it should work.Try deleting folders under:

C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0\


Except Data folder.

You should delete .NET Framework temporary files too:

If you login and log out, do you still see it?This is still happening notice it more when I switch computers the other computer seems to be signed out.What browser and OS are you using there? Just so I can test in the same environmentSafari, Monterey and Ventura I notice when I hit sign in with email it logs me in but never shows me any fields to fill in.Are you using any plugins at all that you are using on all the devices you see this on?I am still seeing this daily.

	Try logging out from all devices. Then login.no it's something else.



	If I click on ""All Activity"" I am logged in. If I click on Sign In and choose ""Email"" it goes away never prompting for email credentials.I am on Safari (M1 Monterey) and (Intel, Ventura)



		I have disabled all safari's extensions. (1Password )
	
	
		I have disabled any auto fill's.
	
	
		I am not using MacOS / iCloud Passwords 
	
	
		I can click SIGN OUT all day long it shows me as logged out.
	
	
		however I click ""Log in > Sign in With Email"" and NEVER prompted for credentials. 
	
	
		I have cleared browser cache several times.
	
	
		I have restarted browser several times. 
	

	when ever this came in to play I haven't seen a Email / Password field.

	However It has not been explained what is going on here with this Email Sign in it is not the same experience as on my site If I log out and log back in I see the credential input fields.

	Ive Opened those as well, could this be a glitch from migration. I am losing my mind over this. 🥺There is a chance, but it wouldn’t be my first guess. I had such problems myself after conversions, but it was always just faulty permissions somewhere. 



	You could try to narrow down the problem by adding forums. Start fresh with a new category and forum. Does it show up? If yes, the problem is inside the existing forum. If not, there is some global issue affecting all forums. Then possibly proceed by creating a new forum inside that existing category … Stuff like that.

Free install wizard software [closed],"Is there something like InstallShield that I can use for free? I have been using Inno Setup for several years now. It's mature enough that it has a lot of plug-ins. I've found that the forums/newsgroups are very good at answering all the questions I've had so far. NullSoft NSIS http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page WiX (Windows Installer XML) is free. Inno Setup has worked very well as the Zeus installer for many years. I googled for ""free installer"" and found Advanced Installer, which I recall that I have used successfully in the past.+1 for Inno.  I was not a fan of NSIS/Nullsoft.  

EDIT

the reason I did not like NSIS was the hoops I had to jump trough just to get the version information in the installer title/script.  Basically you have to preprocess the scripts or run the install generator twice.  Maybe they fixed it, maybe not.  But what a hassle.

I also found that the versions of the plugins and the versions of the main component were brittle.  For example, things didn't work well when mixed and matched/upgraded.  

We had to keep a specific version of NSIS and the plugins we used in a repository to ensure we had them.Nullsoft Installer is the way to go. It has a bit of a steep learning curve but once you've worked out the scripting you'll have a decent installer in no time. Check out the Eclipse plugin too, it is a great addition.I was looking for a similar solution and found the new kid on the block to be InstallJammer.  Open source, extremely friendly and powerful-looking (I say looking because I never actually finished using it on a project), able to produce installers for multiple platforms.

Actions in particular seemed very easy to set up.

If it were to live up to it's goals, it would easily give the other install solutions a run for their money.I would consider dotNetInstaller as well.

It's pretty easy to setup installation with prerequisites, has a nice wizard and an editor that let manage the xml scripting from a form.There's the open source Nullsoft Installer which began with WinAmp, if I'm not mistaken.

For .NET development you may want to take a look at WiX, which Microsoft also open sourced. IT's good for those with continuous integration setups.NSIS (nullsoft scriptable installer system) will do the job. It's open source.

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_PageThe Nullsoft installer is free, powerful and very, very good.The nullsoft scriptable install system is an open source solution that provides a very powerful and professional install system.We use MakeMSI here to construct Windows installers. Very steep learning curve, but it's guaranteed to work on any Windows system.

We've had problems with Nullsoft installers in the past, as silent, automated installs (the kind done all the time in managed environments) aren't supported by default.I search a lot but don't find nothing.I want make a C++ software to run a software with argument in C++Example : start putty -ssh user@server -pw passwordstart notepad -someargumentTo start a different software than your own program (with or without arguments) you can use system() from <cstdlib> header.

	I would advise checking with your email provider which you have setup in ACP -> System -> Email Settings. The email error log would simply indicate that there were no errors passing the email from our software to your provider. There could be errors after the provider has accepted it so checking with them would be your best bet.

	I have been using Invision for 6 months now, and have in general been very impressed with it.



	I use my site for customer support, and I also use subscriptions and plan to introduce product sales as well.



	As part of this update in the way I am running my business, I want to do a lot more with metrics, and integrations to other systems in order to do more with automation.



	Google now suggests that you swap all analytics over to GA4, so I did, and my initial sense of this is very positive. However, it does not give me any metrics on conversions/monetization through my site, and this kind of defeats its purpose.



	Can someone please advise or give some pointers on what I need to do to set this up? I can not find any relevant information anywhere.



	Thanks,



	Adam.



			
				


	Edited July 6 by Adam GoodrichHi Adam,



	We do not have anything which is specific to GA4. Have you taken a look in their documentation to see what is required for you to capture that data?Hi Marc,



	I am new to it and was kinda hoping there would be something here, as it seems a common requirement.



	I will go dig through their doco and see what I can find and report back with what I learn.



	Cheers,

	Adam.We have the facility to add standard google analytics code, however, how to ensure set things are working is really something in their documentation. Of course, once you get to those, if you have problems with adding them, please let us know and we can advise accordingly.I'd maybe recommend reading up on using Google tag manager @Adam Goodrich - we've found it's generally easier to implement these sorts of things in GA4 through that + I believe Invision have added some functionality which hooks into it in the latest release.Yes, there is the datalayer which you can use for this.

	I was unable to find a setting called data layer.



	This is what mine shows:


	So... I have worked out how to track and tag pages. Much easier than I thought.



	The next thing I want to do is to be able to detect commerce transactions and pass through what they are for, and how much they are for.



	My sense here is that this might be more difficult. Can you advise on page flow, and how I could extract this info from Invision?The reason you are not seeing that is it's a new feature in the latest 4.7 release of the platform, so I would advise you upgrade to that version first of allI saw a bunch of messages in the forum saying that the upgrade was causing site crashes. I am wondering if this might be a bit risky for us. We are in the middle of a sale.No problem. There of course is nothing forcing you to do so, however the functionality you are looking for there is in the latest release, so you would need to await that until you can use the datalayer functionThanks. Is there a way to revert the upgrade if it has an issue? We are using the cloud version of Invision.



			
				


	Edited July 7 by Adam GoodrichWe would generally fix it if there are any issues, rather than revertOk thanks for your help. I will take the plunge tomorrow 🙂No problem, Adam. Good luck with your upgradeHi there,



	

	We have upgraded and switched this on... and in debug mode I am not seeing anything coming through. I don't think we should need anything as you are injecting events and data.



	Is there something else I need to be doing ?



	Thanks,

	Adam.Sorry, please could you provide more information as to what you are checking there, and what exactly you switched on?Marc, he may be referring to the new info included with DataLayer. I’ve enabled this on my board, but the extra detail from datalayer push does not seem to be making it into GA. 


	I was going to try to figure this out more later and create my own issue for it, but I’ve been busy today. Lol1. If you're NOT seeing the link in the ACP menu, please take a look at the Admin permissions and verify that the account has the ""Manage general Data Layer settings, Events, and Properties"" permission.



	2. Once it's enabled, you should see such output at the top of your HTML source code: 



	3. ( I'm looking now at the push issue )I am seeing this at the top of my html... but still not seeing these events in GA.



	Oh... and what I meant about debug mode.. you can show events in debug mode in GA. You add a plugin to your browser.. and you see whats happening on that session via the debug mode.



	No debug events are showing, as I have not connected my browser.



	


	And here is snippet of dump from web site.



	


	 



			
				


	Edited July 8 by Adam GoodrichYou would need to refer to google on these unfortunately. As you can see, the datalayer there is actually showing. From the point of view of what the software does, its switched on and working.Hi Adam,



	To pass Data Layer Events from GTM to GA, you have to add the Universal Analytics Tag to your Tag Manager configuration (not the GA config).



	Currently, if you go to your Account/Container in Tag Manager, you should be able to add a new tag and see the Google Analytics options



	



	You'll also have to setup Event Triggers in Tag Manager so it knows to send the Community Events to GA.



	Glad to see we're getting some feedback on our Data Layer integration! Also stay tuned since integrating Commerce with the Data Layer is on the board for Phase II.



	To recap, our Data Layer integration is designed to push data to Tag Manager not Analytics, which are separate services.@Matt Finger ahhh haaa..  I think I'm starting to pick up what you're putting down.  



	In order to push from Tag manager to GA, do you need to define each individual event in the data layer (account_login, account_logout, content_view, search, etc) or once you create one will it pass through all of the various events that exist?That is correct, to my knowledge, creating one event for each is the only way.Hey @Matt...  you need to hire more Matt's like @Matt Finger.  He's doing an awesome job of holding up the reputation of the namesake!  



	I think I'm on a roll now as the debug view is now pulling in the info as expected in GA.  That was a LOT of typing though to define all of the tags, triggers, and variables!  (Not the fault of IPS...  though sometimes good things deserve it's cost in effort!)



	I'm going to give it a day or so to make its way out of the debug view so that I can start creating some interesting dashboards.  But this is EXACTLY what I've been hoping for when I asked for better GA integration.

	That's awesome!  That was literally going to be my next ask.Ok... so as promised I am sharing some learning back to the community.



	First - while I am not new to Google Analytics, I am new to Google Analytics 4 / GA4... and there is a lot of confusing information out there. GA4 is infinitely superior in my opinion, so it's worth the effort to dig into it so that I can get the metrics I want.



	I found that there was so much information out there on the internet, and a lot of it was out of date. So to bring me up to speed I went to Udemy, and subscribed to their Personal Learning subscription. The first month is free, and the rest is around $26/mth... an amazing deal since there is so much content there.



	I then started working my way through this course... it included free in that first month:



	Master Google Analytics 4 Reports and GTM Basics in 2022



	https://www.udemy.com/course/google-analytics-4-with-tag-manager/



	This gave me some background information and was extremely helpful.



	Then - I fixed the mistake that I had made... I had put my GA4 config on my site.



	What you actually need to do is create a GTM (Google Tag Manager) account, and create a special tag that routes events from GTM through to GA4.



	In all the reading I have done, it seems mixed as to whether you should also create a Universal Analytics account and also route those events. I chose not to as I want to craft the reports I get out of it and wanted to keep it 'clean'.



	The next big trick is to work out how to get Invision events from GTM through to GA4. That was nontrivial as well... and while I know what I wanted to do ... I was still a bit confused... and then I found this web page... excellent!

Track Events with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Tag Manager (analyticsmania.com)



	The Invision events are non-standard from GA4. As this is new, and GA4 is the future of analytics from google, then why not use their standard events - the whole thing would largely have just worked.



	So I routed the account_login event from invision through to the GA4 login event, and the account_register event from invision through to the GA4 sign_up event. Flick to debug view... and finally, the more detailed events I wanted to see are flowing through!



	It's been quite the learning journey... and my recommendation for the invision team is to create a video tutorial where you take people through this from end to end.



	Now... for the Invision team when will we be getting commerce events... which among other things is kind of the point of all of this?



	Please also, do not make subscriptions a second-class citizen. It's the primary way I want to run my site.



	Another thing with subscriptions that I get all the time is a request from my customers to get a special deal on them (as we want to encourage our existing customers to come over to our invision site). I am happy enough to do this, but I do not want this listed on my main page as then it would massively devalue our normal subscription. So an 'unlisted' version for subscriptions as well would be awesome... something where I can approve the subscription before it is switched on for the customer.



	Great work from the Invision team... once you work your way through all of this, it opens up many cool use cases for the platform!

GPL software library [closed],"IANAL, but, AFAIK, as long as you don't redistribute, in any form, the software you write that's a derivative work of a GPL one, having to put your own derivative work under GPL puts no obligation on you; IOW, a company that does its own in-house software based on your framework (as opposed to writing such software for third parties) should not care that it's GPL.  Of course, whether IT departments understand this is a different question;-).As someone who makes a couple software licensing decisions for a small company, I stay away from GPLed software.  Under the GPL, if you distribute derivative works, they must also under the GPL.

Maybe GPL is still the right case for you -- if the other businesses cannot or will not redistribute your product, GPL might be acceptable.  A commercial license option would be nice both to allow redistribution and to offer support -- management loves knowing software support is available.

But if your product is intended to be used as a library, I would still stay away from it due to the general legal uncertainty of the GPL.  There are so many other options that don't restrict (as much) what I can do with a piece of software; to name a few, LGPL, BSD, MIT, Apache, and of course public domain.

Like I said, GPL might be right for you, but that's usually the first thing I filter out when I'm evaluating open source software for use.Many companies shy away from GPL code due to its strong restrictions on linked or modified code, enforcing the rights of the original developers to require the availability of such code. Since it is very easy to expand the code covered by the freedom preserving terms of the GPL (just by linking and distributing, for example), many companies are wary.

If you are using GPL code to process data, that is a great use. The GPL license does nothing to the data that is sent through the code, just modifications to the code and/or products that link to the code.

Many companies now actually have policies about open source licensing. Most companies probably do not yet. Also, there are a lot of users/employees that either do not know about, or do not stand aforementioned policies, even if they do exist.

As a data processing framework, you would actually be ok using a GPL version if there is a front end UI and they do not need to link to your code. I believe SOAP APIs, Web interaction, data file loading and saving, ... will not incur any obligation under the GPL. That being said, if you do not require them to link to your library, the GPL license is not going to protect you nearly as much as you might like when you open source for trial purposes. If you are not having the community help with development, or extend your product, why not use a traditional trial license model?

Tread carefully and respectfully. (and sadly, by using a potentially offensive term in the first paragraph, I unintentionally missed on the respectfully part)

JacobI'm comfortable using LGPL libraries. But I will almost always shun GPL libraries, because there are too many gray areas with GPL libraries, and I neither understand, nor have the resources to get a definite answer on, to what extent the GPL license will ""spread"" into the application I write, and how to manage that ""spreading"".The GPL is not ""viral"" -- contrary to propaganda, it does not infect other software. While some companies balk at using a library available only under the GPL, there is no harm in using a library available under the GPL as long as a proprietary version is available as well.We don’t allow questions seeking recommendations for books, tools, software libraries, and more. You can edit the question so it can be answered with facts and citations. Closed 7 years ago. My company developed an enterprise data processing software framework. To drive adoption, we are thinking about putting the software under GPL so people can try it for free and maybe buy the commercial version of it. My question is that since GPL is viral, do companies actually find it permissable
to use GPL'ed software libraries so they can just use it at will. Do IT departments generally have open source licensing policies for dealing with GPL? What are the general attitute towards GPL'ed software libraries...

GPU with software rendering,"As far as I understand  it is GPUs job to render images and decide the values of the pixels to be displayed on the monitor. If i have a monitor connected to a GPU and i want to experiment with a software renderer, how is the work divided between GPU and the software renderer? I ask this because my monitor is still connected to the GPU, so the GPU must be transmitting the value of the pixels computed by the software renderer. But is it all that the GPU does? Is there a specific way of telling the GPU that ""only pass on these values to the monitor"". I am a newbie but i would like to know about the details.I believe you have some concepts confused. A GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) is just like the CPU. If you are building a software renderer, you will still interface with the graphics card to set the resolution and draw/bit blit pixels to the screen.

Here is the difference at a high level between hardware and software rendering. I am over simplifying this as there are vertex/pixel shaders etc. The GPU can also perform math for program just look at OpenCL.

Software

I have a triangle I would like to draw. Given the three points of it I need to figure out the slope of the edges and which x,y coordinates to fill on the screen. This would involve a loop going through each pixel of the triangle and drawing it to the screen.

Hardware

I have a triangle I would like to draw. Send 3 coordinates to the GPU and tell it to draw it. The GPU figures out which pixels to fill in, etc.

Please understand this is grossly oversimplifying the process.A GPU is more or less a hardware device that does certain types of vector math REALLY well compared to the CPU. A GPU is far more limited in terms of what it can do than a CPU, but it does what it does quickly.

Unless you are using DirectX or OpenGL, it's most likely that you're doing software rendering. If you are using DirectX or OpenGL, then you probably are using hardware rendering (though there are pure software implementations of both). 

Both hardware and software rendering both ultimately output to addressable memory known as the framebuffer (which holds the output bitmap to be rendered to the screen), the only difference is the hardware that sets that memory (e.g. the CPU or the GPU).

The physical memory addressed in the framebuffer  usually is part of the GPU (I'm not sure if it actually has to be on the GPU, input would be welcome).In older Windows and DirectX versions you can call Lock() method of DirectDraw surface to get temporary direct pointer to framebuffer, which you can access almost like any other bitmap in RAM. Same can be done in DOS through VESA drivers/other APIs, through GX driver on Pocket PC/Windows mobile. Not sure about other operating systems.

Framebuffer is an area in memory which is being streamed by display hardware directly to the output device. Usually it is on video card, but can be mapped into address space of your aplication and accessed directly like normal RAM. But, obviously, read/write speed is different. Read speed is typically very low, write speed is very good, but only if you just store consecutive, aligned 32/64/128 bit words. Usually it is better to render everything in offscreen buffer in RAM and then just memcpy its contents into framebuffer. Some graphics cards support hardware CPU-independent blitting from RAM surface to the framebuffer, but it can be buggy and/or slow.It depends on what level you're doing this ""software rendering"" at. Unless you're writing your own windowing system, the OS will still use the GPU to help it blit all its windows around.

If you want to write a software renderer, the simplest way to implement it would be to do your rendering to an in-memory bitmap, and then call into the OS to say ""oh hey, can you draw this image to the screen for me?"".",,,,,1,695,70.4,23.33,26.6,43.86,21.06,20.14,77.84,65.76,56.69,10.65,4.75,2.3,0,2.45,0,0,5.9,14.68,9.5,0.72,14.1,10.5,5.04,6.62,0.29,16.12,4.03,2.59,0.86,0.29,0.29,0.29,15.68,0.72,14.96,1.73,1.15,3.17,3.6,1.15,5.47,0.58,1.87,1.73,0.14,1.15,1.01,0.14,0,0,0,0,5.18,2.45,0.58,0.29,0,0,1.73,2.45,0,0,0,0,3.17,0.14,0,3.02,1.73,0,0.58,1.01,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.29,0.14,0,0.29,0,0,0,0.43,3.45,7.48,0.14,0.43,5.9,1.15,0,0,2.01,0.58,6.62,0.86,0.29,0.14,0,0.14,0,13.81,5.32,3.31,0.43,0,0.72,4.03,

Get installed software list using C#,"I try to get a list of installed application keys: I get only the Keys from: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall But I need also the Keys from: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall My program should be able to run on a 64Bit and on a 32Bit machine. edit: Ok I have tried Check if application is installed in registry and the solution from tHiNk_OuT_oF_bOx. But nothing has solved the Problem! The problem is i get exactly the same list for test and test2:Source from : http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/94c2f14d-c45e-4b55-9ba0-eb091bac1035/c-get-installed-programs

The solution is to search for 3 places in registry:


SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall inside CurrentUser
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall inside LocalMachine
SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall in LocalMachine


the code below suits you needs.

public static bool IsApplicationInstalled(string p_name)
{
    string displayName;
    RegistryKey key;

    // search in: CurrentUser
    key = Registry.CurrentUser.OpenSubKey(@""SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"");
    foreach (String keyName in key.GetSubKeyNames())
    {
        RegistryKey subkey = key.OpenSubKey(keyName);
        displayName = subkey.GetValue(""DisplayName"") as string;
        if (p_name.Equals(displayName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) == true)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }

    // search in: LocalMachine_32
    key = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(@""SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"");
    foreach (String keyName in key.GetSubKeyNames())
    {
        RegistryKey subkey = key.OpenSubKey(keyName);
        displayName = subkey.GetValue(""DisplayName"") as string;
        if (p_name.Equals(displayName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) == true)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }

    // search in: LocalMachine_64
    key = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(@""SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"");
    foreach (String keyName in key.GetSubKeyNames())
    {
        RegistryKey subkey = key.OpenSubKey(keyName);
        displayName = subkey.GetValue(""DisplayName"") as string;
        if (p_name.Equals(displayName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) == true)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }

    // NOT FOUND
    return false;
}It seems you now have to use OpenBaseKey, there is the code im using:

List<string> gInstalledSoftware
        void GetInstalledSoftwareList()
        {
            string displayName;

            using (RegistryKey key = Registry.CurrentUser.OpenSubKey(@""SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"", false))
            {                
                foreach (String keyName in key.GetSubKeyNames())
                {
                    RegistryKey subkey = key.OpenSubKey(keyName);
                    displayName = subkey.GetValue(""DisplayName"") as string;
                    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(displayName))
                        continue;

                    gInstalledSoftware.Add(displayName.ToLower());
                }
            }

            //using (RegistryKey key = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(@""SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"", false))
            using (var localMachine = RegistryKey.OpenBaseKey(RegistryHive.LocalMachine, RegistryView.Registry64))
            {
                var key = localMachine.OpenSubKey(@""SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"", false);
                foreach (String keyName in key.GetSubKeyNames())
                {
                    RegistryKey subkey = key.OpenSubKey(keyName);
                    displayName = subkey.GetValue(""DisplayName"") as string;
                    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(displayName))
                        continue;

                    gInstalledSoftware.Add(displayName.ToLower());
                }
            }

            using (var localMachine = RegistryKey.OpenBaseKey(RegistryHive.LocalMachine, RegistryView.Registry32))
            {
                var key = localMachine.OpenSubKey(@""SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"", false);
                foreach (String keyName in key.GetSubKeyNames())
                {
                    RegistryKey subkey = key.OpenSubKey(keyName);
                    displayName = subkey.GetValue(""DisplayName"") as string;
                    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(displayName))
                        continue;

                    gInstalledSoftware.Add(displayName.ToLower());
                }
            }

            using (RegistryKey key = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(@""SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"",false))
            {
                foreach (String keyName in key.GetSubKeyNames())
                {
                    RegistryKey subkey = key.OpenSubKey(keyName);
                    displayName = subkey.GetValue(""DisplayName"") as string;
                    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(displayName))
                        continue;

                    gInstalledSoftware.Add(displayName.ToLower());
                }
            }             
        }All answers fail to retrieve every installed application on Windows 10. The codes above only display most used installed apps NOT all installed apps. So I found this solution:

string appPATH = @""SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"";
            using (RegistryKey rk = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(appPATH))
            {
                foreach (string skName in rk.GetSubKeyNames())
                {
                    using (RegistryKey sk = rk.OpenSubKey(skName))
                    {
                        try
                        {

                            //Get App Name
                            var displayName = sk.GetValue(""DisplayName"");
                            //Get App Size
                            var size = sk.GetValue(""EstimatedSize"");

                            string item;
                            if (displayName != null)
                            {
                                if (size != null)
                                    item = displayName.ToString();
                                else
                                {
                                    item = displayName.ToString();
                                    if (item.Contains(""""))
                                    MessageBox.Show(displayName.ToString());

                                }

                            }
                        }
                        catch (Exception ex)
                        { }
                    }
                }

            }I used this code, its a bit more abstract and it checks for 32/64 bit OS. It also uses C#V8 features for simplicity.

public static bool CheckAppInstallation(string programName)
{
    bool result = false;

    string uninstallKey2 = @""SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"";

    result |= CheckInAddress(uninstallKey1, RegistryHive.CurrentUser, programName);
    result |= CheckInAddress(uninstallKey2, RegistryHive.LocalMachine, programName);
    return result;

    static bool CheckInAddress(string address, RegistryHive hive, string programName)
    {
        var view = Environment.Is64BitOperatingSystem ? RegistryView.Registry64 : RegistryView.Registry32;
        using var localKey = RegistryKey.OpenBaseKey(hive, view).OpenSubKey(address);
        foreach (var subKey in localKey.GetSubKeyNames().Select(keyName => localKey.OpenSubKey(keyName)))
            if (subKey.GetValue(""DisplayName"") is string displayName && displayName.Contains(programName))
                return true;
        return false;
    }

Git is not working after macOS Update (xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library...,"I updated to macOS Mojave (this happens on Catalina update too, and seems to potentially occur on every major update thereafter) This morning I navigated to my work's codebase in the Command Line on my MacBook pro, typed in ""git status"" in the repository and received the error: xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun How do I fix git, and command line tools?The problem is that Xcode Command-line Tools needs to be updated.
Solution #1
Go back to your terminal and enter:
xcode-select --install

You'll then receive the following output:
xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools

You will then be prompted in a window to update Xcode Command Line tools. (which may take a while)
Open a new terminal window and your development tools should be returned.
Addition: With any major or semi-major update you'll need to update the command line tools in order to get them functioning properly again. Check Xcode with any update. This goes beyond Mojave...
After that restart your terminal
Alternatively, IF that fails, and it very well might.... you'll get a pop-up box saying ""Software not found on server"", see below!
Solution #2
and you hit xcode-select --install and it doesn't find the software, log into Apple Developer, and install it via webpage.
Log in or sign up here:
https://developer.apple.com/download/more/
Look for: ""Command Line Tools for Xcode 12.x"" in the list of downloads
Then click the dmg and download.I got some errors that the software was unavailable from the update server when trying 

xcode-select --install


What fixed it for me was going here https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ and downloading Command Line Tools (macOS 10.14) for Xcode 10 and then installing it manually.

After that, the errors should be gone when you open up a new terminal.For me xcode-select --reset was the solution on Mojave.In addition to dustbuster's answer I needed to set path to the Xcode folder with this command:

sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineToolsupdated from Mojave to Big Sur and got the same error :
the command
xcode-select --install

worked like a charmFor me what worked is the following:

sudo xcode-select --reset


Then like in @High6's answer:

sudo xcodebuild -license


This will reveal a license which I assume is some Xcode license. Scroll to the bottom using space (or the mouse) then tap agree. 

This is what worked for me on MacOS Mojave v 10.14.After upgrade to Mac Catalina I faced the same issue, I had to run couple of commands to get this fixed. 

First started with: 

xcode-select --install 

It didn't fix the problem, had to run the following in sudo 

sudo xcode-select --reset 

Then, finally got fixed after I switched and set the path explicitly for active developer directory: 

sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools

Note: In case you have Xcode installed, you may need to specify Xcode directory in this case, it should be something like this

xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.appI've used xcode-select --install given in the accepted answer in previous major releases.

I've just upgraded to OS X 10.15 Catalina and run the Software Update tool from preferences again after the OS upgrade completed. The Xcode utilities update was available there, which also sorted the issue using git which had just output 
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)in my case it wasn't checked in xcode 
After installation process , 

you can do that as following :
xcode -> Preferences and tap Locations then select  , as the followng  imageIf you use xcode then install it (~12GB)
xcode-select --install

Otherwise install latest command line tools (~500MB)Mac OS : Big Sur
First Priority
sudo xcode-select --reset

sudo xcodebuild -license

Second Priority
xcode-select --installI figured out the Xcode Command Line Tools part from the error message, but after running Xcode and getting the prompt to install the additional tools it did claim to install them, but still I got the same error after opening a new terminal.

So I did the xcode-select --install manually and after that it worked for me.Following worked on M1
ProductName:    macOS
ProductVersion: 11.2.1
BuildVersion:   20D74

% xcode-select --install

Agree the Terms and Conditions prompt, it will return following message on success.
% xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer toolsIf you have Xcode downloaded manually (i.e. not from the App Store) or don't have Xcode at all:


sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
Go to https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ to download Command Line Tools (macOS 10.14) for Xcode 10
Setup Command Line Tools 


If you have Xcode installed from the App Store:


xcode-select --installOpen Terminal:

install XCode developer tools and fix the problem.

$ xcode-select --install


Reset the path to Xcode if you have several versions:

$ xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app
$ xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineToolsRun this command:

xcode-select --install

Hit return for a progress indicator on the Command Line Tools download.

After installation of the Command Line Tools has been completed, your Mac should be rebooted. If you’re getting “xcrun error invalid active developer path” while working in Terminal, refresh the application or relaunch it.


Even after following the above-mentioned steps, if you see the error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools). The next step would be to try and install Command Line Tools using a DMG file that can be downloaded directly from the Apple website.
Again, if you are using Homebrew, you need to update it. You don’t need to uninstall and again install Homebrew on Mac.
NOTE: If you are using Homebrew, try updating it after re-installing Command Line tools.
Credits: Git not working after macOS UpdateFor me, I didn't have xcode installed (on Mojave OS). I went to the App Store on my mac and downloaded it, then went back to terminal and typed git and hit enter, then it worked.This works for me 

sudo xcode-select --reset 
sudo xcodebuild -license


X-code must be installed.I found that my version of Xcode was too outdated and installing command-line-tools wasn't helping. Here's what I did:


I completely uninstalled the outdated XCode
I reinstalled the most recent XCode from the app store
That was all. Git was restored.I observed in the Catalina privacy setting if Xcode not added in Full access disk I will get the same error, Xcode does not run scripts. Add your Xcode the same as in the attached image. After that clean build and run. Hope so it will work.For those using Catalina and Xcode-beta:

sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/DeveloperFor me It happened after Mac OS update to Mojave and git was not functioning in Intellij 

Solution:-
Go to Settings, then File | Settings | Version Control | Git and edit Path to Git executable field which is /usr/local/bin/gitI had the same issue and couldn't use SVN after the update,

Just in case if doing  xcode-select --install didn't fix the issue,

You might see,


  svn: error: The subversion command line tools are no longer provided by Xcode.


Refer : https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_catalina_10_15_release_notes

Try installing the svn by brew

brew install svn


This should get you going.I updated my macOS yesterday，from macOS Mojave（10.14.6）to macOS Catalina（10.15.7），I was executing ""git"" command in my project. I get same errors。
run：
xcode-select --installAfter Updating macOS to Monterey (12.3) from BigSur getting such issue
only worked-

xcode-select --install

Done!MacOS :Monterey

Year: 2022
Solution: Upgrade to 12.2.1 or later
I upgraded to Monetery 12.2 as my Macbook pro got replaced. Ran into same issue as OP:

Git is not working after macOS Update (Xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)

One would think that by this time Apple would have added xCode & developer tools into OS main build. Turned out they did. I had to upgrade to 12.2.1, which included ""command line tools for xCode"".

I still need to do step upgrade to 12.4 , but I believe we finally have these tools as part of OS build.
Here's screen-shot while attempting to upgrade from 12.2.1 to 12.3.1 (I forgot to take one while upgrading from 12.2 to 12.2.1, but I am pretty sure it had same Addons)If you created a new Applications folder in an external drive and installed Xcode there:
sudo xcode-select --switch /Volumes/MyExternalStorageName/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/DeveloperEdge case, but still worth writing down: when migrating from and older Mac with Migration Assistant, you may have selected the option to transfer all your applications from your older Mac. Applications, like Xcode needs to be updated if it was transferred and preserved OR delete from your other user's Applications folder. This is because Xcode has not been set up properly after the first start with the new OS version.None of the above answers worked for me. I had a couple of issues. First, I installed the latest version of Xcode, 14.0 beta. That ended up not working because it was a version that is not compatible with Monterey. And my computer is too old to install Ventura beta. So I had to go and find out which version of Xcode actually did work. And that ended up being 13.4.1. So I installed that. I had taken all the right steps beforehand to delete the old version, and then placed the new one, as always, into my Applications folder. But for whatever reason, it did not end up there. When I checked to see if my install was successful, errors were thrown in Terminal. I had also previously updated CLT, which included the correct version. However, Terminal returned that I needed to install CLT. And when I tried, it told me that it was already installed, but I should change the path of my Xcode or install CLT (which obviously was not a real option). I found the solution in this article entitled Xcode-select active developer directory error. And I ran the following command in Terminal which fixed my path:
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

Hope this helps anyone else who encounters the same issue when trying to update Xcode on macOS Monterey and also can't update to macOS Ventura.I updated to macOS Mojave (this happens on Catalina update too, and seems to potentially occur on every major update thereafter)

This morning I navigated to my work's codebase in the Command Line on my MacBook pro, typed in ""git status"" in the repository and received the error:

xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun

How do I fix git, and command line tools?The problem is that Xcode Command-line Tools needs to be updated.
Solution #1
Go back to your terminal and enter:
xcode-select --install

You'll then receive the following output:
xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools

You will then be prompted in a window to update Xcode Command Line tools. (which may take a while)
Open a new terminal window and your development tools should be returned.
Addition: With any major or semi-major update you'll need to update the command line tools in order to get them functioning properly again. Check Xcode with any update. This goes beyond Mojave...
After that restart your terminal
Alternatively, IF that fails, and it very well might.... you'll get a pop-up box saying ""Software not found on server"", see below!
Solution #2
and you hit xcode-select --install and it doesn't find the software, log into Apple Developer, and install it via webpage.
Log in or sign up here:
https://developer.apple.com/download/more/
Look for: ""Command Line Tools for Xcode 12.x"" in the list of downloads
Then click the dmg and download.I got some errors that the software was unavailable from the update server when trying 

xcode-select --install


What fixed it for me was going here https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ and downloading Command Line Tools (macOS 10.14) for Xcode 10 and then installing it manually.

After that, the errors should be gone when you open up a new terminal.For me xcode-select --reset was the solution on Mojave.In addition to dustbuster's answer I needed to set path to the Xcode folder with this command:

sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineToolsupdated from Mojave to Big Sur and got the same error :
the command
xcode-select --install

worked like a charmFor me what worked is the following:

sudo xcode-select --reset


Then like in @High6's answer:

sudo xcodebuild -license


This will reveal a license which I assume is some Xcode license. Scroll to the bottom using space (or the mouse) then tap agree. 

This is what worked for me on MacOS Mojave v 10.14.After upgrade to Mac Catalina I faced the same issue, I had to run couple of commands to get this fixed. 

First started with: 

xcode-select --install 

It didn't fix the problem, had to run the following in sudo 

sudo xcode-select --reset 

Then, finally got fixed after I switched and set the path explicitly for active developer directory: 

sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools

Note: In case you have Xcode installed, you may need to specify Xcode directory in this case, it should be something like this

xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.appI've used xcode-select --install given in the accepted answer in previous major releases.

I've just upgraded to OS X 10.15 Catalina and run the Software Update tool from preferences again after the OS upgrade completed. The Xcode utilities update was available there, which also sorted the issue using git which had just output 
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)in my case it wasn't checked in xcode 
After installation process , 

you can do that as following :
xcode -> Preferences and tap Locations then select  , as the followng  imageIf you use xcode then install it (~12GB)
xcode-select --install

Otherwise install latest command line tools (~500MB)Mac OS : Big Sur
First Priority
sudo xcode-select --reset

sudo xcodebuild -license

Second Priority
xcode-select --installI figured out the Xcode Command Line Tools part from the error message, but after running Xcode and getting the prompt to install the additional tools it did claim to install them, but still I got the same error after opening a new terminal.

So I did the xcode-select --install manually and after that it worked for me.Following worked on M1
ProductName:    macOS
ProductVersion: 11.2.1
BuildVersion:   20D74

% xcode-select --install

Agree the Terms and Conditions prompt, it will return following message on success.
% xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer toolsIf you have Xcode downloaded manually (i.e. not from the App Store) or don't have Xcode at all:


sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
Go to https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ to download Command Line Tools (macOS 10.14) for Xcode 10
Setup Command Line Tools 


If you have Xcode installed from the App Store:


xcode-select --installOpen Terminal:

install XCode developer tools and fix the problem.

$ xcode-select --install


Reset the path to Xcode if you have several versions:

$ xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app
$ xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineToolsRun this command:

xcode-select --install

Hit return for a progress indicator on the Command Line Tools download.

After installation of the Command Line Tools has been completed, your Mac should be rebooted. If you’re getting “xcrun error invalid active developer path” while working in Terminal, refresh the application or relaunch it.


Even after following the above-mentioned steps, if you see the error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools). The next step would be to try and install Command Line Tools using a DMG file that can be downloaded directly from the Apple website.
Again, if you are using Homebrew, you need to update it. You don’t need to uninstall and again install Homebrew on Mac.
NOTE: If you are using Homebrew, try updating it after re-installing Command Line tools.
Credits: Git not working after macOS UpdateFor me, I didn't have xcode installed (on Mojave OS). I went to the App Store on my mac and downloaded it, then went back to terminal and typed git and hit enter, then it worked.This works for me 

sudo xcode-select --reset 
sudo xcodebuild -license


X-code must be installed.I found that my version of Xcode was too outdated and installing command-line-tools wasn't helping. Here's what I did:


I completely uninstalled the outdated XCode
I reinstalled the most recent XCode from the app store
That was all. Git was restored.I observed in the Catalina privacy setting if Xcode not added in Full access disk I will get the same error, Xcode does not run scripts. Add your Xcode the same as in the attached image. After that clean build and run. Hope so it will work.For those using Catalina and Xcode-beta:

sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/DeveloperFor me It happened after Mac OS update to Mojave and git was not functioning in Intellij 

Solution:-
Go to Settings, then File | Settings | Version Control | Git and edit Path to Git executable field which is /usr/local/bin/gitI had the same issue and couldn't use SVN after the update,

Just in case if doing  xcode-select --install didn't fix the issue,

You might see,


  svn: error: The subversion command line tools are no longer provided by Xcode.


Refer : https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_catalina_10_15_release_notes

Try installing the svn by brew

brew install svn


This should get you going.I updated my macOS yesterday，from macOS Mojave（10.14.6）to macOS Catalina（10.15.7），I was executing ""git"" command in my project. I get same errors。
run：
xcode-select --installAfter Updating macOS to Monterey (12.3) from BigSur getting such issue
only worked-

xcode-select --install

Done!MacOS :Monterey

Year: 2022
Solution: Upgrade to 12.2.1 or later
I upgraded to Monetery 12.2 as my Macbook pro got replaced. Ran into same issue as OP:

Git is not working after macOS Update (Xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)

One would think that by this time Apple would have added xCode & developer tools into OS main build. Turned out they did. I had to upgrade to 12.2.1, which included ""command line tools for xCode"".

I still need to do step upgrade to 12.4 , but I believe we finally have these tools as part of OS build.
Here's screen-shot while attempting to upgrade from 12.2.1 to 12.3.1 (I forgot to take one while upgrading from 12.2 to 12.2.1, but I am pretty sure it had same Addons)If you created a new Applications folder in an external drive and installed Xcode there:
sudo xcode-select --switch /Volumes/MyExternalStorageName/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/DeveloperEdge case, but still worth writing down: when migrating from and older Mac with Migration Assistant, you may have selected the option to transfer all your applications from your older Mac. Applications, like Xcode needs to be updated if it was transferred and preserved OR delete from your other user's Applications folder. This is because Xcode has not been set up properly after the first start with the new OS version.None of the above answers worked for me. I had a couple of issues. First, I installed the latest version of Xcode, 14.0 beta. That ended up not working because it was a version that is not compatible with Monterey. And my computer is too old to install Ventura beta.

Git pull after forced update,"I just squashed some commits with git rebase and did a git push --force (which is evil, I know). Now the other software engineers have a different history and when they do a git pull, Git will merge. Is there a way to fix this, except doing a rm my-repo; git clone git@example.org:my-repo.git? I need something like the opposite of git push --force, but git pull --force did not give the intended results.To receive the new commits
git fetch

Reset
You can reset the commit for a local branch using git reset.
To change the commit of a local branch:
git reset origin/main --hard

Be careful though, as the documentation puts it:

Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are discarded.

If you want to actually keep whatever changes you've got locally - do a --soft reset instead. Which will update the commit history for the branch, but not change any files in the working directory (and you can then commit them).
Rebase
You can replay your local commits on top of any other commit/branch using git rebase:
git rebase -i origin/main

This will invoke rebase in interactive mode where you can choose how to apply each individual commit that isn't in the history you are rebasing on top of.
If the commits you removed (with git push -f) have already been pulled into the local history, they will be listed as commits that will be reapplied - they would need to be deleted as part of the rebase or they will simply be re-included into the history for the branch - and reappear in the remote history on the next push.
Use the help git command --help for more details and examples on any of the above (or other) commands.Pull with rebase
A regular pull is fetch + merge, but what you want is fetch + rebase.  This is an option with the pull command:
git pull --rebase

In your particular case, commits have been removed which you don't want to be reapplied.  This has to be done manually.  Therefore, the rebase needs to be interactive so these commits can be skipped:
git pull --rebase=interactive

or as of Git 2.26 can be shortened to:
git pull --rebase=iThis won't fix branches that already have the code you don't want in them (see below for how to do that), but if they had pulled some-branch and now want it to be clean (and not ""ahead"" of origin/some-branch) then you simply:

git checkout some-branch   # where some-branch can be replaced by any other branch
git branch base-branch -D  # where base-branch is the one with the squashed commits
git checkout -b base-branch origin/base-branch  # recreating branch with correct commits


Note: You can combine these all by putting && between them

Note2: Florian mentioned this in a comment, but who reads comments when looking for answers?

Note3: If you have contaminated branches, you can create new ones based off the new ""dumb branch"" and just cherry-pick commits over.

Ex:

git checkout feature-old  # some branch with the extra commits
git log                   # gives commits (write down the id of the ones you want)
git checkout base-branch  # after you have already cleaned your local copy of it as above
git checkout -b feature-new # make a new branch for your feature
git cherry-pick asdfasd   # where asdfasd is one of the commit ids you want
# repeat previous step for each commit id
git branch feature-old -D # delete the old branch


Now feature-new is your branch without the extra (possibly bad) commits!To fetch changes from the remote repository into your local repo:
git fetch

Rename the tracking branch:
git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-name>

Create a new local branch tracking the remote branch:

Good Programming Software [closed],"What would you recommend as a GUI software to code in php, c, c++ software. Doesnt matter free or paid.

I, personally, just roll my own with vim and some scripts.This is one of those religious questions capable of endless arguument.  Some of the most popular are


EMACS
Vi/Vim
TextMate

I've also seen people speak well of SubEthaEdit, BBEdit, Smultron, and TextWrangler (that's weighted toward Mac apps since that's what I use normally.)For a light-weight but still feature rich solution, I think Geany strikes a fantastic balance.  I do all my programming (across several languages) in it.A lot of people like to have all their programming utilities in one. This is called an ""Integrated Development Environment"" or IDE. NetBeans and Eclipse are both IDEs (and Emacs can be an IDE if you use its advanced features.) The ""standard"" IDE for Windows development is Microsoft Visual Studio, although I personally can't stand using it.

But there's something to be said for keeping the functionality separate, and I'd suggest trying it that way. You end up with a cleaner and more ""purpose-built"" user interface for each separate task. Good programming editors for Windows include Notepad++ and Geany, neither of which is a full-on IDE.By GUI you mean: IDE? (ie 'Integrated Development Environment')

Good datamodelling software,"I was wondering if anybody had recommendations for some good datamodelling software?  I've used an older version of Sybase Powerdesigner and found it a bit clunky - was hoping to get something a little easier to use...I used Data Architect (part of PowerDesigner) about ten years ago, and I would hardly describe it as clunky.  It had one of the smoothest ways I have ever seen for handling the difference between a conceptual data model and a physical data model.  

The CDMs in DA were not tied to any particular DBMS.  This made it possible to model the data once at the CDM level, then turn around and build databases in Oracle, SQL server, DB2 and what have you.  

DA also had truly outstanding capabilities for the time for reverse engineering an existing database and reconstructing a CDM from it.  Sometimes you had to correct the results of reverse engineering but this was not hard to do.

DA saved me a mountain of tedious, boring, and error prone work.  If there are better tools out there today,  I hope they haven't lost what made DA good.wwwsqldesigner is web-based, and fairly rudimentary, but perfect for simple designs.

DBDesigner by fabForce is also a good tool, though it is intended for MySQL. But if your SQL is fairly standard, or if you just need it for a visual reference (i.e. you're not exporting SQL from the model) then it should be fine.I like the Toad Data Modeller

	This is not IPS original. It is modified. You do not allow to index your website for any bot. Disallow applies in your case for User-agents lines above, like this:

	I recommend using robots.txt generated by IPS. It will exclude tons of duplicate URLs or those with no or poor content. If you block anything, your site will not be indexed. If you allow everything, this is also bad for SEO, as Google has to crawl many URLs that have no benefit for you.

Group Promotion or Subscription for X Amount of Time Manually?,"Hey All,



	Trying to see what the correct workflow for promoting someone to a group is manually. I assume it has to be done via subscriptions in Commerce?



	 



	



	What is our use case?



	We accept currency via Patreon instead of our current forum currently (still working on our live conversion) and we manually give people an upgrade and an expiration date when a Patreon pledge comes in every month. Trying to replicate the same thing in IPB.



	It seems if I do ""Free Forever"", I can then go in manually and add an expiration date. I do not want the board to currently invoice or pester the member about anything, we are just trying to handle the automation of groups. After we finish our live conversion in the future, we will see about doing our own Patreon plugin or see if an existing one on the marketplace is updated or move to commerce, but currently manual is the way to go as we've already been doing it that way for years and we don't want to delay any more then we have to.If an expiration is set in the system, it will try to invoice the client when the purchase expires. I'm afraid, there is no way around this as this is how Commerce is designed to function.



	""Free Forever"" will just provide them with a subscription with no expiration. However, you setting the expiration manually will still cause an invoice to be issued upon the renewal period.On 8/13/2022 at 8:29 AM,   Jim M said:

	Thanks Marc, I figured it was something like this. Because we have limited membership to these groups, in our case students, I have started a database with a field for members and I am populating this so the moderators will have this list, in their category, with live links on the listing too, very helpful for us. It also gives a field for keeping notes, like evaluations of student progress too.



	I looked at clubs which does list the members and could set it up that way too, as I'm registering the students I can have things set up for them before I notify them of their membership, but I think the database is better for us.



	We have 15 classes or groups of students in 4 schools with 5 groups of moderators and so far your system and its layers of permissions is handling the complexity and its working, each class only sees its own version of the site, forums, galleries, calenders, yet there is course material that is common to them too, in databases with categories.

	Its not that I want to show the members who is in charge, I want to show the moderators who they are in charge of. The staff directory doesn't work in this case as there are no categories for it, I have tried it.


	We have 5 moderators in charge of different school groups and I don't want them to see each others school students, it is unnecessary for them and would be confusing. We the admins can see all that, and I look after the students to make sure they can access the content they are supposed to, and the moderators are the teachers who look after their classes or groups.



	I think the database is the way for us, as I register the students I enter them into the database under their categories and their moderators have permissions to access their categories.


	I was just hoping I could find an automatic way to do this and show a listing of the members of our 15 groups to their moderators using permissions so they would only see their groups. and the member plug-in block nearly does it, but the filters it has prevent it from working the way we want it. Maybe it is possible for a developer to tweak the filters, like Vala Advanced Widget Setting 1.2.2 which is also very useful.

Gujarati OCR software [closed],"Want to improve this question?

Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 8 years ago. How would one go about creating an ocr software for indic languages? How can one analyze the character's?
How to manipulate them into font data? I believe that I would need to use some form of tracing the line patterns and analyzing those patterns to a font character.OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is not an ordinary programming task. Indeed it not just about your programming skills and demands a good understanding of a chunk of scientific issues. 
Here I draw a general picture of the steps required to accomplish such a task and mention the skills required, so you can follow them if you insisted yet;  


Preprocessing: An OCR program almost always performs a pre-processing on the image to improve it's quality as an input to its Recognition part. (Skill:Image Processing)
Character Recognition: After applying the required changes to the input image (like removing some parts, scaling, applying some filters, ...) the program should recognize the character using a tool from the vast number of tools that exist (like Neural Networks, SVM, KNN ...).(Skill: Machine Learning-at least enough knowledge about one of the pre-mentioned tools)
Postprocessing: The accuracy of the output from the previous step can further improve most of the time specially if you inject a domain knowledge into the problem, like forcing the output to an existing lexicon. (skill: ML again- KNN, CBR, ...)



I hope this general explanation guides you well. And believe that I tried to keep it as simple as possible.Gujarati script could be tricky for many existing OCR libraries. A few questions:


Do you want to read machine-printed text, or handwriting? These are two separate problem domains.
Do you intend to develop/apply the OCR algorithm to a specific set of images/texts? If so, could you post some sample images?
What is your end goal? Do you want to scan handwritten texts for machine processing, or read text for industrial applications, or scan forms?
What read rate (accuracy) would be acceptable?


I'd suggest that textbooks are still a better starting point than reading a smattering of posts, articles, and papers online. There are two books I recommend for anyone interested in OCR:

Reading in the Brain by Stanislas Dehaene

Character Recognition Systems by Cheriet et al.

The Dehaene book is quite readable, and when reading it you will develop certain notions about how OCR might be developed for your particular application. I think it's typically best, no matter your level of experience, to try to solve a problem with whatever skills you have before you spend too much time reading the work of others. Spend a few days or a few weeks writing a bit of code or at least writing down ideas. 

The Cheriet book gives a relatively current overview of work in the field. Even if the math isn't familiar to you, you'll get some idea of what research has been done.

Try first to get a broad overview of what has been done in the field, and what techniques have been tested for scripts similar to Gujarati. Stroke extraction techniques tested for Japanese, Chinese, and related scripts would likely be relevant to Gujarati. To my knowledge the number of existing OCR solutions for scripts such as Gujarati is relatively limited. However, some neural network-based methods could be used to train software on Gujarati characters (or any arbitrary symbols) and then recognize them, assuming the characters to be read are machine printed.

See if you can find a set of sample images for Gujarati. For a number of languages there are standard image sets or at least common image sets used to test the accuracy of OCR algorithms. If possible, get the original, raw, color or 8-bit grayscale images rather than images that have already been binarized to black and white (0 and 1).



As a start, I'd recommend finding at least one software package that at least partly solves your problem. Some OCR algorithms recognize outlines, others use neural networks to recognize grayscale patterns, and so on. Once you find a software package that has an algorithm that is somewhat successful with your image samples, you can identify what type of algorithm is used and proceed from there.

Tesseract is mentioned frequently. Free's a good price, so you might want to give it a try.
https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/

It's been a few years since I looked at the following, but one of these may have a user-trainable font that you could try on machine-printed Gujarati:


FineReader by ABBYY.
OmniPage by Nuance.


Companies in industrial image processing (a.k.a. ""machine vision"") offer software packages that implement a variety of OCR algorithms. Although these software packages are typically designed to read a few lines of text on silicon wafers, product packaging, or the like, they may be useful to you because (a) the simple user interfaces may help you test ideas quickly, (b) the packages include many additional image processing tools, (c) there are few limitations on the characters, symbols, or image features you can train, and (d) you may be able to download trial versions that have fully functional OCR tools.

And you shouldn't have, HKCU is actually pointer to -> HKUS\UserSid

Now HKCU\Software\Classes is actually pointer to -> HKUS\UserSid\Software\Classes, and this one is actually pointer to HKUS\UserSid_Classes

Now here comes WOW redirection, and for example HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID becomes:

So in short, HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wow6432Node\Classes is most-likely a leftover after some misbehaving application (that was probably trying to figure out redirection by itself...)

In fact, I think that HKCU\Software\Wow6432Node should not exist - it's not listed on that article I linked above and on my system I have only HKCU\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components with a few subkeys, which suggests to me they're in the wrong place.I'm not sure, but I can tell you that my Windows 7 x64 machine only has the latter one.  I do have HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wow6432Node\, but Classes doesn't exist inside that for me.The reason for the ""Wow6432Node"" reg key and the other key, is that on modern 64 bit machines we still run alot of 32-bit apps. Microsoft knowing this, has allsorts of mirroing, and spoofing schemes within the registry to sort it all out. Usually this works to your advantage. 

Say you are trying to register som component to the registry in code. All you need to do is try to put your entries into the key(reg path) you think you want. The registry will take that request and deal with it (propably putting it into the Wow6432Node sub-directory).

In other words, 99% of the time ignor 'Wow6432Node'. Especially if you are registering things to the registry from code. If you manually include 'Wow6432Node' in your path, then your app will only work right on 64-bit machines - which are the only ones who use that reg path.) 

SUMMARY: Its where windows puts your 32-bit stuff on a 64-bit machine!!!!!HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Classes is linked to 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Wow6432Node

You can read this at the bottom of this article.I have no explanation for the ""Classes"" subkey and I don't see it on my own machines but the HKCU...Wow6432Node subkey is confusing itself since it is not associated with registry redirection and is not listed in the ""Registry Keys Affected by WOW64"" MSDN doc.  I'm wondering if the OP was referring to a theoretical ""Classes"" child subkey of ""Wow6432Node"".

""Active Setup"" is a reason that HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wow6432Node may exist.  Application installers sometimes require per-user modifications to run when the user next logs in.  

At login, to detect such modifications needed for 32-bit applications on 64-bit Windows, Windows compares 
[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components{GUID}] 
to 
[HKCU\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components{GUID}].

If the HKLM GUID subkey is not also found in the HKCU analogous location, Windows performs the installation operations and copies the information to 
[HKCU\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components] (so that the installation operations are not repeated).

So, if [HKCU\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components] is present, then the ""Wow6432Node"" portion of the HKCU... subkey ID is likely just text that matches a portion of the HKLM... subkey.",,,,,1,704,48.96,19.76,40.26,18.55,24.28,28.41,78.84,58.1,47.44,12.07,6.25,2.98,0.43,2.27,0,0.43,5.82,12.36,5.54,6.68,10.8,8.81,4.55,5.26,2.56,13.78,5.54,2.13,1.7,0.43,0.99,0.43,13.21,0.99,12.22,2.41,0.85,1.85,3.13,0.57,4.55,0,0.99,0.28,0.43,0.57,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,5.68,2.27,0,0.14,0.14,0.28,1.7,3.41,0,0,0,0,4.55,0,0,4.55,5.54,0.14,0.85,4.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0.28,0,0.14,3.84,5.97,0.14,0.99,4.83,0.28,0,0,2.84,1.14,8.24,0.43,0.57,0.28,0,0,0.28,34.94,5.97,3.69,0.43,0.71,2.98,21.16,

Half database tables are MyISAM and half are InnoDB,"Hi. I've been concerned for a while about the message I get in my dashboard regarding database tables, ""It is strongly encouraged to ensure all of your database tables are using the InnoDB storage engine, and that your hosting provider has configured MySQL for InnoDB use. ""



	A couple of times I've had a look into it, and even contacted support on my hosted service but I've not made much progress. I just clicked on the SQL toolbox link in my dashboard and it shows that roughly half of my tables are already in InnoDB and half are MyISAM. Is this normal? I'm confused as to how that is.



	So I presume I'm okay to assume that my server is already set up to use InnoDB. How do I convert the rest please?



	Many thanks



	 



			
				


	Edited February 26 by WasherhelpYou say your host - Are you on a cpanel server ?



	If you are then phpmyadmin is capable of altering the tables from MyIASM to InnoDBI would advise taking a backup of your database prior to making any changes. If you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable changing your database to InnoDB, it is advised to contact your hosting provider or hire a server administrator to assist you. While the process is not expert-level difficulty, if something goes wrong, it's good to have support.@Washerhelp



	The following will be of help and remember to take a database backup beforehand as Jim suggested.I'd just like to report back, for the benefit of anyone else with this issue, that I managed to convert all my databases to InnoDB without difficulty. I'm pretty sure I did it the hard way – I'd be surprised if there wasn't an easier way, but here's what I did -



	I went to PhpMyAdmin, clicked on the database



	Clicked SQL tab and pasted in the following - ALTER TABLE my_table ENGINE = InnoDB;



	Then clicked the structure tab next to it, and copied the name of the first database (eg. ibf_ccs_folders )



	Clicked SQL tab and replaced the ""my_table"" bit with the database name, ending up with 



	ALTER TABLE ibf_ccs_folders ENGINE = InnoDB;



	I then clicked the Go button, bottom right.



	Then I copied the name of the second database. On returning to SQL I got a notice that it had saved my last query, so I let it paste it in, and then just replaced the first database name with the second database name and clicked GO.



	I repeated this manually for all databases (there's a lot). I kept thinking there must be a faster way, but I was so glad to have found a straight forward way to convert the databases I was happy to spend the time, which was quite satisfying.Glad to hear you got them all sorted 🙂",,,,,1,461,52.2,17.42,75.43,53.88,27.12,19.31,82,67.9,54.66,14.75,9.76,7.16,0,2.39,0,0.22,4.99,15.4,7.59,1.08,12.58,9.33,4.56,6.72,0.65,17.79,5.42,3.25,1.52,0.43,0.65,0.65,11.93,0.87,11.06,1.95,1.95,1.08,3.04,0.43,3.25,0.22,4.77,3.25,1.08,1.74,0.87,0.43,0,0,0,0,7.59,3.47,1.95,0.87,0,0.22,1.74,4.12,0,0,0,0.22,3.04,0,0,3.04,1.3,0,0,1.08,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.08,0,0.22,0,0.22,0.22,0.22,4.34,7.16,0.87,1.3,5.21,0.22,0.22,0.22,4.12,5.64,4.56,0.22,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,15.62,3.69,3.69,0.65,0,2.6,4.99,

Hardware/Software Implementation,"What does it mean to say that a function (e.g. modular multiplication,sine) is implemented in hardware as opposed to software?Implemented in hardware means the electrical circuit (through logical gates and so) can perform the operation.

For example, in the ALU the processor is physically able to add one byte to another.

Implemented in software are operations that usually are very complex combinations of basic implemented in hardware functions.Typically, ""software"" is a list of instructions from a small set of precise formal instructions supported by the hardware in question. The hardware (the cpu) runs in an infinite loop executing your instruction stream stored in ""memory"".

When we talk about a software implementation of an algorithm, we mean that we achieve the final answer by having the CPU carry out some set of these instructions in the order put together by an outside programmer.

When we talk about a hardware implementation, we mean that the final answer is carried out with intermediate steps that don't come from a formal (inefficient) software stream coded up by a programmer but instead is carried out with intermediate steps that are not exposed to the outside world. Hardware implementations thus are likely to be faster because (a) they can be very particular to the algorithm being implemented, with no need to reach well-defined states that the outside would will see, and (b) don't have to sync up with the outside world.

Note, that I am calling things like sine(x), ""algorithms"".

To be more specific about efficiency, the software instructions, being a part of a formal interface, have predefined start/stop points as they await for the next clock cycle. These sync points are needed to some extent to allow other software instructions and other hardware to cleanly and unambiguously access these well defined calculations. In contrast, a hardware implementation is more likely to have a larger amount of its internal implementations be asynchronous, meaning that they run to completion instead of stopping at many intermediate points to await a clock tick.

For example, most processors have an instruction that carries out an integer addition. The entire process of calculating the final bit positions is likely done asynchronously. The stop/sync point occurs only after the added result is achieved. In turn, a more complex algorithm than ""add"", and which is done in software that contains many such additions, necessarily is partly carried out asynchronously (eg, in between each addition) but with many sync points (after each addition, jump, test, etc, result is known). If that more complex algorithm were done entirely in hardware, it's possible it would run to completion from beginning to end entirely independent of the timing clock. No outside program instructions would be consulted during the hardware calculation of that algorithm.It means that the logic behind it is in the hardware (ie, using gates AND/OR/XOR, etc) rather than a software recreation of said hardware logic.Hardware implementation means typically that a circuit was created to perform the refered operation. There is no need for a CPU nor virtual calculations. You can literally see the algorithm being performed through the lines and architecture of the circuit itself.",,,,,1,530,90.04,30.6,67.14,30.51,27.89,28.87,85.66,66.79,53.4,7.55,2.08,0.19,0.94,0.38,0,0.57,5.47,17.36,9.62,0.38,17.17,9.06,4.34,4.15,1.32,15.09,7.74,6.6,2.83,1.13,0.94,0.75,13.02,0.57,12.45,3.58,0.94,1.7,2.08,0.75,3.4,0.19,1.13,0.94,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.04,4.15,0.19,0,0.19,0,3.02,1.89,0,0,0,0,6.23,0,0,6.23,4.15,0.19,0,3.96,0,0,0.38,0.38,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0.57,0,0,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,0.19,4.91,10.94,0,3.21,7.74,0.38,0,0,4.15,2.64,5.85,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,16.42,4.53,4.91,0.19,0,0.57,6.23,

How are software license keys generated?,"License keys are the defacto-standard as an anti-piracy measure. To be honest, this strikes me as (in)Security Through Obscurity, although I really have no idea how license keys are generated. What is a good (secure) example of license key generation? What cryptographic primitive (if any) are they using? Is it a message digest? If so, what data would they be hashing? What methods do developers employ to make it difficult for crackers to build their own key generators? How are key generators made?For old-school CD keys, it was just a matter of making up an algorithm for which CD keys (which could be any string) are easy to generate and easy to verify, but the ratio of valid-CD-keys to invalid-CD-keys is so small that randomly guessing CD keys is unlikely to get you a valid one.

Starcraft and Half-life both used the same checksum, where the 13th digit verified the first 12.  Thus, you could enter anything for the first 12 digits, and guess the 13th (there's only 10 possibilities), leading to the infamous 1234-56789-1234

The algorithm for verifying is public, and looks something like this:

x = 3;
for(int i = 0; i < 12; i++)
{
    x += (2 * x) ^ digit[i];
}
lastDigit = x % 10;


CORRECT WAY TO DO IT

Windows XP takes quite a bit of information, encrypts it, and puts the letter/number encoding on a sticker.  This allowed MS to both verify your key and obtain the product-type (Home, Professional, etc.) at the same time.  Additionally, it requires online activation.

The full algorithm is rather complex, but outlined nicely in this (completely legal!) paper, published in Germany.

Of course, no matter what you do, unless you are offering an online service (like World of Warcraft), any type of copy protection is just a stall:  unfortunately, if it's any game worth value, someone will break (or at least circumvent) the CD-key algorithm, and all other copyright protections.

REAL CORRECT WAY TO DO IT:

For online-services, life is a bit simpler, since even with the binary file you need to authenticate with their servers to make any use of it (eg. have a WoW account).  The CD-key algorithm for World of Warcraft - used, for instance, when buying playtime cards - probably looks something like this:


  
  Generate a very large cryptographically-secure random number.  
  Store it in our database and print it on the card.


  Then, when someone enters a playtime-card number, check if it's in the database, and if it is, associate that number with the current user so it can never be used again.
  


For online services, there is no reason not to use the above scheme; using anything else can lead to problems.When I originally wrote this answer it was under an assumption that the question was regarding 'offline' validation of licence keys.  Most of the other answers address online verification, which is significantly easier to handle (most of the logic can be done server side).

With offline verification the most difficult thing is ensuring that you can generate a huge number of unique licence keys, and still maintain a strong algorithm that isnt easily compromised (such as a simple check digit)

I'm not very well versed in mathematics, but it struck me that one way to do this is to use a mathematical function that plots a graph

The plotted line can have (if you use a fine enough frequency) thousands of unique points, so you can generate keys by picking random points on that graph and encoding the values in some way



As an example, we'll plot this graph, pick four points and encode into a string as ""0,-500;100,-300;200,-100;100,600""

We'll encrypt the string with a known and fixed key (horribly weak, but it serves a purpose), then convert the resulting bytes through Base32 to generate the final key

The application can then reverse this process (base32 to real number, decrypt, decode the points) and then check each of those points is on our secret graph.

Its a fairly small amount of code which would allow for a huge number of unique and valid keys to be generated

It is however very much security by obscurity. Anyone taking the time to disassemble the code would be able to find the graphing function and encryption keys, then mock up a key generator, but its probably quite useful for slowing down casual piracy.Check tis article on Partial Key Verification which covers the following requirements:


License keys must be easy enough to type in.
We must be able to blacklist (revoke) a license key in the case of chargebacks or purchases with stolen credit cards.
No “phoning home” to test keys.  Although this practice is becoming more and more prevalent, I still do not appreciate it as a user, so will not ask my users to put up with it.
It should not be possible for a cracker to disassemble our released application and produce a working “keygen” from it. This means that our application will not fully test a key for verification. Only some of the key is to be tested. Further, each release of the application should test a different portion of the key, so that a phony key based on an earlier release will not work on a later release of our software.
Important: it should not be possible for a legitimate user to accidentally type in an invalid key that will appear to work but fail on a future version due to a typographical error.I've not got any experience with what people actually do to generate CD keys, but (assuming you're not wanting to go down the road of online activation) here are a few ways one could make a key:


Require that the number be divisible by (say) 17.  Trivial to guess, if you have access to many keys, but the majority of potential strings will be invalid.  Similar would be requiring that the checksum of the key match a known value.
Require that the first half of the key, when concatenated with a known value, hashes down to the second half of the key.  Better, but the program still contains all the information needed to generate keys as well as to validate them.
Generate keys by encrypting (with a private key) a known value + nonce.  This can be verified by decrypting using the corresponding public key and verifying the known value.  The program now has enough information to verify the key without being able to generate keys.


These are still all open to attack: the program is still there and can be patched to bypass the check.  Cleverer might be to encrypt part of the program using the known value from my third method, rather than storing the value in the program.  That way you'd have to find a copy of the key before you could decrypt the program, but it's still vulnerable to being copied once decrypted and to having one person take their legit copy and use it to enable everyone else to access the software.CD-Keys aren't much of a security for any non-networked stuff, so technically they don't need to be securely generated. If you're on .net, you can almost go with Guid.NewGuid().

Their main use nowadays is for the Multiplayer component, where a server can verify the CD Key. For that, it's unimportant how securely it was generated as it boils down to ""Lookup whatever is passed in and check if someone else is already using it"".

That being said, you may want to use an algorhithm to achieve two goals:


Have a checksum of some sort. That allows your Installer to display ""Key doesn't seem valid"" message, solely to detect typos (Adding such a check in the installer actually means that writing a Key Generator is trivial as the hacker has all the code he needs. Not having the check and solely relying on server-side validation disables that check, at the risk of annoying your legal customers who don't understand why the server doesn't accept their CD Key as they aren't aware of the typo)
Work with a limited subset of characters. Trying to type in a CD Key and guessing ""Is this an 8 or a B? a 1 or an I? a Q or an O or a 0?"" - by using a subset of non-ambigous chars/digits you eliminate that confusion.


That being said, you still want a large distribution and some randomness to avoid a pirate simply guessing a valid key (that's valid in your database but still in a box on a store shelf) and screwing over a legitimate customer who happens to buy that box.The key system must have several properties:


very few keys must be valid
valid keys must not be derivable even given everything the user has.
a valid key on one system is not a valid key on another.
others


One solution that should give you these would be to use a public key signing scheme. Start with a ""system hash"" (say grab the macs on any NICs, sorted, and the CPU-ID info, plus some other stuff, concatenate it all together and take an MD5 of the result (you really don't want to be handling personally identifiable information if you don't have to)) append the CD's serial number and refuse to boot unless some registry key (or some datafile) has a valid signature for the blob. The user activates the program by shipping the blob to you and you ship back the signature.

Potential issues include that you are offering to sign practically anything so you need to assume someone will run a chosen plain text and/or chosen ciphertext attacks. That can be mitigated by checking the serial number provided and refusing to handle request from invalid ones as well as refusing to handle more than a given number of queries from a given s/n in an interval (say 2 per year)

I should point out a few things: First, a skilled and determined attacker will be able to bypass any and all security in the parts that they have unrestricted access to (i.e. everything on the CD), the best you can do on that account is make it harder to get illegitimate access than it is to get legitimate access. Second, I'm no expert so there could be serious flaws in this proposed scheme.If you aren't particularly concerned with the length of the key, a pretty tried and true method is the use of public and private key encryption.

Essentially have some kind of nonce and a fixed signature.

For example:
0001-123456789

Where 0001 is your nonce and 123456789 is your fixed signature.

Then encrypt this using your private key to get your CD key which is something like:
ABCDEF9876543210

Then distribute the public key with your application. The public key can be used to decrypt the CD key ""ABCDEF9876543210"", which you then verify the fixed signature portion of.

This then prevents someone from guessing what the CD key is for the nonce 0002 because they don't have the private key.

The only major down side is that your CD keys will be quite long when using private / public keys 1024-bit in size. You also need to choose a nonce long enough so you aren't encrypting a trivial amount of information.

The up side is that this method will work without ""activation"" and you can use things like an email address or licensee name as the nonce.I realize that this answer is about 10 years late to the party.
A good software license key/serial number generator consists of more than just a string of random characters or a value from some curve generator.  Using a limited alphanumeric alphabet, data can be embedded into a short string (e.g. XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX) that includes all kinds of useful information such as:

Date created or the date the license expires
Product ID, product classification, major and minor version numbers
Custom bits like a hardware hash
Per-user hash checksum bits (e.g. the user enters their email address along with the license key and both pieces of information are used to calculate/verify the hash).

The license key data is then encrypted and then encoded using the limited alphanumeric alphabet.  For online validation, the license server holds the secrets for decrypting the information.  For offline validation, the decryption secret(s) are included with the software itself along with the decryption/validation code.  Obviously, offline validation means the software isn't secure against someone making a keygen.
Probably the hardest part about creating a license key is figuring out how to cram as much data as possible into as few bytes as possible.  Remember that users will be entering in their license keys by hand, so every bit counts and users don't want to type extremely long, complex strings in.  16 to 25 character license keys are the most common and balance how much data can be placed into a key vs. user tolerance for entering the key to unlock the software.  Slicing up bytes into chunks of bits allows for more information to be included but does increase code complexity of both the generator and validator.
Encryption is a complex topic.  In general, standard encryption algorithms like AES have block sizes that don't align with the goal of keeping license key lengths short.  Therefore, most developers making their own license keys end up writing their own encryption algorithms (an activity which is frequently discouraged) or don't encrypt keys at all, which guarantees that someone will write a keygen.  Suffice it to say that good encryption is hard to do right and a decent understanding of how Feistel networks and existing ciphers work are prerequisites.
Verifying a key is a matter of decoding and decrypting the string, verifying the hash/checksum, checking the product ID and major and minor version numbers in the data, verifying that the license hasn't expired, and doing whatever other checks need to be performed.
Writing a keygen is a matter of knowing what a license key consists of and then producing the same output that the original key generator produces.  If the algorithm for license key verification is included in and used by the software, then it is just a matter of creating software that does the reverse of the verification process.
To see what the entire process looks like, here is a blog post I recently wrote that goes over choosing the license key length, the data layout, the encryption algorithm, and the final encoding scheme:
https://cubicspot.blogspot.com/2020/03/adventuring-deeply-into-software-serial.html
A practical, real-world implementation of the key generator and key verifier from the blog post can be seen here:
https://github.com/cubiclesoft/php-misc/blob/master/support/serial_number.php
Documentation for the above class:
https://github.com/cubiclesoft/php-misc/blob/master/docs/serial_number.md
A production-ready open source license server that generates and manages license keys using the above serial number code can be found here:
https://github.com/cubiclesoft/php-license-server
The above license server supports both online and offline validation modes.  A software product might start its existence with online only validation.  When the software product is ready to retire and no longer supported, it can easily move to offline validation where all existing keys continue to work once the user upgrades to the very last version of the software that switches over to offline validation.
A live demo of how the above license server can be integrated into a website to sell software licenses plus an installable demo application can be found here (both the website and demo app are open source too):
https://license-server-demo.cubiclesoft.com/
Full disclosure:  I'm the author of both the license server and the demo site software.There are also DRM behaviors that incorporate multiple steps to the process.  One of the most well known examples is one of Adobe's methods for verifying an installation of their Creative Suite.  The traditional CD Key method discussed here is used, then Adobe's support line is called.  The CD key is given to the Adobe representative and they give back an activation number to be used by the user.

However, despite being broken up into steps, this falls prey to the same methods of cracking used for the normal process.  The process used to create an activation key that is checked against the original CD key was quickly discovered, and generators that incorporate both of the keys were made.

However, this method still exists as a way for users with no internet connection to verify the product.  Going forward, it's easy to see how these methods would be eliminated as internet access becomes ubiquitous.All of the CD only copy protection algorithms inconvience honest users while providing no protection against piracy whatsoever.

The ""pirate"" only need to have access to one legitimate cd and its access code, he can then make n copies and distribute them.

It does not matter how cryptographically secure you make the code, you need to supply this with the CD in plain text or an legitimate user cannot activite the software.

Most secure schemes involve either the user providing the software supplier with some details of the machine which will run the software (cpu serial numbers, mac addresses, Ip address etc.), or, require online access to register the software on the suppliers website and in return receive an activitation token. The first option requires a lot of manual administration and is only worth it for very high value software, the, second option can be spoofed and is absolutly infuriating if you have limited network access or you are stuck behind a firewall.

On the whole its much easier to establish a trust relationship with your customers!You can use and implement Secure Licensing API from very easily in your Software Projects using it,(you need to download the desktop application for creating secure license from https://www.systemsoulsoftwares.com/)

Semantic Versioning Link : 
 https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#prerelease-identifiersThe basic idea to make this comparison would be to use Array.split to get arrays of parts from the input strings and then compare pairs of parts from the two arrays; if the parts are not equal we know which version is smaller.

There are a few of important details to keep in mind:


How should the parts in each pair be compared? The question wants to compare numerically, but what if we have version strings that are not made up of just digits (e.g. ""1.0a"")?
What should happen if one version string has more parts than the other? Most likely ""1.0"" should be considered less than ""1.0.1"", but what about ""1.0.0""?


Here's the code for an implementation that you can use directly (gist with documentation):

function versionCompare(v1, v2, options) {
    var lexicographical = options && options.lexicographical,
        zeroExtend = options && options.zeroExtend,
        v1parts = v1.split('.'),
        v2parts = v2.split('.');

    function isValidPart(x) {
        return (lexicographical ? /^\d+[A-Za-z]*$/ : /^\d+$/).test(x);
    }

    if (!v1parts.every(isValidPart) || !v2parts.every(isValidPart)) {
        return NaN;
    }

    if (zeroExtend) {
        while (v1parts.length < v2parts.length) v1parts.push(""0"");
        while (v2parts.length < v1parts.length) v2parts.push(""0"");
    }

    if (!lexicographical) {
        v1parts = v1parts.map(Number);
        v2parts = v2parts.map(Number);
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < v1parts.length; ++i) {
        if (v2parts.length == i) {
            return 1;
        }

        if (v1parts[i] == v2parts[i]) {
            continue;
        }
        else if (v1parts[i] > v2parts[i]) {
            return 1;
        }
        else {
            return -1;
        }
    }

    if (v1parts.length != v2parts.length) {
        return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}


This version compares parts naturally, does not accept character suffixes and considers ""1.7"" to be smaller than ""1.7.0"". The comparison mode can be changed to lexicographical and shorter version strings can be automatically zero-padded using the optional third argument.

There is a JSFiddle that runs ""unit tests"" here; it is a slightly expanded version of ripper234's work (thank you).

Important note: This code uses Array.map and Array.every, which means that it will not run in IE versions earlier than 9. If you need to support those you will have to provide polyfills for the missing methods.// Return 1 if a > b
// Return -1 if a < b
// Return 0 if a == b
function compare(a, b) {
    if (a === b) {
       return 0;

    var a_components = a.split(""."");
    var b_components = b.split(""."");

    var len = Math.min(a_components.length, b_components.length);

    // loop while the components are equal
    for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        // A bigger than B
        if (parseInt(a_components[i]) > parseInt(b_components[i])) {

        }

            return -1;
        }
    }

    // If one's a prefix of the other, the longer one is greater.
    if (a_components.length > b_components.length) {
        return 1;
    }

    if (a_components.length < b_components.length) {
        return -1;

console.log(compare(""1.0"", ""2.0""));
console.log(compare(""1.0.1"", ""1.0""));The simplest is to use localeCompare :
a.localeCompare(b, undefined, { numeric: true, sensitivity: 'base' })

This will return:

 0: version strings are equal
 1: version a is greater than b
-1: version b is greater than aThis very small, yet very fast compare function takes version numbers of any length and any number size per segment.

Return values:

- a number < 0 if a < b

- a number > 0 if a > b

- 0 if a = b  

So you can use it as compare function for Array.sort();

    }Couldn't find a function doing what I wanted here. So I wrote my own. This is my contribution. I hope someone find it useful.

Pros:


Handles version strings of arbitrary length. '1' or '1.1.1.1.1'.
Defaults each value to 0 if not specified. Just because a string is longer doesn't mean it's a bigger version. ('1' should be the same as '1.0' and '1.0.0.0'.)
Compare numbers not strings. ('3'<'21' should be true. Not false.)
Don't waste time on useless compares in the loop. (Comparing for ==)
You can choose your own comparator.


Cons:


It does not handle letters in the version string. (I don't know how that would even work?)

Simplest code for modern browsers: 

 function compareVersion2(ver1, ver2) {
      ver1 = ver1.split('.').map( s => s.padStart(10) ).join('.');
      ver2 = ver2.split('.').map( s => s.padStart(10) ).join('.');
      return ver1 <= ver2;
 }


The idea here is to compare numbers but in the form of string. to make the comparison work the two strings must be at the same length. so:

""123"" > ""99"" become ""123"" > ""099""

padding the short number ""fix"" the comparison

Here I padding each part with zeros to lengths of 10. then just use simple string compare for the answer

Example :

var ver1 = '0.2.10', ver2=`0.10.2`
//become 
ver1 = '0000000000.0000000002.0000000010'
ver2 = '0000000000.0000000010.0000000002'
// then it easy to see that
ver1 <= ver2 // trueI faced the similar issue, and I had already created a solution for it. Feel free to give it a try.
It returns 0 for equal, 1 if the version is greater and -1 if it is less

 Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippetAlthough this question already has a lot of answers, each one promotes their own backyard-brewn solution, whilst we have a whole ecosystem of (battle-)tested libraries for this.
A quick search on NPM, GitHub, X will give us some lovely libs, and I'd want to run through some:
semver-compare is a great lightweight (~230 bytes) lib that's especially useful if you want to sort by version numbers, as the library's exposed method returns -1, 0 or 1 appropriately.
The core of the library:
module.exports = function cmp (a, b) {
    var pa = a.split('.');
    var pb = b.split('.');
    for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        var na = Number(pa[i]);
        var nb = Number(pb[i]);
        if (na > nb) return 1;
        if (nb > na) return -1;
        if (!isNaN(na) && isNaN(nb)) return 1;
        if (isNaN(na) && !isNaN(nb)) return -1;
    }
    return 0;
};

compare-semver is rather hefty in size (~4.4 kB gzipped), but allows for some nice unique comparisons like to find the minimum/maximum of a stack of versions or to find out if the provided version is unique or less than anything else in a collection of versions.
compare-versions is another small library (~630 bytes gzipped) and follows the spec nicely, meaning you can compare versions with alpha/beta flags and even wildcards (like for minor/patch versions: 1.0.x or 1.0.*)
The point being: there's not always a need to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow, if you can find decent, (unit-)tested versions via your package manager of choice.Forgive me if this idea already been visited in a link I have not seen.

I have had some success with conversion of the parts into a weighted sum like so:

partSum = this.major * Math.Pow(10,9);
partSum += this.minor * Math.Pow(10, 6);
partSum += this.revision * Math.Pow(10, 3);
partSum += this.build * Math.Pow(10, 0);


Which made comparisons very easy (comparing a double).
Our version fields are never more than 4 digits.

7.10.2.184  -> 7010002184.0
7.11.0.1385 -> 7011001385.0


I hope this helps someone, as the multiple conditionals seem a bit overkill.A dead simple way:
function compareVer(previousVersion, currentVersion) {
 try {
    const [prevMajor, prevMinor = 0, prevPatch = 0] = previousVersion.split('.').map(Number);
    const [curMajor, curMinor = 0, curPatch = 0] = currentVersion.split('.').map(Number);

    if (curMajor > prevMajor) {
      return 'major update';
    }
    if (curMajor < prevMajor) {
      return 'major downgrade';
    }
    if (curMinor > prevMinor) {
      return 'minor update';
    }
    if (curMinor < prevMinor) {
      return 'minor downgrade';
    }
    if (curPatch > prevPatch) {
      return 'patch update';
    }
    if (curPatch < prevPatch) {
      return 'patch downgrade';
    }
    return 'same version';
  } catch (e) {
    return 'invalid format';
  }
}

Output:
compareVer(""3.1"", ""3.1.1"") // patch update
compareVer(""3.1.1"", ""3.2"") // minor update
compareVer(""2.1.1"", ""1.1.1"") // major downgrade
compareVer(""1.1.1"", ""1.1.1"") // same versionCheck the function version_compare() from the php.js project. It's is similar to PHP's version_compare().

You can simply use it like this:

version_compare('2.0', '2.0.0.1', '<'); 
// returns trueMy less verbose answer than most of the answers here

/**
 * Compare two semver versions. Returns true if version A is greater than
 * version B
 * @param {string} versionA
 * @param {string} versionB
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
export const semverGreaterThan = function(versionA, versionB){
  var versionsA = versionA.split(/\./g),
    versionsB = versionB.split(/\./g)
  while (versionsA.length || versionsB.length) {
    var a = Number(versionsA.shift()), b = Number(versionsB.shift())
    if (a == b)
      continue
    return (a > b || isNaN(b))
  }
  return false
}You could use String#localeCompare with options

sensitivity
Which differences in the strings should lead to non-zero result values. Possible values are:

""base"": Only strings that differ in base letters compare as unequal. Examples: a ≠ b, a = á, a = A.
""accent"": Only strings that differ in base letters or accents and other diacritic marks compare as unequal. Examples: a ≠ b, a ≠ á, a = A.
""case"": Only strings that differ in base letters or case compare as unequal. Examples: a ≠ b, a = á, a ≠ A.
""variant"": Strings that differ in base letters, accents and other diacritic marks, or case compare as unequal. Other differences may also be taken into consideration. Examples: a ≠ b, a ≠ á, a ≠ A.

The default is ""variant"" for usage ""sort""; it's locale dependent for usage ""search"".
numeric
Whether numeric collation should be used, such that ""1"" < ""2"" < ""10"". Possible values are true and false; the default is false. This option can be set through an options property or through a Unicode extension key; if both are provided, the options property takes precedence. Implementations are not required to support this property.

localCompare has been around for some time
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator/Collator
But what about 1.0a and 1.0.1
localCompare doesn't solve that, still returns 1.0.1 , 1.0a
Michael Deal in his (longish &complex) solution already cracked that in 2013
He converts Numbers to another Base, so they can be sorted better
His answer got me thinking...
666 - Don't think in numbers - 999
Sorting is alphanumeric, based on the ASCII values, so let's (ab)use ASCII as the ""base""
My solution is to convert 1.0.2.1 to  b.a.c.b to  bacb , and then sort
This solves 1.1 vs. 1.0.0.0.1 with: bb vs. baaab
And immediately solves the 1.0a and 1.0.1 sorting problem with notation: baa and bab
Conversion is done with:
    const str = s => s.match(/(\d+)|[a-z]/g)
                      .map(c => c == ~~c ? String.fromCharCode(97 + c) : c);

= Calculate ASCII value for 0...999 Numbers, otherwise concat letter
1.0a >>> [ ""1"" , ""0"" , ""a"" ] >>> [ ""b"" , ""a"" , ""a"" ]
For comparison sake there is no need to concatenate it to one string with .join("""")
Oneliner
const sortVersions=(x,v=s=>s.match(/(\d+)|[a-z]/g)
                            .map(c=>c==~~c?String.fromCharCode(97+c):c))
                    =>x.sort((a,b)=>v(b)<v(a)?1:-1)

Test snippet:


function log(label,val){
  document.body.append(label,String(val).replace(/,/g,"" - ""),document.createElement(""BR""));
}

let v = [""1.90.1"", ""1.9.1"", ""1.89"", ""1.090"", ""1.2"", ""1.0a"", ""1.0.1"", ""1.10"", ""1.0.0a""];
log('not sorted input :',v);

v.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b,undefined,{numeric:true,sensitivity:'base'   }));
log(' locale Compare :', v); // 1.0a AFTER 1.0.1

const str = s => s.match(/(\d+)|[a-z]/g)
                  .map(c => c == ~~c ? String.fromCharCode(97 + c) : c);
const versionCompare = (a, b) => {
  a = str(a);
  b = str(b);
  return b < a ? 1 : a == b ? 0 : -1;
}

Note how 1.090 is sorted in both results.
My code will not solve the 001.012.001 notation mentioned in one answer, but the localeCompare gets that part of the challenge right.
You could combine the two methods:

sort with .localCompare OR versionCompare when there is a letter involved

  x,
  v = s => s.match(/[a-z]|\d+/g).map(c => c==~~c ? String.fromCharCode(97 + c) : c)

a.localeCompare(b, undefined, { numeric: true })
Here is an example:
""1.1"".localeCompare(""2.1.1"", undefined, { numeric: true }) => -1
""1.0.0"".localeCompare(""1.0"", undefined, { numeric: true }) => 1
""1.0.0"".localeCompare(""1.0.0"", undefined, { numeric: true }) => 0// Returns true if v1 is bigger than v2, and false if otherwise.
function isNewerThan(v1, v2) {
      v1=v1.split('.');
      v2=v2.split('.');
      for(var i = 0; i<Math.max(v1.length,v2.length); i++){
        if(v1[i] == undefined) return false; // If there is no digit, v2 is automatically bigger
        if(v2[i] == undefined) return true; // if there is no digit, v1 is automatically bigger
        if(v1[i] > v2[i]) return true;
        if(v1[i] < v2[i]) return false;
      }
      return false; // Returns false if they are equal
    }The idea is to compare two versions and know which is the biggest. We delete ""."" and we compare each position of the vector with the other.
// Return 1  if a > b
// Return -1 if a < b
// Return 0  if a == b

function compareVersions(a_components, b_components) {

   if (a_components === b_components) {
       return 0;
   }

   var partsNumberA = a_components.split(""."");
   var partsNumberB = b_components.split(""."");

   for (var i = 0; i < partsNumberA.length; i++) {

      var valueA = parseInt(partsNumberA[i]);
      var valueB = parseInt(partsNumberB[i]);

      // A bigger than B
      if (valueA > valueB || isNaN(valueB)) {
         return 1;
      }

      // B bigger than A
      if (valueA < valueB) {
         return -1;
      }
   }
}The replace() function only replaces the first occurence in the string. So, lets replace the . with ,. Afterwards delete all . and make the , to . again and parse it to float.

for(i=0; i<versions.length; i++) {
    v = versions[i].replace('.', ',');
    v = v.replace(/\./g, '');
    versions[i] = parseFloat(v.replace(',', '.'));
}


finally, sort it:

versions.sort();Check out this blog post. This function works for numeric version numbers. 

function compVersions(strV1, strV2) {
  var nRes = 0
    , parts1 = strV1.split('.')
    , parts2 = strV2.split('.')
    , nLen = Math.max(parts1.length, parts2.length);

  for (var i = 0; i < nLen; i++) {
    var nP1 = (i < parts1.length) ? parseInt(parts1[i], 10) : 0
      , nP2 = (i < parts2.length) ? parseInt(parts2[i], 10) : 0;

    if (isNaN(nP1)) { nP1 = 0; }
    if (isNaN(nP2)) { nP2 = 0; }

    if (nP1 != nP2) {
      nRes = (nP1 > nP2) ? 1 : -1;
      break;
    }
  }

  return nRes;
};

compVersions('10', '10.0'); // 0
compVersions('10.1', '10.01.0'); // 0
compVersions('10.0.1', '10.0'); // 1
compVersions('10.0.1', '10.1'); // -1If, for example, we want to check if the current jQuery version is less than 1.8, parseFloat($.ui.version) < 1.8 ) would give a wrong result if version is ""1.10.1"", since parseFloat(""1.10.1"") returns 1.1.
A string compare would also go wrong, since ""1.8"" < ""1.10"" evaluates to false.

So we need a test like this

if(versionCompare($.ui.version, ""1.8"") < 0){
    alert(""please update jQuery"");
}


The following function handles this correctly:

/** Compare two dotted version strings (like '10.2.3').

console.assert(versionCompare(""1.8"",      ""1.10"")     <   0);
console.assert(versionCompare(""1.10.1"",   ""1.10.1"")   === 0);
// Longer is considered 'greater'
console.assert(versionCompare(""1.10.1.0"", ""1.10.1"")   >   0);
console.assert(versionCompare(""1.10.1"",   ""1.10.1.0"") <   0);
// Strings pairs are accepted
console.assert(versionCompare(""1.x"",      ""1.x"")      === 0);
// Mixed int/string pairs return NaN
console.assert(isNaN(versionCompare(""1.8"", ""1.x"")));
//works with plain numbers
console.assert(versionCompare(""4"", 3)   >   0);


See here for a live sample and test suite: 
http://jsfiddle.net/mar10/8KjvP/This is a neat trick. If you are dealing with numeric values, between a specific range of values, you can assign a value to each level of the version object. For instance ""largestValue"" is set to 0xFF here, which creates a very ""IP"" sort of look to your versioning. 

This also handles alpha-numeric versioning (i.e. 1.2a < 1.2b)

// The version compare function
function compareVersion(data0, data1, levels) {
    function getVersionHash(version) {
        var value = 0;
        version = version.split(""."").map(function (a) {
            var n = parseInt(a);
            var letter = a.replace(n, """");
            if (letter) {
                return n + letter[0].charCodeAt() / 0xFF;
            } else {
                return n;
            }
        });
        for (var i = 0; i < version.length; ++i) {
            if (levels === i) break;
            value += version[i] / 0xFF * Math.pow(0xFF, levels - i + 1);
        }
        return value;
    };
    var v1 = getVersionHash(data0);
    var v2 = getVersionHash(data1);
    return v1 === v2 ? -1 : v1 > v2 ? 0 : 1;
};
// Returns 0 or 1, correlating to input A and input B
// Direct match returns -1
var version = compareVersion(""1.254.253"", ""1.254.253a"", 3);I made this based on Kons idea, and optimized it for Java version ""1.7.0_45"". It's just a function meant to convert a version string to a float. This is the function:

function parseVersionFloat(versionString) {
    var versionArray = ("""" + versionString)
            .replace(""_"", ""."")
            .replace(/[^0-9.]/g, """")
            .split("".""),
        sum = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < versionArray.length; ++i) {
        sum += Number(versionArray[i]) / Math.pow(10, i * 3);
    }
    console.log(versionString + "" -> "" + sum);
    return sum;
}


String ""1.7.0_45"" is converted to 1.0070000450000001 and this is good enough for a normal comparison. Error explained here: How to deal with floating point number precision in JavaScript?. If need more then 3 digits on any part you can change the divider Math.pow(10, i * 3);.

Output will look like this:

1.7.0_45         > 1.007000045
ver 1.7.build_45 > 1.007000045
1.234.567.890    > 1.23456789Here's a coffeescript implementation suitable for use with Array.sort inspired by other answers here:

# Returns > 0 if v1 > v2 and < 0 if v1 < v2 and 0 if v1 == v2
compareVersions = (v1, v2) ->
  v1Parts = v1.split('.')
  v2Parts = v2.split('.')
  minLength = Math.min(v1Parts.length, v2Parts.length)
  if minLength > 0
    for idx in [0..minLength - 1]
      diff = Number(v1Parts[idx]) - Number(v2Parts[idx])
      return diff unless diff is 0
  return v1Parts.length - v2Parts.lengthI wrote a node module for sorting versions, you can find it here: version-sort

How can I disable landscape mode in Android?,"How can I disable landscape mode for some of the views in my Android app?Add android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" to the activity in the AndroidManifest.xml. For example:
<activity android:name="".SomeActivity""
          android:label=""@string/app_name""
          android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" />

Since this has become a super-popular answer, I feel very guilty as forcing portrait is rarely the right solution to the problems it's frequently applied to. 

The major caveats with forced portrait:

This does not absolve you of having to think about activity
lifecycle events or properly saving/restoring state. There are plenty of
things besides app rotation that can trigger an activity
destruction/recreation, including unavoidable things like multitasking. There are no shortcuts; learn to use bundles and retainInstance fragments.
Keep in mind that unlike the fairly uniform iPhone experience, there are some devices where portrait is not the clearly popular orientation. When users are on devices with hardware keyboards or game pads a la the Nvidia Shield, on Chromebooks, on foldables, or on Samsung DeX, forcing portrait can make your app experience either limiting or a giant usability hassle. If your app doesn't have a strong UX argument that would lead to a negative experience for supporting other orientations, you should probably not force landscape. I'm talking about things like ""this is a cash register app for one specific model of tablet always used in a fixed hardware dock.""

So most apps should just let the phone sensors, software, and physical configuration make their own decision about how the user wants to interact with your app. A few cases you may still want to think about, though, if you're not happy with the default behavior of sensor orientation in your use case:

If your main concern is accidental orientation changes mid-activity that you think the device's sensors and software won't cope with well (for example, in a tilt-based game) consider supporting landscape and portrait, but using nosensor for the orientation. This forces landscape on most tablets and portrait on most phones, but I still wouldn't recommend this for most ""normal"" apps (some users just like to type in the landscape softkeyboard on their phones, and many tablet users read in portrait - and you should let them).
If you still need to force portrait for some reason, sensorPortrait may be better than portrait for Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and later; this allows for upside-down portrait, which is quite common in tablet usage.I was not aware of the AndroidManifest.xml file switch until reading this post, so in my apps I have used this instead:
setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT); // Fixed portrait orientationAdd android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" in your manifest file where you declare your activity. Like this:
<activity 
    android:name="".yourActivity""
    ....
    android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" />

If you want to do it using Java code, try:
setRequestedOrientation (ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);

before you call setContentView method for your activity in onCreate().A lot of the answers here are suggesting to use ""portrait"" in your AndroidManifest.xml file.  This might seem like a good solution - but as noted in the documentation, you are singling out devices that may only have landscape.  You are also forcing certain devices (that work best in landscape) to go into portrait, not getting the proper orientation.

My suggestion is to use ""nosensor"" instead.  This will leave the device to use its default preferred orientation, will not block any purchases/downloads on Google Play, and will ensure the sensor doesn't mess up your (NDK, in my case) game.If you want to disable Landscape mode for your Android app (or a single activity) all you need to do is add:
android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" to the activity tag in AndroidManifest.xml file.
Like:
<activity 
    android:name=""YourActivityName""
    android:icon=""@drawable/ic_launcher""
    android:label=""Your App Name""
    android:screenOrientation=""portrait"">

Another way: A programmatic approach.
If you want to do this programmatically, i.e., using Java code. You can do so by adding the below code in the Java class of the activity that you don't want to be displayed in landscape mode.
setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);Just add this line in your Manifest:
android:screenOrientation=""portrait""

Like:
<manifest
    package=""com.example.speedtest""
    android:versionCode=""1""
    android:versionName=""1.0"" >

    <application
        android:allowBackup=""true""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_launcher""
        android:label=""@string/app_name""
        android:theme=""@style/AppTheme"" >

        <activity
            android:name=""ComparisionActivity""
            android:label=""@string/app_name""
            android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" >
        </activity>

    </application>

</manifest>If you want user-settings, then I'd recommend setRequestedOrientation (ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);
You can change the settings from a settings menu.
I require this because my timers must correspond to what's on the screen, and rotating the screen will destroy the current activity.You can do this for your entire application without having to make all your activities extend a common base class.

The trick is first to make sure you include an Application subclass in your project. In its onCreate(), called when your app first starts up, you register an ActivityLifecycleCallbacks object (API level 14+) to receive notifications of activity lifecycle events.

This gives you the opportunity to execute your own code whenever any activity in your app is started (or stopped, or resumed, or whatever). At this point you can call setRequestedOrientation() on the newly created activity.

And do not forget to add app:name="".MyApp"" in your manifest file.

class MyApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();  

        // register to be informed of activities starting up
        registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(new ActivityLifecycleCallbacks() {

            @Override
            public void onActivityCreated(Activity activity, 
                                          Bundle savedInstanceState) {

                // new activity created; force its orientation to portrait
                activity.setRequestedOrientation(
                    ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);
            }
            ....
        });
    }
}Use this in onCreate() of the Activity

setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);You should change android:screenOrientation=""sensorPortrait"" in AndroidManifest.xmlJust add this attribute in your activity tag.

 android:screenOrientation=""portrait""If you don't want to go through the hassle of adding orientation in each manifest entry of activity better, create a BaseActivity class (inherits 'Activity' or 'AppCompatActivity') which will be inherited by every activity of your application instead of 'Activity' or 'AppCompatActivity' and just add the following piece of code in your BaseActivity:

@Override
protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setRequestedOrientation (ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);
    // rest of your code......
}Add android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" to the activity you want to disable landscape mode in.How to change orientation in some of the view
Instead of locking orientation of the entire activity, you can use this class to dynamically lock orientation from any of your view pragmatically:
Make your view Landscape
OrientationUtils.lockOrientationLandscape(mActivity);

Make your view Portrait
OrientationUtils.lockOrientationPortrait(mActivity);

Unlock Orientation
OrientationUtils.unlockOrientation(mActivity);

    public static void lockOrientation(Activity activity) {
        final int orientation = activity.getResources().getConfiguration().orientation;
        final int rotation = ((WindowManager) activity.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE)).getDefaultDisplay()
                .getRotation();

        // Copied from Android docs, since we don't have these values in Froyo

        if (rotation == Surface.ROTATION_0 || rotation == Surface.ROTATION_90) {
            if (orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT) {

    }

    /** Unlocks the device window in user defined screen mode. */
    public static void unlockOrientation(Activity activity) {
        activity.setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_USER);
    }

}Use:
android:configChanges=""keyboardHidden|orientation""
android:screenOrientation=""portrait""You must set the orientation of each activity.

</activity>If you are using Xamarin C#, some of these solutions will not work. Here is the solution I found to work.
[Activity(MainLauncher = true, Icon = ""@drawable/icon"", ScreenOrientation = ScreenOrientation.Portrait)]

Above the class works well, similar to the other solutions. Also, it is not globally applicable and needs to be placed in each activity header.Put it into your manifest.
<activity
    android:name="".MainActivity""
    android:label=""@string/app_name""
    android:screenOrientation=""sensorPortrait"" />

The orientation will be portrait, but if the user's phone is upside down, it shows the correct way as well. (So your screen will rotate 180 degrees.)

The system ignores this attribute if the activity is running in multi-window mode.
More: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-elementAdd a class inside the oncreate() method:
setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);You can force your particular activity to always remain in portrait mode by writing this in your manifest.xml file:
<activity
    android:name="".MainActivity""
    android:screenOrientation=""portrait""></activity>

You can also force your activity to remain in portrait mode by writing following line in your activity's onCreate() method:
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.your_layout);
    setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);
}<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<manifest xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    package=""in.co.nurture.bajajfinserv"">
    <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.INTERNET""></uses-permission>

    <application

        android:allowBackup=""true""
        android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher""
        android:label=""@string/app_name""
        android:roundIcon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher_round""
        android:supportsRtl=""true""
        android:theme=""@style/AppTheme"">
        <activity android:name="".MainActivity"" android:screenOrientation=""portrait"">

            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" />

                <category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>

We can restrict the Activity in portrait or landscape mode by using the attribute or android:screenOrientation.
If we have more than one activity in our program then we have the freedom to restrict any one of activity in any one the mode and it never affects the others which you don't want.Either in the manifest class:
<activity android:name="".yourActivity""
    ....
    android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" />

Or programmatically:
setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);

Note: you should call this before setContentView method for your activity in onCreate().Add the below command to your project,
npm install

npm i react-native-orientation-locker

Then you use a manifest class like,
React_Native (Your Project Folder)/
android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:
<manifest xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
  package=""com.payroll_react"">

  <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.INTERNET"" />
  <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW""/>

  <application
    android:name="".MainApplication""
    android:label=""@string/app_name""
    android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher""
    android:allowBackup=""false""
    android:theme=""@style/AppTheme"">
    <activity
      android:name="".MainActivity""
      android:label=""@string/app_name""
      android:screenOrientation=""landscape""
      android:configChanges=""keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize""
      android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustResize"">
      <intent-filter>
          <action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" />
          <category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"" />
      </intent-filter>
    </activity>
    <activity android:name=""com.facebook.react.devsupport.DevSettingsActivity"" />
  </application>

</manifest>In the <apphome>/platform/android directory, create AndroidManifest.xml (copying it from the generated one).
Then add android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" to all of the activity elements.Add android:screenOrientation=""portrait"" in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
For example:
<activity 
    android:name="".MapScreen""
    android:screenOrientation=""portrait""></activity>It worked for me. Try to add this code in the AndroidManifest file:
<application
    android:allowBackup=""true""
    android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher""
    android:label=""@string/app_name""
    android:roundIcon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher_round""
    android:supportsRtl=""true""
    android:screenOrientation=""portrait""
    android:theme=""@style/AppTheme"">
    ....
    ....
</application>The following attribute on the activity in AndroidManifest.xml is all you need:
android:configChanges=""orientation""

So, full activity node:
<activity
    android:name=""Activity1""
    android:icon=""@drawable/icon""
    android:label=""App Name""
    android:configChanges=""orientation"">In Kotlin, the same can be programmatically achieved using the below:
requestedOrientation = ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAITIf your activity is related to the first device orientation state, get the current device orientation in the onCreate method and then fix it forever:
int deviceRotation = ((WindowManager) getBaseContext().getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE)).getDefaultDisplay().getOrientation();

if(deviceRotation == Surface.ROTATION_0) {
    setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);
}
else if(deviceRotation == Surface.ROTATION_180)
{
    setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_REVERSE_PORTRAIT);
}
else if(deviceRotation == Surface.ROTATION_90)
{
    setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE);
}
else if(deviceRotation == Surface.ROTATION_270)
{
    setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_REVERSE_LANDSCAPE);

How can I generate a Git patch for a specific commit?,"I need to write a script that creates patches for a list of SHA-1 commit numbers. I tried using git format-patch <the SHA1>, but that generated a patch for each commit since that SHA-1 value. After a few hundred patches were generated, I had to kill the process. Is there a way to generate a patch only for the specific SHA-1 value?Try:
git format-patch -1 <sha>

or
git format-patch -1 HEAD

According to the documentation link above, the -1 flag tells Git how many commits should be included in the patch;

-<n>
    
Prepare patches from the topmost  commits.


Apply the patch with the command:
git am < file.patchFor generating the patches from the topmost <n> commits from a specific SHA-1 hash:
git format-patch -<n> <SHA-1> --stdout > <name_of_patch_file>.patch

The last 10 patches from head in a single patch files:
git format-patch -10 HEAD --stdout > 0001-last-10-commits.patchSay you have commit id 2 after commit 1 you would be able to run:
git diff 2 1 > mypatch.diff

where 2 and 1 are SHA-1 hashes.git format-patch commit_Id~1..commit_Id  
git apply patch-file-name


Fast and simple solution.If you want to be sure the (single commit) patch will be applied on top of a specific commit, you can use the new git 2.9 (June 2016) option git format-patch --base
git format-patch --base=COMMIT_VALUE~ -M -C COMMIT_VALUE~..COMMIT_VALUE

# or
git format-patch --base=auto -M -C COMMIT_VALUE~..COMMIT_VALUE

# or
git config format.useAutoBase true
git format-patch -M -C COMMIT_VALUE~..COMMIT_VALUE

format-patch: add '--base' option to record base tree info


Maintainers or third party testers may want to know the exact base tree
the patch series applies to. Teach git format-patch a '--base' option
to record the base tree info and append it at the end of the first
message (either the cover letter or the first patch in the series).
The base tree info consists of the ""base commit"", which is a well-known
commit that is part of the stable part of the project history everybody
else works off of, and zero or more ""prerequisite patches"", which are
well-known patches in flight that is not yet part of the ""base commit""
that need to be applied on top of ""base commit"" in topological order
before the patches can be applied.
The ""base commit"" is shown as ""base-commit: "" followed by the 40-hex of
the commit object name.

A ""prerequisite patch"" is shown as ""prerequisite-patch-id: "" followed by the 40-hex ""patch id"", which can be obtained by passing the patch through the ""git patch-id --stable"" command.


Git 2.23 (Q3 2019) will improve that, because the ""--base"" option of ""format-patch"" computed the patch-ids for prerequisite patches in an unstable way, which has been updated to compute in a way that is compatible with ""git patch-id --stable"".

format-patch: make --base patch-id output stable


We weren't flushing the context each time we processed a hunk in the
patch-id generation code in diff.c, but we were doing that when we
generated ""stable"" patch-ids with the 'patch-id' tool.
Let's port that similar logic over from patch-id.c into diff.c so we can get the same hash when we're generating patch-ids for 'format-patch --base=' types of command invocations.


Before Git 2.24 (Q4 2019), ""git format-patch -o <outdir>"" did an equivalent of ""mkdir <outdir>"" not ""mkdir -p <outdir>"", which is being corrected.

format-patch: create leading components of output directory

'git format-patch -o ' did an equivalent of 'mkdir <outdir>' not 'mkdir -p <outdir>', which is being corrected.


Avoid the usage of 'adjust_shared_perm' on the leading directories which may have security implications. Achieved by temporarily disabling of 'config.sharedRepository' like 'git init' does.

rebase: fix format.useAutoBase breakage
Reported-by: Christian Biesinger

Signed-off-by: Denton Liu
With format.useAutoBase = true, running rebase resulted in an error:
fatal: failed to get upstream, if you want to record base commit automatically,
please use git branch --set-upstream-to to track a remote branch.
Or you could specify base commit by --base=<base-commit-id> manually
error:
git encountered an error while preparing the patches to replay
these revisions:

As a result, git cannot rebase them.

Fix this by always passing --no-base to format-patch from rebase so that the effect of format.useAutoBase is negated.


With Git 2.29 (Q4 2020), ""git format-patch""(man) learns to take ""whenAble"" as a possible value for the format.useAutoBase configuration variable to become no-op when the automatically computed base does not make sense.

format-patch: teach format.useAutoBase ""whenAble"" option
Signed-off-by: Jacob Keller


The format.useAutoBase configuration option exists to allow users to enable '--base=auto' for format-patch by default.
This can sometimes lead to poor workflow, due to unexpected failures when attempting to format an ancient patch:
$ git format-patch -1 <an old commit>
fatal: base commit shouldn't be in revision list  

This can be very confusing, as it is not necessarily immediately obvious that the user requested a --base (since this was in the configuration, not on the command line).
We do want --base=auto to fail when it cannot provide a suitable base, as it would be equally confusing if a formatted patch did not include the base information when it was requested.
Teach format.useAutoBase a new mode, ""whenAble"".
This mode will cause format-patch to attempt to include a base commit when it can. However, if no valid base commit can be found, then format-patch will continue formatting the patch without a base commit.
In order to avoid making yet another branch name unusable with --base, do not teach --base=whenAble or --base=whenable.
Instead, refactor the base_commit option to use a callback, and rely on the global configuration variable auto_base.
This does mean that a user cannot request this optional base commit generation from the command line. However, this is likely not too valuable. If the user requests base information manually, they will be immediately informed of the failure to acquire a suitable base commit. This allows the user to make an informed choice about whether to continue the format.
Add tests to cover the new mode of operation for --base.

git config now includes in its man page:

format-patch by default.

Can also be set to ""whenAble"" to allow
enabling --base=auto if a suitable base is available, but to skip
adding base info otherwise without the format dying.


With Git 2.30 (Q1 2021), ""git format-patch --output=there""(man) did not work as expected and instead crashed.

The option is now supported.

format-patch: support --output option
Reported-by: Johannes Postler

Signed-off-by: Jeff King


We've never intended to support diff's --output option in format-patch.
And until baa4adc66a (parse-options: disable option abbreviation with PARSE_OPT_KEEP_UNKNOWN, 2019-01-27, Git v2.22.0-rc0), it was impossible to trigger. We first parse the format-patch options before handing the remainder off to setup_revisions().

Before that commit, we'd accept ""--output=foo"" as an abbreviation for ""--output-directory=foo"". But afterwards, we don't check abbreviations, and --output gets passed to the diff code.
This results in nonsense behavior and bugs. The diff code will have opened a filehandle at rev.diffopt.file, but we'll overwrite that with our own handles that we open for each individual patch file. So the --output file will always just be empty.
But worse, the diff code also sets rev.diffopt.close_file, so log_tree_commit() will close the filehandle itself. And then the main loop in cmd_format_patch() will try to close it again, resulting in a double-free.
The simplest solution would be to just disallow --output with format-patch, as nobody ever intended it to work. However, we have accidentally documented it (because format-patch includes diff-options). And it does work with ""git log""(man) , which writes the whole output to the specified file. It's easy enough to make that work for format-patch, too: it's really the same as --stdout, but pointed at a specific file.
We can detect the use of the --output option by the ""close_file"" flag (note that we can't use rev.diffopt.file, since the diff setup will otherwise set it to stdout). So we just need to unset that flag, but don't have to do anything else. Our situation is otherwise exactly like --stdout (note that we don't fclose() the file, but nor does the stdout case; exiting the program takes care of that for us).Create a git patch using commit-id
$ git format-patch -1 commit-id

This command create patch with following file name
0001-commit-message.patch

To apply the patch:
$ git am 0001-commit-message.patchTo generate a patch from a specific commit (not the last commit):
git format-patch -M -C COMMIT_VALUE~1..COMMIT_VALUEIf you just want diff the specified file, you can use:

How can a software agency deliver quality software/win projects? [closed],"If you are concerned with doing too much work for too little money then work on an hourly basis. Yes, that is harder to sell in most situations.

Maybe you can try a two-phased approach instead. Have a very short initial engagement where the deliverables are very specific requirements documents that become the property of the client. You risk having to compete for the actual development but you take away the risk of pricing the project too low because you will already understand what the client is like to work with, as well as, the application requirements.

Once you win the work at a fair price then use the best practices suggested by mathieu to help ensure quality and productivity which both lower the cost you incur.What you described in your post, (not your question), I think is a sales, management and marketing question first and foremost. 

You say that your clients are not technically minded, this will require to have a cohesive sales, consulting and communications strategy, this isn't about programming skills.

Also, if your company constantly accepts projects that are too complex or expensive for your team, and you deliver low quality products you'll sooner or later be stuck in a hole. You will attract customers that you do not want, and existing clients will be turned off by your 'incompetence' and sooner or later find another company on which they'll try to play the same price game. Those clients are worth nothing in my opinion.

You ask 'how do you win well priced work'? People are social animals, they talk with each other. If there's a market perception that you are an unreliable company, people and future clients will sooner or later know. Customers don't care whether you offered them a product at a really low price, on a too tight schedule - It's not really their error, it's you who accepted it. So once again, I think whole ordeal is a bad business practice.

I found that you really have to define tight specs on jobs with low budgets, define what you will and can deliver, tell them the price, stop your boss from offering too many long term customer discount price tags because they are too afraid to lose the client. Communicate early and often when things start to get out of hand. Write precise offers for additional features. Write these precisely down, don't rely on phone conversations (you: ""that's an additional 4 hours of work"", client: ""ok""... 4 months later, client ""what was that again??? why am i supposed to pay for this"").

Now of course, one way you keep prices down is by not hiring complete morons that might be initially cheaper than better qualified programmers. This is a shortsighted approach and will fail miserably.It is the relationship with your customer that will win you additional business.  One developer actually stepped forward and halted a project because his sales consultant basically lied to us concerning a solution set.  The developer then offered a straight forward, bare bones solution within the same budget and he delivered on time.

This guy and his team has been consulting at my company now for over 6 years.  His integrity and earnest, hard working nature has been an immense advantage, and he has found quality people to work for him as his reputation has grown.  His honesty is worth more than any savings I could get by shipping my company's intellectual assets overseas.""so much competition from offshore/bedroom program teams"" - sounds like you guys need to put some time into networking.  At the end of the day, people like to do business with people, not with businesses.  If you're well known and liked in your client communities, you'll be the front-runners and you'll get a better price from the confidence you have built.  And referrals will give you a powerful edge - ask for them.

""our company does not have the money to turn down work"" - lot's of companies have this as a start point, but ultimately you have to get past this approach  The time you spend on these types of jobs stands in the way of being successful.   You need to make decisions about what type of work you want to do (and who the customers will be) and just as importantly what you don't do.This is my developer standpoint:


Version control best practices: Keep the trunk clean, don't commit code that doesn't compile, and commit frequently
Continuous integration
Unit testing (with code coverage)
Automatic deployment on test servers
Automatic packaging of the application
Automate as much as you can :)


Also, hire good developers, and treat them well :)Sell fixed price, fixed scope work, not hourly work. That mitigates your customer's risk of an over-run (you absorb all the risk, but you're doing that anyway), and frames the project in terms of the value of the software, not the quality of the effort going into it.We are trying to build a product and reuse existing experience. Comparing to UK in Ukraine (where I work) salaries are lower, but still 4-5 times higher than in India.

So far, the best result is to get two new clients, which need a similar solution, so we can offer better pricing and we are more confident in our estimate.

BTW, I checked out whywaitdigital.com, and it seems that we have a product which your clients might need. We do portals - editorial, B2C, geo-enabled product catalogs and we use ASP.NET MVC also. You can find contact information on our website, www.socialtalents.com.As a consultant, I have personally moved to an hourly-rate-only model for just this reason. I have been burned by too many contracts-gone-wild, and I feel your pain.

In the end, people who only ever go with the lowest priced proposal will be trouble for your company. While you can't be so choosy, such that you don't ever get projects, you definitely want to steer clear of contracts whose supporting management are so agnostic about the actual software development process that they only look at the initial price tag for something. Usually, it's the stuff not in the contract or specification that changes the profit margins and timelines.

It's often in you best interest to be picky up front rather than lowering prices in order to receive a wave of what end up to be trouble-clients anyway. In your case, while there's always the contention between an RFP that is not as concise as a technical requirements specification, initial quotes should be understood as a general estimate based on the level of clarity in the RFP.

And I definitely agree kitsune, that if your company is consistently accepting contracts that don't fit your company's development expertise or bandwidth, all that will result is overhead and bad reputation.",,,,,1,1136,39.49,86.16,35.15,45.38,24.7,22.01,90.23,70.51,55.11,14.17,9.15,1.32,0.88,5.11,0.7,0.79,5.02,14.26,6.69,0.97,12.24,9.6,6.25,7.13,1.85,16.29,7.22,4.84,6.34,1.41,4.23,1.06,12.32,0.62,11.53,2.2,1.32,1.76,2.29,0.88,4.14,0,3.87,2.73,1.06,0.97,0.44,0.44,0.09,0,0,0.09,13.56,2.82,0.53,0,0,0.09,1.41,10.3,0,0,0,0.88,0.53,0,0,0.53,11.36,0.35,0.09,8.01,3.96,0.09,0.44,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,1.23,0.26,1.41,0.26,0.09,0.18,0.53,0.7,0.18,6.95,6.69,0.26,0.97,4.84,0.09,0.09,0.35,5.02,1.76,5.37,2.64,0.53,0.26,0.26,0,0,16.81,4.93,5.19,0.35,0,2.64,3.7,

    }There is no direct way - see http://groups.google.com/group/android-platform/browse_thread/thread/1728f26f2334c060/5e4910f0d9eb898a where Dianne Hackborn from the Android team has replied. However, you can detect it indirectly by checking if the window size changed in #onMeasure. See How to check visibility of software keyboard in Android?.I created a simple class that can be used for this: https://github.com/ravindu1024/android-keyboardlistener. Just copy it in to your project and use as follows:

KeyboardUtils.addKeyboardToggleListener(this, new KeyboardUtils.SoftKeyboardToggleListener()
{
    @Override
    public void onToggleSoftKeyboard(boolean isVisible)
    {
        Log.d(""keyboard"", ""keyboard visible: ""+isVisible);
    }
});With the new feature WindowInsetsCompat in androidx core release 1.5.0-alpha02 you could check the visibility of the soft keyboard easily as below
Quoting from reddit comment

val View.keyboardIsVisible: Boolean
    get() = WindowInsetsCompat
        .toWindowInsetsCompat(rootWindowInsets)
        .isVisible(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime())


Some note about backward compatibility, quoting from release notes

New Features
The WindowInsetsCompat APIs have been updated to those in the platform
in Android 11. This includes the new ime() inset type, which allows
checking the visibility and size of the on-screen keyboard.
Some caveats about the ime() type, it works very reliably on API 23+
when your Activity is using the adjustResize window soft input mode.
If you’re instead using the adjustPan mode, it should work reliably
back to API 14.

Androidx Core 1.5.0-alpha02 release notes
WindowInsetsCompat DocsVery Easy
1. Put id on your root view
rootView is just a view pointing to my root view in this case a relative layout:
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
                android:layout_width=""match_parent""
                android:layout_height=""match_parent""
                android:id=""@+id/addresses_confirm_root_view""
                android:background=""@color/WHITE_CLR"">

2. Initialize your root view in your Activity:
RelativeLayout rootView = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.addresses_confirm_root_view);
3. Detect if keyboard is opened or closed by using getViewTreeObserver()
    rootView.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {
            @Override
            public void onGlobalLayout() {
                int heightDiff = rootView.getRootView().getHeight() - rootView.getHeight();
                
                if (heightDiff > 100) { // Value should be less than keyboard's height 
                    Log.e(""MyActivity"", ""keyboard opened"");
                } else { 
                    Log.e(""MyActivity"", ""keyboard closed"");
                }
            }
        });So after a long time of playing around with AccessibilityServices, window insets, screen height detection, etc, I think I found a way to do this.

Disclaimer: it uses a hidden method in Android, meaning it might not be consistent. However, in my testing, it seems to work.

The method is InputMethodManager#getInputMethodWindowVisibleHeight(), and it's existed since Lollipop (5.0).

Calling that returns the height, in pixels, of the current keyboard. In theory, a keyboard shouldn't be 0 pixels tall, so I did a simple height check (in Kotlin):

val imm by lazy { context.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE) as InputMethodManager }
if (imm.inputMethodWindowVisibleHeight > 0) {
    //keyboard is shown
else {
    //keyboard is hidden
}


I use Android Hidden API to avoid reflection when I call hidden methods (I do that a lot for the apps I develop, which are mostly hacky/tuner apps), but this should be possible with reflection as well:

val imm by lazy { context.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE) as InputMethodManager }
val windowHeightMethod = InputMethodManager::class.java.getMethod(""getInputMethodWindowVisibleHeight"")
val height = windowHeightMethod.invoke(imm) as Int
//use the height val in your logicI used this as a basis: https://rogerkeays.com/how-to-check-if-the-software-keyboard-is-shown-in-android
/**
* To capture the result of IMM hide/show soft keyboard
*/
public class IMMResult extends ResultReceiver {
     public int result = -1;
     public IMMResult() {
         super(null);
}

@Override 
public void onReceiveResult(int r, Bundle data) {
    result = r;
}

// poll result value for up to 500 milliseconds
public int getResult() {
    try {
        int sleep = 0;
        while (result == -1 && sleep < 500) {
            Thread.sleep(100);
            sleep += 100;
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Log.e(""IMMResult"", e.getMessage());
    }
    return result;
}
}

Then wrote this method:
public boolean isSoftKeyboardShown(InputMethodManager imm, View v) {
    
    IMMResult result = new IMMResult();
    int res;
    
    imm.showSoftInput(v, 0, result);

    // if keyboard doesn't change, handle the keypress
    res = result.getResult();
    if (res == InputMethodManager.RESULT_UNCHANGED_SHOWN ||
            res == InputMethodManager.RESULT_UNCHANGED_HIDDEN) {

        return true;
    }
    else
        return false;

}

You may then use this to test all fields (EditText, AutoCompleteTextView, etc) that may have opened a softkeyboard:
    InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getActivity().getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
    if(isSoftKeyboardShown(imm, editText1) | isSoftKeyboardShown(imm, autocompletetextview1))
        //close the softkeyboard
        imm.toggleSoftInput(InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED, 0);

Addmittely not an ideal solution, but it gets the job done.You can use WindowInsetsCompat from androidx.core (version 1.5.0-rc01).
This code will work from API 21 and above. Kotlin code example:
ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(root) { v, insets ->
    val isKeyboardVisible = insets.isVisible(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime())
    if (isKeyboardVisible) {
    }
}

root is the root view of your Activity.
Update
Today I was looking for how to detect keyboard visibility. At first, this code was not working. So I had to:

Add android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustResize"" to my AndroidManifest.xml file:

xml
        <activity android:name=""com.soumicslabs.activitykt.StartActivity""
            android:theme=""@style/AccountKitTheme.Default""
          android:configChanges=""orientation|screenSize""
          android:screenOrientation=""portrait""
          android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustResize""
          />


In your activity, set WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(window, false), this tells android that we want to manually handle things/don't want to use system defaults:

        val window = this.window
        WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(window, false)  // <-- this tells android not to use system defaults, so we have to setup quite a lot of behaviors manually


Finally, set you onApplyWindowInsetsListener:

val callBack = OnApplyWindowInsetsListener { view, insets ->
            val imeHeight = insets?.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime())?.bottom?:0
            Log.e(""tag"", ""onKeyboardOpenOrClose imeHeight = $imeHeight"")
// todo: logic
val isKeyboardVisible = insets.isVisible(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime())
    if (isKeyboardVisible) {
       // do something
    }else{
        // do something else
    }
    insets?: WindowInsetsCompat(null)
  }

ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(mainContainer, callBack)

This worked for me.You can use the callback result of showSoftInput() and hideSoftInput() to check for the status of the keyboard. Full details and example code at
https://rogerkeays.com/how-to-check-if-the-software-keyboard-is-shown-in-androidYou can refer to this answer - https://stackoverflow.com/a/24105062/3629912

It worked for me everytime.

adb shell dumpsys window InputMethod | grep ""mHasSurface""


It will return true, if software keyboard is visible.This was much less complicated for the requirements I needed. Hope this might help:

On the MainActivity:

public void dismissKeyboard(){
    InputMethodManager imm =(InputMethodManager)this.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
    imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(mSearchBox.getWindowToken(), 0);
    mKeyboardStatus = false;
}

public void showKeyboard(){
    InputMethodManager imm =(InputMethodManager)this.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
    imm.toggleSoftInput(InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED, InputMethodManager.HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY);
    mKeyboardStatus = true;
}

private boolean isKeyboardActive(){
    return mKeyboardStatus;
}


The default primative boolean value for mKeyboardStatus will be initialized to false. 

Then check the value as follows, and perform an action if necessary:

 mSearchBox.requestFocus();
    if(!isKeyboardActive()){
        showKeyboard();
    }else{
        dismissKeyboard();
    }This should work if you need to check keyboard status:

fun Activity.isKeyboardOpened(): Boolean {
    val r = Rect()

    val activityRoot = getActivityRoot()
    val visibleThreshold = dip(UiUtils.KEYBOARD_VISIBLE_THRESHOLD_DP)

    activityRoot.getWindowVisibleDisplayFrame(r)

    val heightDiff = activityRoot.rootView.height - r.height()

    return heightDiff > visibleThreshold;
}

fun Activity.getActivityRoot(): View {
    return (findViewById<ViewGroup>(android.R.id.content)).getChildAt(0);
}


Where UiUtils.KEYBOARD_VISIBLE_THRESHOLD_DP = 100 and dip() is an anko func that convert dpToPx:

fun dip(value: Int): Int {
    return (value * Resources.getSystem().displayMetrics.density).toInt()
}There's finally a direct way starting from Android R based on Kotlin now.
 val imeInsets = requireView().rootWindowInsets.isVisible(WindowsInsetsCompat.Type.ime()) 
    if (imeInsets) { 
     //Ime is visible
     //Lets move our view by the height of the IME
     view.translationX = imeInsets.bottom }I did this by setting a GlobalLayoutListener, as follows:

final View activityRootView = findViewById(R.id.activityRoot);
activityRootView.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(
        new OnGlobalLayoutListener() {
            @Override
            public void onGlobalLayout() {
                int heightView = activityRootView.getHeight();
                int widthView = activityRootView.getWidth();
                if (1.0 * widthView / heightView > 3) {
                    //Make changes for Keyboard not visible
                } else {
                    //Make changes for keyboard visible
                }
            }
        });Try this code it's really working if KeyboardShown is Shown then this function return true value....

private final String TAG = ""TextEditor"";
private TextView mTextEditor;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_editor);
    mTextEditor = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.text_editor);
    mTextEditor.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {
        @Override
        public void onGlobalLayout() {
            isKeyboardShown(mTextEditor.getRootView());
        }
    });
}

private boolean isKeyboardShown(View rootView) {
    /* 128dp = 32dp * 4, minimum button height 32dp and generic 4 rows soft keyboard */
    final int SOFT_KEYBOARD_HEIGHT_DP_THRESHOLD = 128;

    Rect r = new Rect();
    rootView.getWindowVisibleDisplayFrame(r);
    DisplayMetrics dm = rootView.getResources().getDisplayMetrics();
    /* heightDiff = rootView height - status bar height (r.top) - visible frame height (r.bottom - r.top) */
    int heightDiff = rootView.getBottom() - r.bottom;
    /* Threshold size: dp to pixels, multiply with display density */
    boolean isKeyboardShown = heightDiff > SOFT_KEYBOARD_HEIGHT_DP_THRESHOLD * dm.density;

    Log.d(TAG, ""isKeyboardShown ? "" + isKeyboardShown + "", heightDiff:"" + heightDiff + "", density:"" + dm.density
            + ""root view height:"" + rootView.getHeight() + "", rect:"" + r);

    return isKeyboardShown;
}As you might know android Software keyboard will be visible only when there is a possible event of typing. In other words Keyboard get visible only when EditText is focused. that means you can get weather the Keyboard is visible or not by using OnFocusChangeListener.

//Declare this Globally

public boolean isKeyBoardVisible = false;

//In OnCreate *[For Activity]*, OnCreateView *[For Fragment]*

text_send.setOnFocusChangeListener(new View.OnFocusChangeListener() {

    @Override
    public void onFocusChange(View v, boolean hasFocus) {
        if(hasFocus)
            isKeyBoardVisible = true;
        else
            isKeyBoardVisible = false;
    }
});


Now you can use isKeyBoardVisible variable anywhere in the class to get weather the keyboard is Open or Not. It worked well for me.

Note: This process doesn't work when the Keyboard is opened programmatically using InputMethodManager because that doesn't invoke OnFocusChangeListener.In my case i had only one EditText to manage in my layout so i came up whit this solution.
It works well, basically it is a custom EditText which listens for focus and sends a local broadcast if the focus changes or if the back/done button is pressed.
To work you need to place a dummy View in your layout with android:focusable=""true"" and android:focusableInTouchMode=""true"" because when you call clearFocus() the focus will be reassigned to the first focusable view.
Example of dummy view:

<View
android:layout_width=""1dp""
android:layout_height=""1dp""
android:focusable=""true""
android:focusableInTouchMode=""true""/>


Additional infos

The solution which detects the difference in layout changes doesn't work very well because it strongly depends on screen density, since 100px can be a lot in a certain device and nothing in some others you could get false positives.
Also different vendors have different keyboards.A little bit more compacted Kotlin version based on the answer of @bohdan-oliynyk
private const val KEYBOARD_VISIBLE_THRESHOLD_DP = 100

fun Activity.isKeyboardOpen(): Boolean {
    fun convertDpToPx(value: Int): Int =
        (value * Resources.getSystem().displayMetrics.density).toInt()

    val rootView = findViewById<View>(android.R.id.content)
    val visibleThreshold = Rect()
    rootView.getWindowVisibleDisplayFrame(visibleThreshold)
    val heightDiff = rootView.height - visibleThreshold.height()

    val accessibleValue = convertDpToPx(KEYBOARD_VISIBLE_THRESHOLD_DP)

    return heightDiff > accessibleValue
}

fun Activity.isKeyboardClosed(): Boolean {
    return isKeyboardOpen().not()
}In Android you can detect through ADB shell. I wrote and use this method:

{
        JSch jsch = new JSch();
        try {
            Session session = jsch.getSession(""<userName>"", ""<IP>"", 22);
            session.setPassword(""<Password>"");
            Properties config = new Properties();
            config.put(""StrictHostKeyChecking"", ""no"");
            session.setConfig(config);
            session.connect();

            ChannelExec channel = (ChannelExec)session.openChannel(""exec"");
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new    
            InputStreamReader(channel.getInputStream()));
            channel.setCommand(""C:/Android/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb shell dumpsys window 
            InputMethod | findstr \""mHasSurface\"""");
            channel.connect();

            String msg = null;
            String msg2 = "" mHasSurface=true"";

            while ((msg = in.readLine()) != null) {
                Boolean isContain = msg.contains(msg2);
                log.info(isContain);
                if (isContain){
                    log.info(""Hiding keyboard..."");
                    driver.hideKeyboard();
                }
                else {
                    log.info(""No need to hide keyboard."");
                }
            }

            channel.disconnect();
            session.disconnect();

        } catch (JSchException | IOException | InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

            }
        }
});Answer of @iWantScala is great but not working for me

rootView.getRootView().getHeight() always has the same value

one way is to define two vars

private int maxRootViewHeight = 0;
private int currentRootViewHeight = 0;


add global listener

rootView.getViewTreeObserver()
    .addOnGlobalLayoutListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {
        @Override
        public void onGlobalLayout() {
            currentRootViewHeight = rootView.getHeight();
            if (currentRootViewHeight > maxRootViewHeight) {
                maxRootViewHeight = currentRootViewHeight;
            }
        }
    });


then check

if (currentRootViewHeight >= maxRootViewHeight) {
    // Keyboard is hidden
} else {
    // Keyboard is shown
}


works fineThanks all answers, I figure it out for my own circumstances
/**

}private fun isKeyboardVisible(rootView: View) =
    ViewCompat.getRootWindowInsets(rootView)!!.isVisible(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime())I had a similar problem. I needed to react to the Enter button on screen (which hid the keyboard). In this case you can subscribe to the OnEditorAction of the text view the keyboard was opend with - if you have multiple editable boxes, then subscribe to all of them.

In your Activity you have full control of the keyboard, so at no point will you face the problem whether the keyboard is opened or not, if you listen to all opening and closing events.There is a direct method to find this out. And, it does not require the layout changes.

So it works in immersive fullscreen mode, too.

But, unfortunately, it does not work on all devices. So you have to test it with your device(s).



The trick is that you try to hide or show the soft keyboard and capture the result of that try.

If it works correct then the keyboard is not really shown or hidden. We just ask for the state.



To stay up-to-date, you simply repeat this operation, e.g. every 200 milliseconds, using a Handler.



The implementation below does just a single check.

If you do multiple checks, then you should enable all the (_keyboardVisible) tests.

public interface OnKeyboardShowHide
{
    void    onShowKeyboard( Object param );
    void    onHideKeyboard( Object param );
}

private static Handler      _keyboardHandler    = new Handler();
private boolean             _keyboardVisible    = false;
private OnKeyboardShowHide  _keyboardCallback;
private Object              _keyboardCallbackParam;

public void start( OnKeyboardShowHide callback, Object callbackParam )
{
    _keyboardCallback      = callback;
    _keyboardCallbackParam = callbackParam;
    //
    View view = getCurrentFocus();
    if (view != null)
    {
        InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getSystemService( Activity.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE );
        imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow( view.getWindowToken(), InputMethodManager.HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY, _keyboardResultReceiver );
        imm.showSoftInput( view, InputMethodManager.SHOW_IMPLICIT, _keyboardResultReceiver );
    }
    else // if (_keyboardVisible)
    {
        _keyboardVisible = false;
        _keyboardCallback.onHideKeyboard( _keyboardCallbackParam );
    }
}

private ResultReceiver      _keyboardResultReceiver = new ResultReceiver( _keyboardHandler )
{
    @Override
    protected void onReceiveResult( int resultCode, Bundle resultData )
    {
        switch (resultCode)
        {
            case InputMethodManager.RESULT_SHOWN :
            case InputMethodManager.RESULT_UNCHANGED_SHOWN :
                // if (!_keyboardVisible)
                {
                    _keyboardVisible = true;
                    _keyboardCallback.onShowKeyboard( _keyboardCallbackParam );
                }
                break;
            case InputMethodManager.RESULT_HIDDEN :
            case InputMethodManager.RESULT_UNCHANGED_HIDDEN :
                // if (_keyboardVisible)
                {
                    _keyboardVisible = false;
                    _keyboardCallback.onHideKeyboard( _keyboardCallbackParam );
                }
                break;
        }
    }
};Here is a workaround to know if softkeyboard is visible.


Check for running services on the system using ActivityManager.getRunningServices(max_count_of_services);
From the returned ActivityManager.RunningServiceInfo instances, check clientCount value for soft keyboard service.
The aforementioned  clientCount will be incremented every time, the soft keyboard is shown. For example, if clientCount was initially 1, it would be 2 when the keyboard is shown.
On keyboard dismissal, clientCount is decremented. In this case, it resets to 1.


Some of the popular keyboards have certain keywords in their classNames: 


Google AOSP = IME
Swype = IME
Swiftkey = KeyboardService
Fleksy = keyboard
Adaptxt = IME (KPTAdaptxtIME)
Smart = Keyboard (SmartKeyboard)


From ActivityManager.RunningServiceInfo, check for the above patterns in ClassNames.
Also, ActivityManager.RunningServiceInfo's clientPackage=android, indicating that the keyboard is bound to system.

The above mentioned information could be combined for a strict way to find out if soft keyboard is visible.I converted the answer to the kotlin, hope this helps for kotlin users.    

private fun checkKeyboardVisibility() {
    var isKeyboardShowing = false

    binding.coordinator.viewTreeObserver.addOnGlobalLayoutListener {
        val r = Rect()
        binding.coordinator.getWindowVisibleDisplayFrame(r)
        val screenHeight = binding.coordinator.rootView.height

        // r.bottom is the position above soft keypad or device button.
        // if keypad is shown, the r.bottom is smaller than that before.
        val keypadHeight = screenHeight - r.bottom


        if (keypadHeight > screenHeight * 0.15) { // 0.15 ratio is perhaps enough to determine keypad height.
            // keyboard is opened
            if (!isKeyboardShowing) {
                isKeyboardShowing = true

            }
        } else {
            // keyboard is closed
            if (isKeyboardShowing) {
                isKeyboardShowing = false

            }

}If you support apis for AndroidR in your app then you can use the below method. 

In kotlin :
    var imeInsets = view.rootWindowInsets.getInsets(Type.ime()) 
    if (imeInsets.isVisible) {

How do I install pip on Windows?,"Python 2.7.9+ and 3.4+

Good news! Python 3.4 (released March 2014) and Python 2.7.9 (released December 2014) ship with Pip. This is the best feature of any Python release. It makes the community's wealth of libraries accessible to everyone. Newbies are no longer excluded from using community libraries by the prohibitive difficulty of setup. In shipping with a package manager, Python joins Ruby, Node.js, Haskell, Perl, Go—almost every other contemporary language with a majority open-source community. Thank you, Python.

If you do find that pip is not available when using Python 3.4+ or Python 2.7.9+, simply execute e.g.:

py -3 -m ensurepip


Of course, that doesn't mean Python packaging is problem solved. The experience remains frustrating. I discuss this in the Stack Overflow question Does Python have a package/module management system?.

And, alas for everyone using Python 2.7.8 or earlier (a sizable portion of the community). There's no plan to ship Pip to you. Manual instructions follow.

Python 2 ≤ 2.7.8 and Python 3 ≤ 3.3

Flying in the face of its 'batteries included' motto, Python ships without a package manager. To make matters worse, Pip was—until recently—ironically difficult to install.

Official instructions

Per https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip:

Download get-pip.py, being careful to save it as a .py file rather than .txt. Then, run it from the command prompt:

python get-pip.py


You possibly need an administrator command prompt to do this. Follow Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator (Microsoft TechNet).

This installs the pip package, which (in Windows) contains ...\Scripts\pip.exe that path must be in PATH environment variable to use pip from the command line (see the second part of 'Alternative Instructions' for adding it to your PATH,

Alternative instructions

The official documentation tells users to install Pip and each of its dependencies from source. That's tedious for the experienced and prohibitively difficult for newbies.

For our sake, Christoph Gohlke prepares Windows installers (.msi) for popular Python packages. He builds installers for all Python versions, both 32 and 64 bit. You need to:


Install setuptools
Install pip


For me, this installed Pip at C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe. Find pip.exe on your computer, then add its folder (for example, C:\Python27\Scripts) to your path (Start / Edit environment variables). Now you should be able to run pip from the command line. Try installing a package:

pip install httpie


There you go (hopefully)! Solutions for common problems are given below:

Proxy problems

If you work in an office, you might be behind an HTTP proxy. If so, set the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy. Most Python applications (and other free software) respect these. Example syntax:

http://proxy_url:port
http://username:password@proxy_url:port


If you're really unlucky, your proxy might be a Microsoft NTLM proxy. Free software can't cope. The only solution is to install a free software friendly proxy that forwards to the nasty proxy. http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/

Unable to find vcvarsall.bat

Python modules can be partly written in C or C++. Pip tries to compile from source. If you don't have a C/C++ compiler installed and configured, you'll see this cryptic error message.


  Error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat


You can fix that by installing a C++ compiler such as MinGW or Visual C++. Microsoft actually ships one specifically for use with Python. Or try Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7.

Often though it's easier to check Christoph's site for your package.-- Outdated -- use distribute, not setuptools as described here. --

-- Outdated #2 -- use setuptools as distribute is deprecated.

As you mentioned pip doesn't include an independent installer, but you can install it with its predecessor easy_install.

So:


Download the last pip version from here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip#downloads
Uncompress it
Download the last easy installer for Windows: (download the .exe at the bottom of http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools ). Install it.
copy the uncompressed pip folder content into C:\Python2x\ folder (don't copy the whole folder into it, just the content), because python command doesn't work outside C:\Python2x folder and then run:  python setup.py install
Add your python C:\Python2x\Scripts to the path


You are done. 

Now you can use pip install package to easily install packages as in Linux :)2014 UPDATE:

1) If you have installed Python 3.4 or later, pip is included with Python and should already be working on your system.

2) If you are running a version below Python 3.4 or if pip was not installed with Python 3.4 for some reason, then you'd probably use pip's official installation script get-pip.py. The pip installer now grabs setuptools for you, and works regardless of architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

The installation instructions are detailed here and involve:


  To install or upgrade pip, securely download get-pip.py.
  
  Then run the following (which may require administrator access):


python get-pip.py



  To upgrade an existing setuptools (or distribute), run pip install -U setuptools


I'll leave the two sets of old instructions below for posterity.

OLD Answers:

For Windows editions of the 64 bit variety - 64-bit Windows + Python used to require a separate installation method due to ez_setup, but I've tested the new distribute method on 64-bit Windows running 32-bit Python and 64-bit Python, and you can now use the same method for all versions of Windows/Python 2.7X:

OLD Method 2 using distribute:


Download distribute - I threw mine in C:\Python27\Scripts (feel free to create a Scripts directory if it doesn't exist.
Open up a command prompt (on Windows you should check out conemu2 if you don't use PowerShell) and change (cd) to the directory you've downloaded distribute_setup.py to.
Run distribute_setup: python distribute_setup.py (This will not work if your python installation directory is not added to your path - go here for help)
Change the current directory to the Scripts directory for your Python installation (C:\Python27\Scripts) or add that directory, as well as the Python base installation directory to your %PATH% environment variable.
Install pip using the newly installed setuptools: easy_install pip


The last step will not work unless you're either in the directory easy_install.exe is located in (C:\Python27\Scripts would be the default for Python 2.7), or you have that directory added to your path.

OLD Method 1 using ez_setup:

from the setuptools page --


  Download ez_setup.py and run it; it will download the appropriate .egg file and install it for you. (Currently, the provided .exe installer does not support 64-bit versions of Python for Windows, due to a distutils installer compatibility issue.


After this, you may continue with:


Add c:\Python2x\Scripts to the Windows path (replace the x in Python2x with the actual version number you have installed)
Open a new (!) DOS prompt. From there run easy_install pip2016+ Update: 

These answers are outdated or otherwise wordy and difficult.

If you've got Python 3.4+ or 2.7.9+, it will be installed by default on Windows.  Otherwise, in short:


Download the pip installer: 
https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
If paranoid, inspect file to confirm it isn't malicious
(must b64 decode).
Open a console in the download folder as Admin and run
get-pip.py.  Alternatively, right-click its icon in Explorer and choose the ""run as Admin..."".


The new binaries pip.exe (and the deprecated easy_install.exe) will be found in the ""%ProgramFiles%\PythonXX\Scripts"" folder (or similar), which is often not in your PATH variable.  I recommend adding it.Python 3.4, which  was released in March 2014, comes with pip included:

http://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/3.4.html

So, since the release of Python 3.4, the up-to-date way to install pip on Windows is to just install Python.

The recommended way to use it is to call it as a module, especially with multiple python distributions or versions installed, to guarantee packages go to the correct place:

python -m pip install --upgrade packageXYZ

https://docs.python.org/3/installing/#work-with-multiple-versions-of-python-installed-in-parallelWhen I have to use Windows, I use ActivePython, which automatically adds everything to your PATH and includes a package manager called PyPM which provides binary package management making it faster and simpler to install packages.

pip and easy_install aren't exactly the same thing, so there are some things you can get through pip but not easy_install and vice versa.

My recommendation is that you get ActivePython Community Edition and don't worry about the huge hassle of getting everything set up for Python on Windows. Then, you can just use pypm.

In case you want to use pip you have to check the PyPM option in the ActiveState installer. After installation you only need to logoff and log on again, and pip will be available on the commandline, because it is contained in the ActiveState installer PyPM option and the paths have been set by the installer for you already. PyPM will also be available, but you do not have to use it.The up-to-date way is to use Windows' package manager Chocolatey.

Once this is installed, all you have to do is open a command prompt and run the following the three commands below, which will install Python 2.7, easy_install and pip. It will automatically detect whether you're on x64 or x86 Windows.

cinst python
cinst easy.install
cinst pip


All of the other Python packages on the Chocolatey Gallery can be found here.Update March 2015

Python 2.7.9 and later (on the Python 2 series), and Python 3.4 and later include pip by default, so you may have pip already.

If you don't, run this one line command on your prompt (which may require administrator access):

python -c ""exec('try: from urllib2 import urlopen \nexcept: from urllib.request import urlopen');f=urlopen('https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py').read();exec(f)""


It will install pip. If Setuptools is not already installed, get-pip.py will install it for you too.

As mentioned in comments, the above command will download code from the Pip source code repository at GitHub, and dynamically run it at your environment. So be noticed that this is a shortcut of the steps download, inspect and run, all with a single command using Python itself. If you trust Pip, proceed without doubt.

Be sure that your Windows environment variable PATH includes Python's folders (for Python 2.7.x default install: C:\Python27 and C:\Python27\Scripts, for Python 3.3x: C:\Python33 and C:\Python33\Scripts, and so on).Installers

I've built Windows installers for both distribute and pip here (the goal being to use pip without having to either bootstrap with easy_install or save and run Python scripts):


distribute-0.6.27.win32.exe
pip-1.1.win32.exe


On Windows, simply download and install first distribute, then pip from the above links. The distribute link above does contain stub .exe installers, and these are currently 32-bit only. I haven't tested the effect on 64-bit Windows.

Building on Windows

The process to redo this for new versions is not difficult, and I've included it here for reference.

Building distribute

In order to get the stub .exe files, you need to have a Visual C++ compiler (it is apparently compilable with MinGW as well)

hg clone https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute
cd distribute
hg checkout 0.6.27
rem optionally, comment out tag_build and tag_svn_revision in setup.cfg
msvc-build-launcher.cmd
python setup.py bdist_win32
cd ..
echo build is in distribute\dist


Building pip

git clone https://github.com/pypa/pip.git
cd pip
git checkout 1.1
python setup.py bdist_win32
cd ..
echo build is in pip\distTo install pip globally on Python 2.x, easy_install appears to be the best solution as Adrián states.

However the installation instructions for pip recommend using virtualenv since every virtualenv has pip installed in it automatically.  This does not require root access or modify your system Python installation.

Installing virtualenv still requires easy_install though.

2018 update: 

Python 3.3+ now includes the venv module for easily creating virtual environments like so:

python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

See documentation for different platform methods of activating the environment after creation, but typically one of:

$ source <venv>/bin/activate 

C:\> <venv>\Scripts\activate.batTo use pip, it is not mandatory that you need to install pip in the system directly. You can use it through virtualenv. What you can do is follow these steps:


Download virtualenv tar.gz file from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
Unzip it with 7zip or some other tool


We normally need to install Python packages for one particular project. So, now create a project folder, let’s say myproject.


Copy the virtualenv.py file from the decompressed folder of virtualenv, and paste inside the myproject folder


Now create a virtual environment, let’s say myvirtualenv as follows, inside the myproject folder:

python virtualenv.py myvirtualenv


It will show you:

New python executable in myvirtualenv\Scripts\python.exe
Installing setuptools....................................done.
Installing pip.........................done.


Now your virtual environment, myvirtualenv, is created inside your project folder. You might notice, pip is now installed inside you virtual environment. All you need to do is activate the virtual environment with the following command.

myvirtualenv\Scripts\activate


You will see the following at the command prompt:

(myvirtualenv) PATH\TO\YOUR\PROJECT\FOLDER>pip install package_name


Now you can start using pip, but make sure you have activated the virtualenv looking at the left of your prompt.

This is one of the easiest way to install pip i.e. inside virtual environment, but you need to have virtualenv.py file with you.

For more ways to install pip/virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper, you can refer to thegauraw.tumblr.com.Updated at 2016 : Pip should already be included in Python 2.7.9+ or 3.4+, but if for whatever reason it is not there, you can use the following one-liner.


Download https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and run it with Administrator permission python get-pip.py (If you are on Linux, use sudo python get-pip.py)


PS:


This should already be satisfied in most cases but, if necessary, be sure that your environment variable PATH includes Python's folders (for example, Python 2.7.x on Windows default install: C:\Python27 and C:\Python27\Scripts, for Python 3.3x: C:\Python33 and C:\Python33\Scripts, etc)
I encounter same problem and then found such perhaps easiest way (one liner!) mentioned on official website here: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html


Can't believe there are so many lengthy (perhaps outdated?) answers out there. Feeling thankful to them but, please up-vote this short answer to help more new comers!I just wanted to add one more solution for those having issues installing setuptools from Windows 64-bit. The issue is discussed in this bug on python.org and is still unresolved as of the date of this comment. A simple workaround is mentioned and it works flawlessly. One registry change did the trick for me.

Link: http://bugs.python.org/issue6792#

Solution that worked for me...:

Add this registry setting for 2.6+ versions of Python:

 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Python\PythonCore\2.6\InstallPath]
 @=""C:\\Python26\\""


This is most likely the registry setting you will already have for Python 2.6+:

 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\2.6\InstallPath]
 @=""C:\\Python26\\""


Clearly, you will need to replace the 2.6 version with whatever version of Python you are running.The best way I found so far, is just two lines of code:

curl http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py | python
curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python


It was tested on Windows 8 with PowerShell, Cmd, and Git Bash (MinGW).

And you probably want to add the path to your environment. It's somewhere like C:\Python33\Scripts.PythonXY comes with pip included, among others.I had some issues installing in different ways when I followed instructions here. I think it's very tricky to install in every Windows environment in the same way. In my case I need Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 in the same machine for different purposes so that's why I think there're more problems.
But the following instructions worked perfectly for me, so might be depending on your environment you should try this one:

http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/

Also, due to the different environments I found incredible useful to use Virtual Environments, I had websites that use different libraries and it's much better to encapsulate them into a single folder, check out the instructions, briefly if PIP is installed you just install VirtualEnv:

pip install virtualenv


Into the folder you have all your files run

virtualenv venv


And seconds later you have a virtual environment with everything in venv folder, to activate it run venv/Scripts/activate.bat (deactivate the environment is easy, use deactivate.bat). Every library you install will end up in venv\Lib\site-packages and it's easy to move your whole environment somewhere.

The only downside I found is some code editors can't recognize this kind of environments, and you will see warnings in your code because imported libraries are not found. Of course there're tricky ways to do it but it would be nice editors keep in mind Virtual Environments are very normal nowadays.

Hope it helps.It's very simple:

Step 1: wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
Step 2: wget https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
Step 2: python ez_setup.py
Step 3: python get-pip.py

If we distribute the .py files or even .pyc files it will be easy to (decompile and) remove the code that checks the license file. Another aspect is that my employer does not want the code to be read by our customers, fearing that the code may be stolen or at least the ""novel ideas"". Is there a good way to handle this problem?""Is there a good way to handle this problem?""  No.  Nothing can be protected against reverse engineering.  Even the firmware on DVD machines has been reverse engineered and the AACS Encryption key exposed.  And that's in spite of the DMCA making that a criminal offense.
Since no technical method can stop your customers from reading your code, you have to apply ordinary commercial methods.

Licenses.  Contracts.  Terms and Conditions.  This still works even when people can read the code.  Note that some of your Python-based components may require that you pay fees before you sell software using those components.  Also, some open-source licenses prohibit you from concealing the source or origins of that component.

Offer significant value.  If your stuff is so good -- at a price that is hard to refuse -- there's no incentive to waste time and money reverse engineering anything.  Reverse engineering is expensive.  Make your product slightly less expensive.

Offer upgrades and enhancements that make any reverse engineering a bad idea.  When the next release breaks their reverse engineering, there's no point.  This can be carried to absurd extremes, but you should offer new features that make the next release more valuable than reverse engineering.

Offer customization at rates so attractive that they'd rather pay you to build and support the enhancements.

Use a license key which expires.  This is cruel, and will give you a bad reputation, but it certainly makes your software stop working.

Offer it as a web service.  SaaS involves no downloads to customers.Python, being a byte-code-compiled interpreted language, is very difficult to lock down.  Even if you use a exe-packager like py2exe, the layout of the executable is well-known, and the Python byte-codes are well understood.

Usually in cases like this, you have to make a tradeoff.  How important is it really to protect the code?  Are there real secrets in there (such as a key for symmetric encryption of bank transfers), or are you just being paranoid?  Choose the language that lets you develop the best product quickest, and be realistic about how valuable your novel ideas are.

If you decide you really need to enforce the license check securely, write it as a small C extension so that the license check code can be extra-hard (but not impossible!) to reverse engineer, and leave the bulk of your code in Python.Python is not the tool you need

You must use the right tool to do the right thing, and Python was not designed to be obfuscated. It's the contrary; everything is open or easy to reveal or modify in Python because that's the language's philosophy.

If you want something you can't see through, look for another tool. This is not a bad thing, it is important that several different tools exist for different usages.

Obfuscation is really hard

Even compiled programs can be reverse-engineered so don't think that you can fully protect any code. You can analyze obfuscated PHP, break the flash encryption key, etc. Newer versions of Windows are cracked every time.

Having a legal requirement is a good way to go

You cannot prevent somebody from misusing your code, but you can easily discover if someone does. Therefore, it's just a casual legal issue.

Code protection is overrated

Nowadays, business models tend to go for selling services instead of products. You cannot copy a service, pirate nor steal it. Maybe it's time to consider to go with the flow...Compile python and distribute binaries!

Sensible idea: 

Use Cython, Nuitka, Shed Skin or something similar to compile python to C code, then distribute your app as python binary libraries (pyd) instead.

That way, no Python (byte) code is left and you've done any reasonable amount of obscurification anyone (i.e. your employer) could expect from regular Code, I think. (.NET or Java less safe than this case, as that bytecode is not obfuscated and can relatively easily be decompiled into reasonable source.)

Cython is getting more and more compatible with CPython, so I think it should work. (I'm actually considering this for our product.. We're already building some thirdparty libs as pyd/dlls, so shipping our own python code as binaries is not a overly big step for us.)

See This Blog Post (not by me) for a tutorial on how to do it. (thx @hithwen)

Crazy idea:

You could probably get Cython to store the C-files separately for each module, then just concatenate them all and build them with heavy inlining. That way, your Python module is pretty monolithic and difficult to chip at with common tools.

Beyond crazy:

You might be able to build a single executable if you can link to (and optimize with) the python runtime and all libraries (dlls) statically. That way, it'd sure be difficult to intercept calls to/from python and whatever framework libraries you use. This cannot be done if you're using LGPL code though.I understand that you want your customers to use the power of python but do not want expose the source code.

Here are my suggestions:

(a) Write the critical pieces of the code as C or C++ libraries and then use SIP or swig to expose the C/C++ APIs to Python namespace.

(b) Use cython instead of Python

(c) In both (a) and (b), it should be possible to distribute the libraries as licensed binary with a Python interface.Have you had a look at pyminifier? It does Minify, obfuscate, and compress Python code. The example code looks pretty nasty for casual reverse engineering.

# Created by pyminifier (https://github.com/liftoff/pyminifier)Is your employer aware that he can ""steal"" back any ideas that other people get from your code? I mean, if they can read your work, so can you theirs. Maybe looking at how you can benefit from the situation would yield a better return of your investment than fearing how much you could lose.

[EDIT] Answer to Nick's comment:

Nothing gained and nothing lost. The customer has what he wants (and paid for it since he did the change himself). Since he doesn't release the change, it's as if it didn't happen for everyone else.

Now if the customer sells the software, they have to change the copyright notice (which is illegal, so you can sue and will win -> simple case).

If they don't change the copyright notice, the 2nd level customers will notice that the software comes from you original and wonder what is going on. Chances are that they will contact you and so you will learn about the reselling of your work.

Again we have two cases: The original customer sold only a few copies. That means they didn't make much money anyway, so why bother. Or they sold in volume. That means better chances for you to learn about what they do and do something about it.

But in the end, most companies try to comply to the law (once their reputation is ruined, it's much harder to do business). So they will not steal your work but work with you to improve it. So if you include the source (with a license that protects you from simple reselling), chances are that they will simply push back changes they made since that will make sure the change is in the next version and they don't have to maintain it. That's win-win: You get changes and they can make the change themselves if they really, desperately need it even if you're unwilling to include it in the official release.Use Cython. It will compile your modules to high-performant C files, which can then be compiled to native binary libraries. This is basically un-reversable, compared to .pyc bytecode!

I've written a detailed article on how to set up Cython for a Python project, check it out:

Protecting Python Sources With CythonDo not rely on obfuscation. As You have correctly concluded, it offers very limited protection.
UPDATE: Here is a link to paper which reverse engineered obfuscated python code in Dropbox. The approach - opcode remapping is a good barrier, but clearly it can be defeated.

Instead, as many posters have mentioned make it:


Not worth reverse engineering time (Your software is so good, it makes sense to pay)
Make them sign a contract and do a license audit if feasible. 


Alternatively, as the kick-ass Python IDE WingIDE does: Give away the code. That's right, give the code away and have people come back for upgrades and support.Shipping .pyc files has its problems - they are not compatible with any other python version than the python version they were created with, which means you must know which python version is running on the systems the product will run on. That's a very limiting factor.In some circumstances, it may be possible to move (all, or at least a key part) of the software into a web service that your organization hosts.

That way, the license checks can be performed in the safety of your own server room.I was surprised in not seeing pyconcrete in any answer. Maybe because it's newer than the question?

It could be exactly what you need(ed).

Instead of obfuscating the code, it encrypts it and decrypts at load time.

From pypi page:


  Protect python script work flow 
  
  
  your_script.py import pyconcrete
  pyconcrete will hook import module 
  when your script do import MODULE,
  pyconcrete import hook will try to find MODULE.pye first and then
  decrypt MODULE.pye via _pyconcrete.pyd and execute decrypted data (as
  .pyc content) 
  encrypt & decrypt secret key record in _pyconcrete.pyd
  (like DLL or SO) the secret key would be hide in binary code, can’t
  see it directly in HEX viewI think there is one more method to protect your Python code; part of the Obfuscation method. I believe there was a game like Mount and Blade or something that changed and recompiled their own python interpreter (the original interpreter which i believe is open source) and just changed the OP codes in the OP code table to be different then the standard python OP codes.

So the python source is unmodified but the file extensions of the *.pyc files are different and the op codes don't match to the public python.exe interpreter. If you checked the games data files all the data was in Python source format.

All sorts of nasty tricks can be done to mess with immature hackers this way. Stopping a bunch of inexperienced hackers is easy. It's the professional hackers that you will not likely beat. But most companies don't keep pro hackers on staff long I imagine (likely because things get hacked). But immature hackers are all over the place (read as curious IT staff).

You could for example, in a modified interpreter, allow it to check for certain comments or doc strings in your source. You could have special OP codes for such lines of code. For example:

OP 234 is for source line ""# Copyright I wrote this""
or compile that line into op codes that are equivalent to ""if False:"" if ""# Copyright"" is missing. Basically disabling a whole block of code for what appears to be some obscure reason.

One use case where recompiling a modified interpreter may be feasible is where you didn't write the app, the app is big, but you are paid to protect it, such as when you're a dedicated server admin for a financial app.

I find it a little contradictory to leave the source or opcodes open for eyeballs, but use SSL for network traffic. SSL is not 100% safe either. But it's used to stop MOST eyes from reading it. A wee bit precaution is sensible.

Also, if enough people deem that Python source and opcodes are too visible, it's likely someone will eventually develop at least a simple protection tool for it. So the more people asking ""how to protect Python app"" only promotes that development.The reliable only way to protect code is to run it on a server you control and provide your clients with a client which interfaces with that server.Depending in who the client is, a simple protection mechanism, combined with a sensible license agreement will be far more effective than any complex licensing/encryption/obfuscation system.

The best solution would be selling the code as a service, say by hosting the service, or offering support - although that isn't always practical.

Shipping the code as .pyc files will prevent your protection being foiled by a few #s, but it's hardly effective anti-piracy protection (as if there is such a technology), and at the end of the day, it shouldn't achieve anything that a decent license agreement with the company will.

Concentrate on making your code as nice to use as possible - having happy customers will make your company far more money than preventing some theoretical piracy..Another attempt to make your code harder to steal is to use jython and then use java obfuscator. 

This should work pretty well as jythonc translate python code to java and then java is compiled to bytecode. So ounce you obfuscate the classes it will be really hard to understand what is going on after decompilation, not to mention recovering the actual code. 

The only problem with jython is that you can't use python modules written in c.What about signing your code with standard encryption schemes by hashing and signing important files and checking it with public key methods?

In this way you can issue license file with a public key for each customer.

Additional you can use an python obfuscator like this one (just googled it).You should take a look at how the guys at getdropbox.com do it for their client software, including Linux. It's quite tricky to crack and requires some quite creative disassembly to get past the protection mechanisms.The best you can do with Python is to obscure things.


Strip out all docstrings
Distribute only the .pyc compiled files.
freeze it
Obscure your constants inside a class/module so that help(config) doesn't show everything


You may be able to add some additional obscurity by encrypting part of it and decrypting it on the fly and passing it to eval(). But no matter what you do someone can break it.

None of this will stop a determined attacker from disassembling the bytecode or digging through your api with help, dir, etc.Idea of having time restricted license and check for it in locally installed program will not work. Even with perfect obfuscation, license check can be removed. However if you check license on remote system and run significant part of the program on your closed remote system, you will be able to protect your IP.

Preventing competitors from using the source code as their own or write their inspired version of the same code, one way to protect is to add signatures to your program logic (some secrets to be able to prove that code was stolen from you) and obfuscate the python source code so, it's hard to read and utilize. 

Good obfuscation adds basically the same protection to your code, that compiling it to executable (and stripping binary) does. Figuring out how obfuscated complex code works might be even harder than actually writing your own implementation. 

This will not help preventing hacking of your program. Even with obfuscation code license stuff will be cracked and program may be modified to have slightly different behaviour (in the same way that compiling code to binary does not help protection of native programs). 

In addition to symbol obfuscation might be good idea to unrefactor the code, which makes everything even more confusing if e.g. call graphs points to many different places even if actually those different places does eventually the same thing. 

Logical signature inside obfuscated code (e.g. you may create table of values which are used by program logic, but also used as signature), which can be used to determine that code is originated from you. If someone decides to use your obfuscated code module as part of their own product (even after reobfuscating it to make it seem different) you can show, that code is stolen with your secret signature.I have looked at software protection in general for my own projects and the general philosophy is that complete protection is impossible.  The only thing that you can hope to achieve is to add protection to a level that would cost your customer more to bypass than it would to purchase another license.

With that said I was just checking google for python obsfucation and not turning up a lot of anything.  In a .Net solution, obsfucation would be a first approach to your problem on a windows platform, but I am not sure if anyone has solutions on Linux that work with Mono.  

The next thing would be to write your code in a compiled language, or if you really want to go all the way, then in assembler.  A stripped out executable would be a lot harder to decompile than an interpreted language.

It all comes down to tradeoffs.  On one end you have ease of software development in python, in which it is also very hard to hide secrets.  On the other end you have software written in assembler which is much harder to write, but is much easier to hide secrets.

Your boss has to choose a point somewhere along that continuum that supports his requirements.  And then he has to give you the tools and time so you can build what he wants.   However my bet is that he will object to real development costs versus potential monetary losses.It is possible to have the py2exe byte-code in a crypted resource for a C launcher that loads and executes it in memory. Some ideas here and here.

Some have also thought of a self modifying program to make reverse engineering expensive.

You can also find tutorials for preventing debuggers, make the disassembler fail, set false debugger breakpoints and protect your code with checksums. Search for [""crypted code""  execute ""in memory""] for more links.

But as others already said, if your code is worth it, reverse engineers will succeed in the end.Use the same way to protect binary file of c/c++, that is, obfuscate each function body in executable or library binary file, insert an instruction ""jump"" at the begin of each function entry, jump to special function to restore obfuscated code. Byte-code is binary code of Python script, so 


First compile python script to code object
Then iterate each code object, obfuscate co_code of each code object as the following


    0   JUMP_ABSOLUTE            n = 3 + len(bytecode)

    3
    ...
    ... Here it's obfuscated bytecode
    ...

    n   LOAD_GLOBAL              ? (__pyarmor__)
    n+3 CALL_FUNCTION            0
    n+6 POP_TOP
    n+7 JUMP_ABSOLUTE            0



Save obfuscated code object as .pyc or .pyo file


Those obfuscated file (.pyc or .pyo) can be used by normal python interpreter, when those code object is called first time


First op is JUMP_ABSOLUTE, it will jump to offset n
At offset n, the instruction is to call a PyCFunction. This function will restore those obfuscated bytecode between offset 3 and n, and put the original byte-code at offset 0. The obfuscated code can be got by the following code

    char *obfucated_bytecode;
    Py_ssize_t len;
    PyFrameObject* frame = PyEval_GetFrame();
    PyCodeObject *f_code = frame->f_code;
    PyObject *co_code = f_code->co_code;      
    PyBytes_AsStringAndSize(co_code, &obfucated_bytecode, &len)

After this function returns, the last instruction is to jump to
offset 0. The really byte-code now is executed.


There is a tool Pyarmor to obfuscate python scripts by this way.There is a comprehensive answer on concealing the python source code, which can be find here.

Possible techniques discussed are:

- use compiled bytecode (python -m compileall)

- executable creators (or installers like PyInstaller)

- software as an service (the best solution to conceal your code in my opinion)

- python source code obfuscatorsusing cxfreeze ( py2exe for linux ) will do the job.

There is an open-source library on GitHub that can help you with the license verification bit.

You can install it by pip install licensing and then add the following code:

if res[0] == None not Helpers.IsOnRightMachine(res[0]):
    print(""An error occured: {0}"".format(res[1]))
else:
    print(""Success"")


You can read more about the way the RSA public key, etc are configured here.Neiher Cython nor Nuitka were not the answer, because when running the solution that is compiled with Nuitka or Cython into .pyd or .exe files a cache directory is generated and all .pyc files are copied into the cache directory, so an attacker simply can decompile .pyc files and see your code or change it.Though there's no perfect solution, the following can be done:


Move some critical piece of startup code into a native library.
Enforce the license check in the native library.


If the call to the native code were to be removed, the program wouldn't start anyway. If it's not removed then the license will be enforced.

Though this is not a cross-platform or a pure-Python solution, it will work.",,,,,1,3795,51.39,50.42,19.66,28.69,22.06,23.35,80.45,62.58,50.14,11.52,5.4,0.74,0.24,3.43,0.24,0.74,6.11,13.52,6.35,1.24,11.49,9.67,4.35,6.8,1.61,15.97,6.19,3.58,2.61,0.42,1.37,0.84,17.5,0.84,16.6,3.06,2.77,2.29,3.64,0.58,5.32,0.05,2.61,1.58,0.95,0.92,0.32,0.53,0.08,0.05,0.16,0,8.33,2.58,0.26,0.03,0.11,0.13,1.21,5.74,0,0,0,0.29,1.66,0,0,1.66,6.46,0.21,0.08,5.45,1.19,0,0.21,0.08,0.03,0,0.03,0,0,0.03,0,0.61,0.24,0.5,0.05,0.11,0,0.16,1.11,0.74,4.8,6.67,0.71,1.08,3.74,1.26,0,0.18,2,1.63,5.77,1.82,0.45,0.45,0,0,0,22.21,6.27,3.56,0.24,0.11,1.37,10.67,
How do small software patches correct big software?,"One thing I've always wondered about is how software patches work. A lot of software seems to just release new versions on their binaries that need to be installed over older versions, but some software (operating systems like Windows in particular) seem to be able to release very small patches that correct bugs or add functionality to existing software. Most of the time the patches I see can't possibly replace entire applications, or even small files that are used within applications. To me it seems like the actual binary is being modified. How are these kinds of patches actually implemented? Could anyone point me to any resources that explain how this works, or is it just as simple as replacing small components such as linked libraries in an application? I'll probably never need to do a deployment in this manner, but I am curious to find out how it works. If I'm correct in my understanding that patches can really modify only portions of binary files, is this possible to do in .NET? If it is I'd like to learn it since that's the framework I'm most familiar with and I'd like to understand how it works.This is usually implemented using binary diff algorithms -- diff the most recently released version against the new code. If the user's running the most recent version, you only need to apply the diff. Works particularly well against software, because compiled code is usually pretty similar between versions. Of course, if the user's not running the most recent version you'll have to download the whole thing anyway.



There are a couple implementations of generic binary diff algorithms: bsdiff and xdelta are good open-source implementations. I can't find any implementations for .NET, but since the algorithms in question are pretty platform-agnostic it shouldn't be too difficult to port them if you feel like a project.If you are talking about patching windows applications then what you want to look at are .MSP files.  These are similar to an .MSI but just patch and application.

Take a look at Patching and Upgrading in the MSDN documents.

What an .MSP files does is load updated files to an application install.  This typically is updated dll's and resource files, but could include any file.

In addition to patching the installed application, the repair files located in C:\WINDOWS\Installer are updated as well.  Then if the user selects ""Repair"" from Add / Remove programs the updated patch files are used as well.

I'm thinking that the binary diff method discussed by John Millikin must be used in other operating systems.  Although you could make it work in windows it would be somewhat alien.",,,,,1,445,49.11,9.11,52.23,47.51,20.23,25.62,80.9,69.66,55.73,11.01,4.72,2.92,0,1.35,0,0.45,6.29,12.81,6.29,0.22,14.16,10.79,7.42,6.97,1.12,20.45,6.29,4.49,1.57,0,1.57,0,21.8,0.45,21.35,4.72,2.92,4.04,6.29,1.35,6.52,0,2.7,2.25,0.45,1.35,1.12,0.22,0,0,0,0,3.15,1.12,0,0,0,0,0.9,2.02,0,0,0,0,1.8,0,0,1.8,5.84,0,0.9,4.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.12,1.12,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0.45,5.17,5.62,0.45,0.45,3.82,0.67,0,0.22,4.04,1.35,8.09,0.9,0.22,0.22,0,0,0,14.83,5.84,2.47,0.67,0,3.37,2.47,

How does Software/Code actually communicate with Hardware?,"My question is: When I press the ""Shut down"" button in Windows/Linux,the computer shuts down. How did the command ""Shut down"" actually make the computer Physically shutdown? To make my point clear: When we kick a ball,there is physical contact between the ball and our leg,for the ball to move.So how is the physical connection achieved between software and hardware? How does plain text of codes make the computer do what it does?While the answer is fairly complex, and requires understanding the basics of electrical systems & circuits (KVL, KCL), binary numbers, and boolean logic, we can describe the process at a high level: code (represented by plain text words) is compiled, assembled and ultimately translated into a combination of Zeroes and Ones, which represent low and high voltages respectively.

When voltages are applied to materials & circuits, those voltages can change their physical properties, such as closing a circuit which supplies current to a light bulb (causing it to illuminate) or supplying current to a dc-motor which might open up a CD/DVD/Bluray/(?) Drive.

Now imagine a hypothetical 1-bit CPU, which has the ability to close a circuit and deliver current to a buzzer, making a sound. This 1-bit CPU has a single Input, which can have two values: 0 and 1.

This simple CPU has a very simple assembly language: ON and OFF, and we have a fancy programming language that provides some nicer abstractions: cpu.turnOn,cpu.turnOff.

I write my program cpu.turnOn; compile it, assemble it, and it's ready to be run. When I run the program on my CPU, the buzzer turns on.

In the real world, computers are made up of more complex systems. Instead of a single 1-bit CPU, we have 64-bit CPU, with complex instruction sets, and a myriad of devices. 

To make things for a complex system to interact, these systems are made up of layers of abstractions. 

The lowest layer is voltages, circuits and silicon, or what you might think of as the actual 'physical hardware.' Along side the hardware will typically sit a 'microcontroller' or a specialized processing unit that is designed to interact with the specifics of a hardware. Imagine an optical disk drive, it's microcontroller has the ability to eject the drive bay, start up the motor, align the laser, and stream data off disc.

The software that the microcontroller runs, is referred to as firmware. It's a specialized operating system that controls hardware functions and may also include an API. In the imaginary 1-bit CPU example, the program would be firmware, and the cpu.turnOn, cpu.turnOff would be the API.

Given a computer is made up of lots of hardware components (graphics, storage, communications, i/o), computers are made up of lots of specialized firmwares. For anything useful to get done with that hardware, another layer of abstraction is needed, for example to deal with Keyboards in a universal manner, or to allow mice, touchpads, and trackballs all to behave the same despite different interactions. This is where the Operating System comes in. The OS provides an API to manage groups of related devices, and provides hooks for hardware vendors to provide the translation between the OS commands, and the commands the microcontroller understand. In Windows land, this is a driver.

The next layer of abstraction above Operating Systems and Drivers, are applications, what users use to do real work (or play Fortnite). These programs are written in a myriad of languages, SDK, and toolkits, and is the reason why StackOverflow exists. Those languages compile down into executable code which the OS loads and manages, and executed by the computer.

Putting it all together with the shutdown command: the command interpreter uses an OS level API that manages system power. That API sends a notification to the rest of the OS to handle things like gracefully flushing memory buffers, saving application state, terminating communication channels, and powering off a variety of hardware systems (or more likely going into low-power consumption mode). It also uses a power driver (ACPI?) to interface with the computer's power management subsystem. This subsystem is instructed to shutdown, which in turn sends a signal to the computer's power supply to break the circuit and no longer supply power to the majority of components.If you think software is a different creature in comparison with hardware, no explanation would satisfy you. Think software like a sequence of electric charges. All the code that you write would get stored as sequence of electrical charges either on RAM or disk. So you are NOT writing text but the sequence of electric charges. Your video card is drawing the stuff on the monitor in English to help you to understand what you are typing. In one way, perhaps truly, whatever you do on the computer is physical.Software is stored in the hardware as magnetic domains on the hard drive or floppy disc, or as low and high voltages in computer chips. When you type on a keyboard, each character is converted into an electrical series of 0's and 1's which are then stored as low and high voltages in the computer chips called RAM. The low and high voltages in RAM are then converted into the magnetic domains on the hard drive or floppy disc for later reading back by the disc heads into voltages, or are stored as low and high voltages in non-volatile computer chips for later reading back. The low and high voltages represent the electrical 0's and 1's which were generated by the keyboard characters.Well, the shutdown isn't actually physical, all circuits in the computer aren't totally off until you physically unplug the power.

The software uses the APM (Advanced Power Management) interface in BIOS to control the power circuits in the computer.

When the computer is off, it can still be turned on without physically pulling a switch, for example by a Wake on LAN signal from a network card in the computer.The leg kicking a ball is a good example. It's quite similar in a machine. The CPU is connected to all the other parts of the system, but unlike the nervous system which is a physical wiring, with all nerves being connected at once, the CPU's does not maintain a permanent connection to the rest of the system. It connects to the desired part on demand - similar to making a telephone call - all telephones have connections, but only a few are connected at any one time.

The cpu does work by running instructions - the software program. There are instruction codes that instruct the cpu to dial some part of the system. Each part has a number, and the cpu has an instruction to dial a number. Once the cpu dials that number, it sends a message to that part - the message is simply data - from one bit up to any arbitrary size block. The hardware at that location then acts on the message encoded.

In doing it like this, the cpu can control any piece of hardware using the same mechanism. The only thing that changes for each device is the number the cpu has to dial and the data the cpu sends to the device - details that are put into the software the cpu is running.

So, to turn the machine off, the cpu dials the number for the power management device, and sends it instructions to go into an appropriate power state. The hardware responds, and the PSU stops sending primary power to the motherboard.

When you write softare, you don't have to know all these details yourself. They are usually pre-packaged as ready to use code, so your software just has to say ""shutdown"" and the ready-made codes for this (usually in the BIOS) are executed to perform the shutdown, as outlined above.One key important feature here is an amplification, the electrical signals used within a computer are tiny and always flowing as triggered by the clock, and as directed and amplified by the logic gates, they can be at some point sent out to physical devices connected to the computer where they can trigger an actual physical activity. Transistors are the ingenious components used to implement logic gates and amplification of signals. They are at the centre of the software-hardware interface.

Logic gates (low-level circuitry) and the CPU (higher abstraction of logic gates) are the key answer to your question. They are basically the bridge between software and hardware.

This is my super-simplified explanation. A CPU has a clock cycle which is usually triggered by naturally occurring vibrating elements like Quartz crystals. During every cycle, it fetches an instruction from memory (the software side) and its ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit runs some circuitry and based on the software instructions, and outputs some data which can potentially be written back to another memory location. 

Now on the hardware side, every piece of hardware has firmware on it, the firmware is a bunch of logical instructions usually wired with pure circuity (logic gates, again), based on the input it can output a specific combination of electrical signals which can be amplified and used to trigger an actual physical event e.g eject disk, switch on a light, e.t.cThere're several interfaces between PC programs and the real world outside.

Some connect to CPU. Examples of these are Ports and hardware interrupts (IRQ). These allow sending small amounts of data (by host program request) and calling functions (interrupt handlers) based on hardware triggers (discrete line going from low to high). 

There're faster interfaces for transferring massive amounts of data that bypass CPU. This is called DMA (direct memory access). These are used to transfer data to disk, network, display adapters, etc.

For port IO (opcodes IN and OUT) the software is the initiator. For IRQ, the hardware speaks up first to trigger software response. 

Only device drivers are allowed to do all these. If you try doing it from the application, OS will smash it at instant. Applications connect to this world thru APIs presented by device drivers. Many of the APIs are standardalized, so you can replace actual device without having to interact differently (a printer, disk, keyboard, mouse, CRROM, ATX power supply switch in your example).Let's compare the physical and the software solutions.

When you push the button, you are actually sending a 5 volt signal to the power supply unit. This 5 volts of power never actually switches off (even when you think your computer is off). You need this 5 volts for when you push the button to turn the computer on - at which point another 5 volts is sent in to the power supply unit to tell it to switch back on.

So in actual fact, your physical button press is converted into an electronic signal in order for the power supply to do something.

When you think of things in these terms you suddenly realise that the computer doesn't need to turn its electronic signal into a physical button-push to turn off the power - that's something they've added to benefit humans (i.e. if you thought there was a tiny motor that pushed a secret internal ""off"" button - it doesn't exist).

So all the software needs to do is instruct an electronic signal, which triggers the power supply to enter 5 volt standby mode.I had the same question taunting my brain since 2011 when I chose to become a Software Engineer.
As life moved on and my wish came true, I started working on different computer technologies and domains and I started answering for my own questions.

Firstly, I would define the Software as the set of automated instructions to the hardware. Instruction in this context means just the two states GoOn/GoOff or 1/0 or High/Low or True/False or Charge/NoCharge or PowerUp/PowerDown.

The working of any modern computers could be said as the instruction chain reactions of the hardware.

Why and How? Explained below,

Imagine!, you holding two wires connected to the bulb and attach them to the battery +ve and -ve. You know what happens now. Tantadaan!, Light glows up.

Here,
Hardware: Wires, bulb and the Holder.
Software/Instruction/Action: You attaching both of those wires to the battery.
Charge: Battery power.
Result: Light glows up.

In a similar way when you first turn on the computer you trigger the first instruction/action (GoOn) by pressing the button or a turning on the power switch.

Now, as I said the instructions (your software/text code converted to 1/0 instructions) drive the chain reactions in the hardware which leads your computer to function as defined in the instructions (Drivers/OS/Software). 

If you wish to know further in-depth, please leave a comment down.Actually, your plain text of codes does not make the computer shutdown directly. It calls a procedure of the underlying operating system. The operating system in turn invokes the ACPI/APM on your main board. This will then make the computer shut down.

How the little 1's and 0's interact with the circuits of your hardware is quite a complex subject which you could read at least one book about to completely understand it...If in case you are looking for how in general any device is made to perform its action, the device comes with firmwares stored in ROM / CHIP of the control board. The control board is used to control the device through electric signals.
Above the firmware, you will have drivers/service provider. The application will use these service providers/drivers to communicate or instruct the device to perform some action.
Click here to know more on how-firmwares-communicate-to-the-electronic-devices-to-perform-its-operations?I have pondered the same question for quiet sometime now and come to realize that there are in fact a connection from software(fantasy) world to hardware(real) world. 

Think of something as simple as circuits and switches, then think of something more abstract like an adder or ALU. Over time abstraction built on itself and gets complex in the next rom. Then comes the microcode, Opcodes, machine language then finally assembly and C. After that came BIOS, OS, drivers and GUI and hold and behold came your beloved ""Shut down"" button.Its simple:The codes/software we write are electric signals represented by 0's(OFF's) and 1's(ON's) on the actual CPU.From that point think of currents and motors.""How does plain text of codes make the computer do what it does?""

Let's say I write code in a text editor using any language like C++ or Java.
This code is given to the compiler and it then converts it into assembly code.
 Then, it's converted to binary, ie; 0's and 1's which represents digital voltages which are then fed into transistors in the hardware.",,,,,1,2479,89.91,40.55,46.43,23.81,21.94,25.29,80.07,61.92,49.9,8.07,3.23,0.81,0.32,1.77,0,0.32,4.84,16.18,10.61,1.73,14.64,6.37,3.75,6.33,0.44,12.99,5.12,3.63,2.62,0.48,0.4,1.77,13.19,0.73,12.46,2.62,2.99,1.05,2.34,0.52,3.39,0.16,0.65,0.44,0.16,0.12,0.04,0.04,0.04,0,0,0,6.82,3.71,0.08,0.08,0,0.04,2.58,2.62,0.04,0,0.04,0.04,4.8,0,0,4.8,4.32,0.16,0.08,4.07,0,0,0.97,0.2,0,0.08,0,0,0,0.04,0,0.44,0.12,0.2,0.08,0.04,0,0.04,0,0.28,3.99,9.32,0.08,2.14,6.82,0.48,0.08,0,2.9,1.77,5.93,0.97,0.04,0.04,0,0,0,18.23,5.32,5.04,0.32,0.08,1.41,6.05,
How does software activation work?,"I have tried searching, and all questions are related to specific things like ""how to generate key"", and the like. Can anybody explain how different types of software activation work?In the most simplistic case, it is as maxwell5555 described. A registration code (""CD key"") is sent to the user who enters it into the program or installer. The whole process can basically be done offline; the program itself locally determines that the code is valid or invalid.

This is nice and easy, but it extremely vulnerable to key sharing - since there's no ""phoning home"" then the application cannot know that thousands of different people are all using the same key that they got off the internet or a serial library or their friend. It's also reasonably easy to make ""keygens"" which generate valid-seeming keys that were never actually issued by the developers.

Then we get into online registration. You still have some kind of code, but the program will phone home back to the server to determine whether the code is valid and usually unique. This stops basic key sharing, because the company knows if too many people from all over the world are all using the same key. Perhaps there is some kind of indentification involved using MAC address, too, with infinte registrations allowed on the same hardware but maybe a limited number on what appears to be a different computer.

This is still pretty easy and stops simple key sharing. People will actually have to get into cracking the software or faking the server response to get past it.

Sometimes the program itself is partially/mostly encrypted and is only decrypted by the online registration step. Depending on how well this is obfuscated then it can be pretty difficult and time consuming to crack. Bioshock was a high-profile example of this - debuting with a brand new encryption/copy protection scheme that took around two weeks from release to be broken.

Finally, a particularly guarded applciation might stay in constant contact with the server, refusing to work at all if the connection is severed. In this case to get arouind the activation you need to fake the server itself. Steam emulators and private WoW servers are an example of this.

And in the end, nothing is uncrackable.I suspect a lot of the implementers will not give this information out because it opens them to hacking. But if I were to do this, this is how I would go about it:


Decide if the software is licensed to a person or a computer.
Find a way of identifying the person/computer (login account or ID from the computer hardware).
On request/payment: in your private database, create a licence key and add an entry for the person/PC with this key.
Provide the client software with the key.
Your software either stores the key locally, or regularly checks for the key giving a service of yours the identifying information in return for which your service supplies the key if there is one. If none is found, your software offers them details to purchase a licence. The latter allows for floating keys, computer upgrades, and identifying duplicate installations.


Is that what you were asking for?A common, simple way of implementing software activation/registration is to create a license algorithm.  For example, lets say I have some shareware I want to protect and when someone gives me money, I send them a 4-byte registration code.  I could build the algorithm into my shareware such that it validates the code the users enters.  My algorithm would be as follows:

1) Byte0 * Byte1 = 6
2) Byte2 - Byte3 = 1
3) Byte0 + Byte2 = 8


Two possible valid codes are:

3254
1676


When the user enters a valid code, the software unlocks its regular functionality by setting a flag somewhere.  Obviously, this is an extremely simplistic example.  Registration validation algorithms can be as complex as you want.

You can also perform this registration over the internet to protect your validation algorithm from reverse engineering, and keep people from sharing keys.

How often should you release software updates? [closed],"Whats the best release strategy?I would say in WordPress' specific case, they conflate ""security updates"" and ""functionality updates"". This is bad.

This would be like having to do an in-place reinstall of Windows every time a security bug was found, instead of simply downloading a small patch every week.

WordPress needs to have a security patch mechanism that's simple, fast, and easy for the security updates. A process that is separate from the normal upgrade flow of new versions.The frequency of Wordpress releases is so frequent because they care about security and release updates that fix known vulnerabilities as quickly as they can. Functionality updates to Wordpress happen much less frequently, in the range of every 4 to 6 months I think.

I think this is a good model. Keep your customers happy by releasing new features regularly, but if you find security flaws, release fixes immediately.I'll suggest the following:

updateTime (in seconds) - the average time it takes for the user to perform the update

releaseDelta (in days) - the minimum time between releases

releaseDelta = updateTime/((1/365)*(60*60*8))


This formula is based on my theory that a user should have to spend no more than 8 hours in any given year waiting for updates to an application.

This also allows for frequent updating as long as the updates are done in a transparent manner without disrupting the end user.I think this highly depends on your particularly situation. That being said, I think a daily release for any serious business application just totally ludicrous. If you are releasing every day then there is probably a serious problem unless you are in some very strange situation where business rules change constantly or something like that.Less frequently than iTunes updates.I try to use the following, hopefully simple, two-part guideline:


If it requires the user to download and/or install something, or change an existing codebase that they maintain, then releases need to provide significant merit.  This is a release that adds significant new features, fixed a significan amount of issues, or fixes a smaller number of immediate and pressing issues.

If it does not require the user to download and/or install releases will be planned to occur, as dictated by iteration.  If there is a releasable product at the end of the iteration, it will be deployed.  The iteration will contain technical and business needs as determined prior to the kickoff of the iteration.


So, for us, things like desktop applications or web services would generally fall under the first rule, and things such as our web site would fall under the second.  We run fairly good sized iterations - at about four to six weeks of development time currently, decreasing to two to four next year.  This was our ""introduction"" into a Scrum-hybrid.

Note that a product doesn't always have to be in development (or participating in an iteration).  It is quite possible that a product will sit, stale, until changes are needed if the first rule applies.It depends on the customers approach to configuration control.

They have a choice, you know. Ultimately they can chose not to use your product.

If the customer will accept you changing stuff every day, and they don't care, and it has no training or configuration management impact; have automatic updates.

Customers with SOE ( Standard operating environments) hate updates.

Realize that some customers are not going to accept software ""calling home"".
They will want to host their own updates. Their IT people will have to get involved.
This is more work for them.

Some customers will want/need to do their own QA; depends on the customer and the kind of software.

If the customer needs to do testing/work to accept/deploy the software, release some multiple of the length of the test/deploy cycle. Unless the customers are okay with interleaved deploy and test. That's where they are always testing a new version, and the  roll it out.

For example: 2 weeks to test, release not more than every 8 weeks.

In result critical software, release testing may take a customer months. They are betting their business on the results and are justifiably cautious.  So releases are every 6 months or so.

In safety critical software, it may take MANY months. Annual, or about every 18 months is not uncommon. Even less often is quite normal.There is no right answer, it really depends on the product.

I say monthly at most. Weekly/Daily is just too often, unless of course the application updates are done in a automated and transparent way, e.g. Firefox's update systemYou can release them as often as you want. The thing that frustrates users is not knowing whether they need your new version or not. This means that you need to be very clear about which new features you've implemented, the bugs that you've fixed, and whether or not you've fixed any security issues. More importantly, your users want to be able to trust that, if they do install a new version, nothing got broken.I think that if it's possible you should have your software update automatically when it needs to, so as to keep the whole update process as smooth and invisible to the user as possible.For the area I work in, Industrial controls, very seldom. We typically do a major release very 2 years. Minor releases maybe every 3 to 6 months. Bug patch are of course a different story, they are released as needed. Even then few customers will upgrade existing systems. Of course in other domains, upgrades are more accepted.I have no objections to security bugs getting fixed as soon as they're found - although I wish they'd write more robust code in the first place.  What I object (at least as far as Wordpress goes) is enhancement releases that could potentially break plug-ins happening too quickly.  How long did it take to go from 2.5 to 2.6?  And 2.7 is coming out very shortly as well.

An automatic or semi-automatic upgrade would mitigate some of that problem, but only if plugin writers upgrade as well, or if they separated security fixes from functionality changes so I could, say, stick with 2.5 but still be up to date with the security patches until I was sure all the plugins I use work with 2.6 or 2.7 or (by that time) 4.0.Whenever they are required. Keep in mind some users feel more secure getting updates regularly, while some just feel annoyed having a pop-up every day ""There are 129 new updates to install! click here to wait 20 minutes to download, then another 10 to install them!""... you see my point.It depends on the nature of the upgrade and the amount of user intervention necessary to accomplish it.

If it's a web site, you can upgrade every day, as long as you don't break anything.

If it's a free security update, ASAP is always appreciated.

A free bugfix upgrade, if it has to be installed by the user, shouldn't be more than every couple of months.

Anything that has to be paid for can't be more frequent than once a year, or people will start to feel taken advantage of.  Even more for certain classes of software, such as operating systems.Surely when you have new features/bug fixes worth releasing ?? Why have it on a schedule ?",,,,,1,1234,51.31,33.19,62.9,52.81,19.9,24.39,87.36,70.02,55.35,10.62,5.51,1.46,0.41,1.7,0,1.94,5.11,14.99,6.65,2.76,13.45,9.24,6.32,8.59,1.46,16.69,7.29,7.21,2.35,0.49,0.97,0.97,17.99,1.62,15.88,2.03,1.94,2.59,5.11,1.3,5.59,0,2.92,2.51,0.41,0.73,0.41,0.32,0,0.24,0,0,6.4,1.22,0.16,0,0.08,0,0.73,5.19,0,0,0,0.08,1.38,0,0,1.38,4.38,0.08,0.16,3.81,1.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.94,0.49,1.3,0,0,0.16,0.08,1.13,0.16,6,5.19,0.08,0.89,3.81,0.32,0,0.32,8.75,1.7,5.75,2.59,0.16,0.08,0.08,0,0,17.91,6.65,4.62,0.41,0.16,1.46,4.62,

Is that possible in visual studio setup deployment project?Every software you install, must create entry in Registry.So you can read the particular entry in registry from Visual studio Setup project.

Retrieve a Value from the Registry


  how to retrieve the MediaPath value for your computer from the
  registry,


The MediaPath value for your computer is located under the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
You can retrieve this value by using a launch condition. To do this, follow these steps:


In Visual Studio .NET, point to Editor on the View menu, and then
click Launch Conditions.
In the Launch Conditions Editor, click Search Target Machine.
On the Action menu, click Add Registry Search.


By default, Search for RegistryEntry1 is added.


On the View menu, click Properties Window to select the Properties
window for the registry search that you created in previous step.
Change the Name property value to Search for MediaPath.
Change the Property property value to MEDIA_PATH.


When you run the setup project, the MediaPath registry value is retrieved to your 
MEDIA_PATH property. 


To search HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in the registry, click the Root
property, and then click vsdrrHKLM in the drop-down list box for the
property value.
To search the SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion subkey, type
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion in the RegKey property
value text box.
To search for the MediaPath value, type MediaPath in the Value
property value text box.

How to cope with versioning of software documentation and the software itself? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 4 years ago. I need some experiences concerning the writing of software documentations and user guides. When I write formal documents like software specifications, every document gets a version number and in the document there is a change history after the table of contents, where you can keep track of the changes made to the document. If I'm now writing a software documentation or a user guide for an application, and the software has versioning itself, one could get confused with the version number of the document and the product: e.g. application version 1.5, documentation version 1.3. What's the common way / best practice to write software documentation? Do you keep track of changes to the documents there? If you print a change history - do you show changes to the product and/or the document?I've encountered this issue at every company for which I've worked that 1) had a significant code base, 2) attempted professional quality documentation, and 3) had separate development and documentation groups.

I have come to agree with Anders, convinced that software and documentation should have different versioning and version control systems.  Although similar and having the same target, documentation and code have different lifecycles, which can be fully independent, only being mapped one to the other at release time.

As for generating the documentation with each software build, ask yourself:  does that really make sense?  Is the documentation historical or is it prescriptive?  Any documentation that is generated with each build better have the tools in place to do it.  Currently, that only works for API documentation and there are Doxygen-/Javadoc-style tools to support it.  That is likely to never be doable for User's Guides and Installation Guides because they are context sensitive.

The need for different version control systems holds, particularly, for the newer structured documentation methodologies.  Structured documentation needs to be managed at a much finer level of granularity than source code to be able to efficiently handle something even as seemingly simple as rebranding; usually managed at either the paragraph, sentence, or word level, unlike the file level, which is sufficient for source code.  Further, it is generally economical for document elements to be shared among multiple products or departments (engineering, marketing, ...).  And, for this level of documentation sophistication, only a content management system is sufficient for tracking content and managing change; the CVS-/SVN-/Perforce-/Clearcase-style SCCSs are abysmally inadequate for managing real-world documentation.  Using different version management tools ensures different version numbers for documentation and software.

Documentation may even have a higher rate of change than software when the need for handling typos, grammar errors, and corporate style changes is considered.

Separating documentation and development processes reduces dependencies, which is the fundamental metric needed for producing a quality product.  Further, late binding is desirable to best accommodate the rapid rate of change and unpredictable events like late feature additions or deletions.  Only at the moment of final (or alpha-/beta release) should the documentation version be mapped to the software version.  But, I agree with High-Performance Mark that the end user shouldn't see different version numbers.  The documentation version number does not need to appear on the document.  That number can, within the documentation process, be maintained and hidden from the public.

The only time that software and documentation versioning can be maintained in lockstep is when documentation is a fully-integrated part of the development process.  Over the last 30 years, I've seen this becoming less and less the case because there is less formal, upfront design than there used to be, relying, instead, on an iterative, quick-prototyping approach to software development.  The original well-intentioned notions of having documentation drive software development have mostly been put aside but the new methodology also hasn't given us improved documentation or software.  Whether the documentation is done upfront or as an afterthought, it's still going to double the time it takes to develop a commercial-quality product.I think that the documentation and the software are different items, which each have different version numbers. You want to be able to update the documentation without having to update the software number. I would have named it something like:

System Documentation for productX 1.3

Documentation revision 1.7

By clearly including both the software version and the document version in the same place there shouldn't be any confusion.We tend to use a plain text format for our documentation, mainly LaTeX, and treat it just like source code from a revision point of view: it goes in the repo, we can do diffs and patches, etc.  We're not big for change histories in published documents, we can always audit what has gone on if necessary but it rarely is.  

As for synchronising code and documentation version numbers, our preferred approach is that v1.1.1 of a document matches v1.1.1 of the software, 3.2.45 matches 3.2.45 and so on.  However, in practice we often only have documentation for the first 2 digits (ie 1.1, 3.2) since the third digit is mainly for bug-fixes or performance enhancements.  The repo revision number is inserted into the documentation (and in the source code) using svn:keywords should we ever need it.

I'd like to tell you that the same makefile which builds our new version software also builds the new version of the documentation, but we haven't got there yet.  We are, however, working on it.Why don't you just use version control and use that as the automatic document revision? You can have most systems update some text on checkout.",,,,,1,945,67.76,15.09,39.96,36.92,23.05,29.84,80.95,63.17,50.16,7.94,3.49,1.16,1.27,0.95,0,0.11,4.44,12.8,8.36,2.54,12.28,9.42,5.19,7.72,0.85,15.56,6.56,3.39,3.28,1.38,1.38,0.53,18.84,0.74,18.1,1.06,3.39,3.17,3.07,0.32,7.83,0,1.9,1.48,0.32,0.53,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0,4.97,2.43,0.32,0,0,0,1.27,2.43,0,0,0,0,2.12,0,0,2.12,4.13,0,0,3.92,0.32,0,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.06,0.53,0.42,0.11,0.32,0,0,0.11,0.21,4.66,5.61,0.11,0.85,3.92,0.63,0,0.21,5.08,2.96,5.29,0.32,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,17.88,6.03,5.4,0.74,0,1.48,4.23,
How to design extensible software (plugin architecture)? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 5 years ago. I need some resources that talk about how to design your software to be extensible, i.e. so that other people can write add-ons/plug-ins that adds functionality to it. What do you recommend? Any books out there that discuss the subject?

I would prefer something that's short and to the point; a bit of theory and a bunch of concrete examples. I'm not targeting a specific language, I want to be able to understand the core idea so that I can implement it in any language. And for the same reason, I prefer not to do it using a framework that someone else built (unless the framework is not very high-level, i.e. doesn't hide too much), at the moment I only want to educate myself on the subject and experiment with various ways to implement it. Plus, a framework usually assumes user's knowledge about the subject. UPDATE I'm not asking about OOP or allowing my classes to be inherited. I'm talking about designing an application that will be deployed on a system, such that it can be extended by third-party add-ons AFTER its been deployed. For example, Notepad++ has a plug-in architecture where you can place a .dll file in the plugins folder, and it adds functionality to the application that wasn't there, such as color-picking, or snippet insertion, or many other things (a wide range of functionality).IF we're talking .NET, try Scripting .NET applications with VBScript over on CodeProject. Lots of concrete examples there.

Below are sites implementing various application extension techniques


ClearScript - Makes V8, VBScript and JScript available to .NET apps
CS-Script - The C# Script Engine
Plugin Architecture using C#
Opinio plugin architecture
Notes on the Eclipse Plug-in Architecture
Plug-in Architecture Framework for Beginners 
Gecko plugin architecture
Fungimol plugin architectureOSGI is a good practical example of a technical framework allowing to do what you are after.
The theory is here.
The (free!) book is there.
Extensibility and the ability to write plugin must deal with service lifecycle

adding / removing service/plugin on the spot
managing dependencies between services
managing states of services (declared, installed, started, stopped,...)

What is OSGI for ?

One of the main functions of a module is as a unit of deployment… something that we can either build or download and install to extend the functionality of our application.

You will find a good introduction here, on the central notion of service (which is related to your question, and which explain some problems around services, key component for extensibility).
Extract:

Why are services then so important if so many applications can be built without them? Well, services are the best known way to decouple software components from each other.
One of the most important aspects of services is that they significantly minimize class loading problems because they work with instances of objects, not with class names. Instances that are created by the provider, not the consumer. The reduction of the complexity is quite surprising
Not only do services minimize configuration, they also significantly reduce the number of shared packages.Implement SOLID principles in your application.

1. Single responsibility principle: A class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class

2.Open/closed principle: Software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification

3. Liskov substitution principle: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program

4. Interface segregation principle: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

5. Dependency inversion principle: One should Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions

Stackoverflow questions:

Example of Single Responsibility Principle

Is the Open/Closed Principle a good idea?

What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?

Interface Segregation Principle- Program to an interface

What is the Dependency Inversion Principle and why is it important?You try to reach two competing goals:


The components of your software must expose a lot of themselves, so they can be reused
The components of your software must expose very little of themselves, so they can be reused


Explanation: To encourage code reuse, you should be able to extend existing classes and call their methods. This isn't possible when the methods are declared ""private"" and the classes are ""final"" (and can't be extended). So to meet this goal, everything should be public and accessible. No private data or methods.

When you release the second version of your software, you will find that many of the ideas of version 1 were plain wrong. You need to change many interfaces or your code, method names, delete methods, break the API. If you do this, many people will turn away. So in order to be able to evolve your software, the components must not expose anything that is not absolutely necessary - at the cost of code reuse.

Example: I wanted to observe the position of the cursor (caret) in an SWT StyledText. The caret is not meant to be extended. If you do it, you'll find that the code contains checks like ""is this class in the package org.eclipse.swt"" and a lot of methods are private and final and whatnot. I had to copy about 28 classes out of SWT into my project just to implement this feature because everything is locked down.

SWT is a nice framework to use and hell to extend.Of course there is the famous Open Closed Principle - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principleWell it depends on the language. 


In C/C++ I'm pretty sure there is a loadlibrary function that allows you to open a library at runtime and invoke it's exported functions. This is typically how it's done in C/C++.
In .NET, there is Reflection, which is offers similar (but more broad) to loadlibrary. There is also entire libraries built on Reflection like Managed Extension Framework, or Mono.Addins that does most of the heavy lifting for you already.
In Java, there is also Reflection. And there is the JPF (Java Plugin Framework) which is used in stuff like Eclipse IIRC.


Depending on what language you use I could recommend some tutorial/books. I hope this was helpful.Plugin architecture is becoming very popular for its extensibility and thus flexibility.

For c++, Apache httpd server is actually plugin based, but a concept of module is used instead. Most of apache features are implemented as modules, like cache, rewrite, load balancing, and even threading model. It is a very modular software I ever saw.

And for java, Eclipse is definitely plugin based. The core of Eclipse is an OSGI module system which manage bundles, another concept for plugin. Bundle can provide extension points on which we can build modules with less efforts. The most intricate thing in OSGI is its dynamic characteristic, which means bundles can be installed or uninstalled at runtime. No stop-the-world syndrome any more!Since I dont have enough rep points to leave a comment, I am posting this as an answer. SharpDevelop is an IDE for developing applications in C#/VB.NET/Boo. It has a pretty impressive architecture that allows itself to be extended in a number of ways - right from new menu items to development support for whole new languages.

It uses a bit of XML configuration to act as a glue layer between a core of the IDE and the plugin implementation. It handles locating, loading and versioning of plugins out of the box. Deploying new plugins is matter of simply copying in the new xml configuration file and the required assemblies (DLLs) and restarting the application. You can read more on this in the book ""Dissecting a csharp application"" by the original author(s) - Christian Holm, Mike Krüger, Bernhard Spuida of the application from here. The book doesnt seem to be available on that site, but i found a copy that might still be around here

Also found a related question hereCheckout ""CAB"" - Microsoft's Composition Application Building blocks Framework. I think they've got a ""web version"" of that too...I have just started to develop a smart client application.  These are two options I am considering.

Using Microsoft's System.AddIn namespace. Looks very promising, however it may be a little complex for our end solution.

Or the Smart Client - Composite UI Application Block from Microsoft

Recently, i have looked at taking components both the Composite UI Application Block and the System.AddIn namespace to build my own. Since source code is available for the CAB it is easy to extend.  I think our end solution will be a light weight version of the CAB, definatly using the Unity Application BlockIf you work with .Net, our research yielded two approaches: scripting and composition.

Scripting

You extend the functionality of what your classes can do by orchestrating them using scripts. That means exposing what is compiled in your favorite .Net language in a dynamic language.

Some options we found worth exploring:


IronPython
IronRuby
JavaScript: Jint, Jurassic and JavaScript .Net are good starting points.
Script.Net -> this one was the first one to call our attention.


Composition

If you start a project with .Net 4 or above, you must take a good look at the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF). It allows you to extend the functionality of your apps in a plugin way.


  The Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) is a composition layer for
  .NET that improves the flexibility, maintainability and testability of
  large applications. MEF can be used for third-party plugin
  extensibility, or it can bring the benefits of a loosely-coupled
  plugin-like architecture to regular applications.


Managed Add-in Framework is also a good read.

How to detect Adblock on my website?,"I would like to be able to detect if the user is using adblocking software when they visit my website. If they are using it, I want to display a message asking them to turn it off in order to support the project, like this website does. If you enter to that site and your browser has some kind of adblock software enabled, then the site instead of showing the actual ads shows a little banner telling the users that the ad revenue is used for hosting the project and they should consider turning Adblock off. I want to do that on my website, I'm using adsense ads on it, How can I do that?My solution is not specific to a certain ad network and is very lightweight. I've been running it in production for a few years. AdBlock blocks all URLs containing the word ""ads"" or ""prebid"". So this is what I did:
I added a small js file to my webroot with the name prebid-ads.js
This is the only line of code in that file. Update 2022-04-26 Call this variable something else, see below!
var canRunAds = true;

Then somewhere in your page:
<html>
  <head>
    <script src=""/js/prebid-ads.js""></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      if( window.canRunAds === undefined ){
        // adblocker detected, show fallback
        showFallbackImage();
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

Update 2022-04-26 uBlock Origin loads their own ads-prebid.js that reverts the trick described in this answer (proud!), their file contains the following:
(function() {
    'use strict';
    window.canRunAds = true;
    window.isAdBlockActive = false;
})();

As a solution just rename your canRunAds variable to something fun, like window.adsAreWithUs or window.moneyAbovePrivacy.
Discovery and workaround by Ans de Nijs. Thanks!
Supporting extensions
Files like ads.js are blocked by at least these adblockers on Chrome:

AdBlock
Adblock Plus
Adblock Pro
Ghostery

Does not work with:
Privacy BadgerNot a direct answer, but I'd put the message behind the ad to be loaded... rather that trying to detect it, it'd just show up when the ad doesn't.async function detectAdBlock() {
  let adBlockEnabled = false
  const googleAdUrl = 'https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js'
  try {
    await fetch(new Request(googleAdUrl)).catch(_ => adBlockEnabled = true)
  } catch (e) {
    adBlockEnabled = true
  } finally {
    console.log(`AdBlock Enabled: ${adBlockEnabled}`)
  }
}

With jQuery:

function blockAdblockUser() {
    if ($('.myTestAd').height() == 0) {
        window.location = 'http://example.com/AdblockNotice.html';
    }
}

$(document).ready(function(){
    blockAdblockUser();
});


Of course, you would need to have a landing page for AdblockNotice.html, and the .myTestAd class needs to reflect your actual ad containers. But this should work.

EDIT

As TD_Nijboer recommends, a better way is to use the :hidden (or :visible, as I use below) selector so that display: none is also checked:

function blockAdblockUser() {
    if ($('.myTestAd').filter(':visible').length == 0) {
        // All are hidden, or ""not visible"", so:
        // Redirect, show dialog, do something...
    } else if ($('.myTestAd').filter(':hidden').length > 0) {
        // Maybe a different error if only some are hidden?
        // Redirect, show dialog, do something...
    }
}


Of course, both of these could be combined into one if block if desired.

Note that visibility: hidden will not be captured by either as well (where the layout space stays, but the ad is not visible). To check that, another filter can be used:

$('.myTestAd').filter(function fi(){
    return $(this).css('visibility') == 'hidden';
})


Which will give you an array of ad elements which are ""invisible"" (with any being greater than 0 being a problem, in theory).Most ads are dynamically loaded in javascript.  I just used the onerror event to detect whether the ad script could be loaded or not.  Seems to work.

Example with GoogleAds:

<script async src=""//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"" onerror=""adBlockFunction();""></script>


This can be used on other elements as well to see if an ad blocker is blocking the content.  This method can produce false positives if the remote elements doesn't exist or cannot be reached.To detect if the user is blocking ads, all you have to do is find a function in the ad javascript and try testing for it. It doesn't matter what method they're using to block the ad. Here's what it looks like for Google Adsense ads:

if(!window.hasOwnProperty('google_render_ad') || window.google_render_ad === undefined) { 
    //They're blocking ads, display your banner
}


This method is outlined here: http://www.metamorphosite.com/detect-web-popup-blocker-software-adblock-spamYou don't need an extra HTTP request , you may simply calculate the height of a fake add.
By the way, here is a full list matching the elements that adblockers avoid rendering.


window.adBlockRunning = function() {
    return (getComputedStyle(document.getElementById(""detect""))[""display""] == ""none"") ? true : false;
  }()

console.log(window.adBlockRunning);
#detect {
  height: 1px;
  width: 1px;
  position: absolute;
  left: -999em;
  top: -999em
}

 Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippetMy advice is: don't do it!

Any scenario where you treat people as ""wrongdoers"" is going to result in them fighting back.

Here's my proposal.

Put a small unobtrusive message at the top of the page (regardless of whether ads are being blocked) with the text I *totally* respect your right to block ads and a link to another page/pop-up entitled Read more ....

On the other page, make it clear that you understand it's their computer and they are free to use ad blocking.

Also make it clear in a non-accusatory way that the use of these blockers makes it more difficult for you to deliver great content (explaining why in detail) and that, while you'd prefer the ad blocking to not happen on your site, it's totally their decision. Focus on the positives of turning off blocking.

Those who are vehemently opposed to ads will ignore this but you never stood a chance of convincing them anyway. Those who are indifferent may well be swayed by your appeal since you're not doing the whole ""let me get my way or I'll take my ball and go home"" thing that honestly should be the exclusive domain of five year old children.

Remember, no-one held a gun to your head and forced you to put your stuff on the net. Treat your readership/users with respect and you'll probably find a good number of them will reciprocate.My easiest solution with jquery is:

$.ajax({
    url: ""/scripts/advertisement.js"", // this is just an empty js file
    dataType: ""script""
}).fail(function () {
    // redirect or display message here
});


advertisement.js just contains nothing. When somebody uses adblock, it fails and the function gets called.Just add small script on your site:

var isAdsDisplayed = true;


With name adsbygoogle.js

Then do following:

<script src=""/js/adsbygoogle.js""></script>
<script>
if(window.isAdsDisplayed === undefined ) {
  // AdBlock is enabled. Show message or track custom data here
}
</script>


Found this solution hereAn efficient way to check if there is an adblock:
Simply check if there is adblock enabled by trying to trigger the URL of google ads. If yes then run the callback_has_adblock, if not then run the callback_no_adblock. This solution costs one request more but at least it always works:
var hasAdBlock = function (callback_has_adblock, callback_no_adblock) {

    $.getScript( ""https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"" )
        .done(function( script, textStatus ) {
            callback_no_adblock();
        })
        .fail(function( jqxhr, settings, exception ) {
            callback_has_adblock();
    });
};

This solution works for all kind of ads, not only google adsense.I know there are already enough answers, but since this question comes up on Google searched for ""detect adblock"" at the topic, I wanted to provide some insight in case you're not using adsense.

Specifically, with this example you can detect if the default Adblock-list provided by Firefox Adblock is used. It takes advantage that in this blocklist there is an element blocked with the CSS id #bottomAd. If I include such an element in the page and test for it's height, I know whether adblocking is active or not:

<div id=""bottomAd"" style=""font-size: 2px;"">&nbsp;</div>
<!-- some code after -->


The rest is done via the usual jQuery suspect:

$(document).ready( function() {
  window.setTimeout( function() {
    var bottomad = $('#bottomAd');
    if (bottomad.length == 1) {
      if (bottomad.height() == 0) {
        // adblocker active
      } else {
        // no adblocker
      }
    }      
  }, 1);
}


As can be seen, I'm using setTimeout with at least a timeout of 1ms. I've tested this on various browsers and most of the time, directly checking for the element in ready always returned 0; no matter whether the adblocker was active or not. I was having two ideas about this: either rendering wasn't yet done or Adblock didn't kick in yet. I didn't bother to investigate further.They're utilizing the fact that Google's ad code creates an iframe with the id ""iframe"".  So as long as you don't already have something on your page with that ID, this'd work for you too.

<p id=""ads"">
<script type=""text/javascript""><!--
google_ad_client = ""their-ad-code-here"";
/* 160x600, droite */
google_ad_slot = ""their-ad-code-here"";
google_ad_width = 160;
google_ad_height = 600;
//-->
</script>
<script type=""text/javascript""
src=""http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"">
</script>

</p>

<script type=""text/javascript""><!--
if(document.getElementsByTagName(""iframe"").item(0) == null)
{
    document.write(""<div style='width:160px; height:600px; padding-top: 280px; margin-left:5px;border:1px solid #000000; text-align:center; font-family:century gothic, arial, helvetica, sans serif;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;'>Advertising seems to be blocked by your browser.<br /><br /><span style='font-size:10px'>Please notice that advertising helps us to host the project.<br /><br />If you find these ads intrusive or inappropriate, please contact me.</span><img src='http://www.playonlinux.com/images/abp.jpg' alt='Adblock Plus' /></div>"");
}
--></script>the safe way is to wrap your ads inside <div> and check the height

<div id=""check-ab"">
/* your ads code */
</div>

setTimeout(function(){
  if(document.getElementById(""check-ab"").offsetHeight === 0){
    console.log(""ads blocked"");
  }
  else{
    console.log(""ads running"");
  }
}, 100);


it work with adblock plus and bluehell firewall.I noticed previous comments uses google adsense as object to test. Some pages don't uses adsense, and using adsense block as test is not really a good idea. Because adsense block may harm your SEO. 
Here is example how I detect by adblocker simple blocked class:

Html:

<div class=""ad-placement"" id=""ablockercheck""></div>
<div id=""ablockermsg"" style=""display: none""></div>


Jquery:

$(document).ready(function()
{
   if(!$(""#ablockercheck"").is("":visible""))
   {
     $(""#ablockermsg"").text(""Please disable adblocker."").show();
   }
});


""ablockercheck"" is an ID which adblocker blocks. So checking it if it is visible you are able to detect if adblocker is turned On.This one works good
if there's an adBlocker it will alert you
Simply it sends a header request to a well known ad company for all ad blockers (google ads), if the request is blocked then adbloker exists.


checkAdBlocker();

function checkAdBlocker() {
    try {
        fetch(
            new Request(""https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"", {
                method: 'HEAD',
                mode: 'no-cors'
            })).catch(error => {
            showNotification()
        });
    } catch (e) {
        // Request failed, likely due to ad blocker
        showNotification()
    }
}

function showNotification() {
    alert(""Please disable adBlocker"")
}
 Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippetAdBlock seems to block the loading of AdSense (etc) JavaScript files. So, if you are using asynchronous version of AdSense ads you can check if adsbygoogle is an Array. This must be checked after few seconds since the asynchronous script is... asynchronous. Here is a rough outline:

window.setTimeout(function(){
    if(adsbygoogle instanceof Array) {
        // adsbygoogle.js did not execute; probably blocked by an ad blocker
    } else {
        // adsbygoogle.js executed
    }
}, 2000);


To clarify, here is an example of what the AdSense asynchronous ads code looks like:

<!-- this can go anywhere -->
<script async src=""//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js""></script>

<!-- this is where the ads display -->
<ins class=""adsbygoogle"" ...></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>


Notice that adsbygoogle is initialized as an Array. The adsbygoogle.js library changes this array into Object {push: ...} when it executes. Checking the type of variable after a certain time can tell you if the script was loaded.async function hasAdBlock() {
  try {
    await fetch(""https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"", {
      method: ""HEAD"",
      mode: ""no-cors"",
    })
    return false;
  } catch(e) {
    return true;
  }
}This approach I use on my site, maybe you will find it helpful. In my opinion, it's the simpliest solution.

AdBlocker blocks specific classes and html elements, by inspecting these selectors of any blocked ads in developer console (they are all listed) you can see which elements will be always blocked. 

E.g. just inspect this question page on stackoverflow and you will see bunch of blocked ads.

For example, any element with bottom-ad class is automatically blocked.


I created a non-empty div element with bottom-ad class:
<div class=""bottom-ad"" style=""width: 1px; height: 1px;"">HI</div>
After page loads just check if this element is hidden. I used jQuery, but feel free to use javascript:
$('.bottom-ad').css('display') == ""none"" or even better by using $('.bottom-ad').is(':visible')


If value is true, then AdBlocker is active.Most adblocker cancel HTTP request to ads.js and make 0px for the element but sometime adblocker removed the DOM, and some answer above will fail because not checking existence of the element. 

Using setTimeout() is good practice because without it, will make the script race with adblocker.

The script below will check if dom exist/removed and check offsetHeight of an element if it exist.



setTimeout(function() {
  var a = document.querySelector('.showads'),
    b = a ? (a.offsetHeight ? false : true) : true;
  console.log('ads blocked?', b)
}, 200); // don't too fast or will make the result wrong.
<div class=""ads showads"">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
</div>
 Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippetDespite the age of this question, I recently found it very useful and therefore can only assume there are others still viewing it. After looking here and elsewhere I surmised that the main three client side checks for indirectly detecting an ad blocker were to check for blocked  div/img, blocked iframes and blocked resources (javascript files).

Maybe it's over the top or paranoid but it covers for ad blocking systems that block only one or two out of the selection and therefore may not have been covered had you only done the one check.

On the page your are running the checks add: (I am using jQuery)

<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery.js""></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""advertisement.js""></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""abds.js""></script>


and add the following anywhere else on the page:

<div id=""myTestAd""><img src=""http://placehold.it/300x250/000000/ffffff.png&text=Advert"" /></div>


I used a div with a bait name as well as an externally hosted image with the text ""Advert"" and in dimensions used by AdSense (thanks to placehold.it!).

In advertisement.js you should append something to the document which we can check for later. Although it seems like you're doing the same as before, you are actually checking for the file (advertisement.js) itself being loaded, not the output.

$(document).ready(
{

    $(""body"").append(""<div id=\""myTestAd2\"">check</div>"");

});


And then the ad blocker detection script which combines everything

$(document).ready(function()
{
    var ifr = '<iframe id=""adServer"" src=""http://ads.google.com/adserver/adlogger_tracker.php"" width=""300"" height=""300""></iframe>';
    $(""body"").append(ifr);
});

$(window).on(""load"",function()
{

    var atb = $(""#myTestAd"");
    var atb2= $(""#myTestAd2"");
    var ifr = $(""#adServer"");

    setTimeout(function()
    {

        if( (atb.height()==0) ||
            (atb.filter("":visible"").length==0) ||
            (atb.filter("":hidden"").length>0) ||
            (atb.is(""hidden"")) ||
            (atb.css(""visibility"")==""hidden"") ||
            (atb.css(""display"")==""none"") ||
            (atb2.html()!=""check"") ||
            (ifr.height()!=300) ||
            (ifr.width()!=300) )
        {
            alert(""You're using ad blocker you normal person, you!"");
        }

    },500);

});


When the document is ready, i.e. the markup is loaded, we add the iframe to the document also. Then, when the window is loaded, i.e. the content incl. images etc. is loaded, we check:


The dimensions and visibility of the first test div.
That the content of the second test div is ""check"", as it would have been if the advertimsent.js was not blocked.
The dimensions (and I guess visibility, as a hidden object has no height or width?) of the iframe


And the styles:

div#myTestAd, iframe#adServer
{
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    left: -9999px;
    top: -9999px;
}

div#myTestAd2
{
    display: none;
}


Hope this helpsIf using the new AdSense code, you can do an easy check, with out resorting to content or css checks.

Place your ads as normal in your markup:

<ins class=""adsbygoogle"" style=""display: block;""
   data-ad-client=""ca-pub-######""
   data-ad-slot=""#######""
   data-ad-format=""auto""></ins>
<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>


Then you call the adsense code at the bottom of your page (note do not use the ""async"" flag when calling the adsbygoogle.js script):

<script src=""//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js""></script>


Then add this little snippit of code below that:

<script>
if (!adsbygoogle.loaded) {
   // do something to alert the user
}
</script>


AdSense always creates/sets the flag adsbygoogle.loaded to true when the ads are loaded,  You could place the check in a setTimeout function to delay the check by a few seconds.html file
<script src=""wp-banners.js""></script>

<script>
if(document.getElementById('LavXngdFojBe')){
  alert('Blocking Ads: No');
} else {
  alert('Blocking Ads: Yes');
}
</script>

wp-banners.js
var e=document.createElement('div');
e.id='LavXngdFojBe';
e.style.display='none';
document.body.appendChild(e);

This is also shown on https://detectadblock.com.if you are using react with hooks:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const AdblockDetect = () => {
  const [usingAdblock, setUsingAdblock] = useState(false)

  let fakeAdBanner
  useEffect(() => {
    if (fakeAdBanner) {
      setUsingAdblock(fakeAdBanner.offsetHeight === 0)
    }
  })

  if (usingAdblock === true) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div
        ref={r => (fakeAdBanner = r)}
        style={{ height: '1px', width: '1px', visibility: 'hidden', pointerEvents: 'none' }}
        className=""adBanner""
      />
      Adblock!
    </div>
  )
}

export default AdblockDetectIn case you use jQuery and Google Adsense:
jQuery.getScript(
    ""https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"", 
    function() {
     // Load your ad now    
}).fail(function() {
    // Google failed to load main script, do something now
});

This is easier to understand: if Google Ads main JavaScript file fails to load, AdSense won't work, so you do something using the fail function of jQuery.
The ""Loads your add now"" is when I append the ""ins"" objects, like:
jQuery("".my_ad_div"").append('<ins class=""adsbygoogle""
style=""display:block""
data-ad-client=""ca-pub-xxx""
data-ad-slot=""xxx""
data-ad-format=""auto""
data-full-width-responsive=""true""></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>');

And in ""// Google failed to load main script, do something now"" I generally put images in places of ads.<script src=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js""></script>
<script>var adb=true;</script>
<script src=""./getbanner.cfm?""></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){if(adb)alert('AdBlock!');});
</script>


and in getbanner.cfm file:

adb = false;


I think it's easiest way to detect adblock.I know this is already answered, but I looked at the suggested sample site, and I see they do it like this:

<script type=""text/javascript"">
if(document.getElementsByTagName(""iframe"").item(0) == null) {
    document.write(""<div style=""width: 160px; height: 600px; padding-top: 280px; margin-left: 5px; border: 1px solid #666666; color: #FFF; background-color: #666; text-align:center; font-family: Maven Pro, century gothic, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; border-radius: 7px; font-size: 18px;"">Advertising seems to be blocked by your browser.<br><br><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">Please notice that advertising helps us to host the project.<br><br>If you find these ads intrusive or inappropriate, please contact me.</span><br><img src=""http://www.playonlinux.com/images/abp.png"" alt=""Adblock Plus""></div>"");
};
</script>No need for timeouts and DOM sniffing. Simply attempt to load a script from popular ad networks, and see if the ad blocker intercepted the HTTP request.

/**
 * Attempt to load a script from a popular ad network. Ad blockers will intercept the HTTP request.
 *
 * @param {string} url
 * @param {Function} cb
 */
function detectAdBlockerAsync(url, cb){
    var script = document.createElement('script');

    script.onerror = function(){
        script.onerror = null;
        document.body.removeChild(script);
        cb();
    }

    script.src = url;
    document.body.appendChild(script);
}

detectAdBlockerAsync('http://ads.pubmatic.com/AdServer/js/gshowad.js', function(){
    document.body.style.background = '#c00';
});this worked for me the document has to be ready before you look for adblock 
hope this help someone!

jQuery(document).ready(function() {

var adBlockEnabled = false;
var testAd = document.createElement('div');
testAd.innerHTML = '&nbsp;';
testAd.className = 'adsbox';
document.body.appendChild(testAd);
window.setTimeout(function() {
  if (testAd.offsetHeight === 0) {
    adBlockEnabled = true;
  }
  testAd.remove();
  console.log('AdBlock Enabled? ', adBlockEnabled)
}, 100);


});All of the answers above are valid, however most will not work for DNS-level ad blocking.

DNS-level ad blockers(like pi-hole) basically return NXDOMAIN(domain does not exist) for a list of ad blocking domains (e.g. telemetry.microsoft.com will ""not exist"" when it does). 

There are a few ways to circumvent this:

Method A: Request for ads by ip address, not domain.

This method is a bit annoying as you would have to keep track of ip addresses. This will be problematic if your code isn't well maintained or updated regularly.

Method B: Block all requests that fail- even if the client reports NXDOMAIN.

This will be very annoying for users if it is a ""legitimate"" NXDOMAIN.",,,,,1,3536,59.88,24.36,23.04,8.78,34.33,23.9,66.69,49.89,38.12,8.8,4.44,1.87,0.14,1.89,0,0.48,4.36,10.44,5.18,2.6,8.29,7.01,3.54,5.77,1.61,12.08,4.47,3.17,2.43,0.23,1.3,0.93,13.66,1.13,12.5,1.81,1.98,1.75,3.62,0.54,4.41,0.03,4.19,1.44,2.66,2.57,0.28,2.18,0.03,0.06,1.64,0,6.05,3.05,0.48,0.59,0.11,0.25,1.3,2.91,0,0,0,0.06,1.64,0,0,1.64,2.86,0.03,0.57,2.06,0.2,0,0.45,0.03,0,0,0.03,0,0,0,0.03,0.23,0.17,0.37,0.06,0.08,0,0.03,0.62,0.28,3.22,8.6,1.64,1.24,4.07,1.84,0,0.06,2.4,1.58,4.52,1.05,2.21,2.15,0.06,0,0,67.79,9.47,3.45,0.25,0.59,3.79,50.23,

It can also hide main menu altogether and have it appear only on mouse over or alt key press (like in IE)After years Microsoft has changed their mind on this feature. As of Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 RC, an option has been added to change between mixed case and upper case: Tools -> Options -> Environment -> General -> Turn off upper case in the menu bar

Obviously this is not for VS 2012 but going forward this option will be there.

Here is the notification from Brian Harry of Microsoft:


  Mixed Case Menus – I know I’m going to get some feedback on this one :)  This is a long standing request by a vocal portion of the VS user base since VS 2012 to change the “ALL CAPS” menus.  In VS 2013 Update 3, we have added a Tools –> Options setting to control whether you see ALL CAPS or Mixed Case.  The default is still ALL CAPS but, if you change it, it will persist across upgrades and will roam across your IDE instances using the VS Online roaming settings feature (if you log into VS so it knows who you are).And for

The answer is to enable the option boflynn identified:

	While I understand your concern, please do bare in mind that if we release an update that affects every theme, then every theme author will submit a new version of every one of their themes. This is in addition to updated applications and plugins. These things do take time to go through.



	If you have items that your site relies on, you should really check there are updates for these before updating your site.And why not automate it? It wouldn't be easier and more practical to let the system accept these updates automatically.

	Since there is a high demand for apps and themes is better than making customers wait for weeks after a theme or app update.



	I believe that with a good team of developers it would not be a problem for you to automate sending updates to the marketplace.On 8/15/2022 at 11:25 AM,   Marco Junior said:

How to distribute ruby software?,"Hi i am serching for the best way to distribute ruby software (can be open or commercial) to clients:

Phooey to that, I say!

I put together the below powershell scripts for exporting and importing PuTTY settings. The exported file is a windows .reg file and will import cleanly if you have permission, otherwise use import.ps1 to load it.

Warning: messing with the registry like this is a Bad Idea™, and I don't really know what I'm doing. Use the  below scripts at your own risk, and be prepared to have your IT department re-image your machine and ask you uncomfortable questions about what you were doing.

.\export.ps1


On the target machine:

Done.If You want to import settings on PuTTY Portable You can use the  putty.reg file.

Just put it to this path [path_to_Your_portable_apps]PuTTYPortable\Data\settings\putty.reg. Program will import itFor those of you who need to import Putty from offline registry file e.g. when you are recovering from crashed system or simply moving to a new machine and grabbing data off that old drive there is one more solution worth mentioning:

http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/registry_file_offline_export.html

This great and free console application will export the entire registry or only a specific registry key. In my case i simply copied the registry file from an old drive to the same directory as the exporter tool and then i used following command and syntax in CMD window run as administrator:

RegFileExport.exe NTUSER.DAT putty.reg ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham""

After importing the .reg file and starting Putty everything was there. Simple and efficient.For those who don't want to mess with the registry, a variation of putty that saves to file has been created. It is located here: http://jakub.kotrla.net/putty/

It would be nice if the putty team would take this as an option into the main distribution.This was so much easier importing the registry export than what is stated above.

reg export HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY putty.regExample:

How to transfer putty configuration and session configuration from one user account to another e.g. when created a new account and want to use the putty sessions/configurations from the old account

Process:

 - Export registry key from old account into a file

 - Import registry key from file into new account

Export reg key: (from OLD account) 



Login into the OLD account e.g. tomold
Open normal  'command prompt' (NOT admin !)
Type 'regedit'
Navigate to registry section where the configuration is being stored e.g. [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SimonTatham] and click on it
Select 'Export' from the file menu or right mouse click (radio ctrl 'selected branch')
Save into file and name it e.g. 'puttyconfig.reg'
Logout again


Import reg key: (into NEW account) 



Login into NEW account e.g. tom
Open normal 'command prompt' (NOT admin !)
Type 'regedit'
Select 'Import' from the menu
Select the registry file to import e.g. 'puttyconfig.reg'
Done


Note:

Do not use an 'admin command prompt' as settings are located under '[HKEY_CURRENT_USER...] 'and regedit would run as admin and show that section for the admin-user rather then for the user to transfer from and/or to.If you, like me, installed new Windows and only after you remember about putty sessions, you can still import them, if you have old Windows hard drive or at least your old ""home"" directory backed up (C:\Users\<user_name>).

In this directory there should be NTUSER.DAT file. It is hidden by default, so you should enable hidden files in your Windows explorer or use another file browser. This file contains the HKEY_CURRENT_USER branch of your old Windows registry.

To use it, you need to open regedit on your new Windows, and select HKEY_USERS key.

Then select File -> Load Hive... and find your old ""home"" directory of your old Windows installation. In this directory there should be NTUSER.DAT file. It is hidden by default, so, if you didn't enable to show hidden files in your Windows explorer properties, then you can just manually enter file name into File name input box of ""Load Hive"" dialog and press Enter. Then in the next dialog window enter some key name to load old registry into it. e.g. tmp.

Your old registry's HKEY_CURRENT_USER branch now should be accessible under HKEY_USERS\tmp branch of your current registry.

Now export HKEY_USERS\tmp\Software\SimonTatham branch into putty.reg file, open this file in your favorite text editor and find-and-replace all HKEY_USERS\tmp string with HKEY_CURRENT_USER. Now save the .reg file.

You can import now this file into your current Windows registry by double-clicking it. See m0nhawk's answer how to do this.

In the end, select HKEY_USERS\tmp branch in the registry editor and then select File -> Unload Hive... and confirm this operation.An improvement to the solution of bumerang to import data to PuTTY portable.

Simply moving exported putty.reg (with m0nhawk solution) to PuTTYPortable\Data\settings\ didn't work. PuTTY Portable backup the file and create a new empty one.

To workaround this issue, merge both putty.reg copying manually the config you want to migrate from your exported putty.reg to the newly created PuTTYPortable\Data\settings\putty.reg below following lines.

Instead, using the following scripts would export/import the settings of putty:

::export
@echo off
set regfile=putty.reg
pushd %~dp0

reg export HKCU\Software\SimonTatham %regfile% /y

popd

::import

Export to .reg
Perform a search and replace over .reg
Remove all sessions
Import the new .reg

How to force use of Prefixes,"Inside of a forum, I would like to set up when a topic i send, it needs to be going with a prefixes selected. 



	So we need prefixes vissible under the Title field, after put the title just obviously select which prefix selected and post it. If the prefixes is not selected, just don't let it posted.There is no default option to require a prefix before being able to submit a topic.



	 



	This 3rd party modification can help however:




	The description mentions several things about forums and prefixes:

			Forum / Category settings
		

		
			Radical Tags allows you to configure settings for tags and prefixes on a per-category basis. These settings include..
		

		
				Requiring a prefix
			
			
				Customizing the tag mode (open, closed, or prefix only)
			
			
				Setting a custom language string for the Prefix input (for example, “Platform” on gaming themed forums)
			
			
				Customizing lists of allowed or suggested tags
			
			
				Customizing which prefixes are allowed to be used
			
			
				Setting a default prefix
			
			
				Setting the minimum number of tags that must be used
			
			
				Setting the maximum number of tags that can be used
			
		  ExpandThat's strange, I would have thought prefixes could be set for forum topic titles, because you can assign prefixes to downloads when downloads are created, and assigned to a forum for display. Seems the same could be done for forum topics, maybe in a future version, it would be a great suggestion to the gurus.

How to generate and validate a software license key?,"I'm currently involved in developing a product (developed in C#) that'll be available for downloading and installing for free but in a very limited version. To get access to all the features the user has to pay a license fee and receive a key. That key will then be entered into the application to ""unlock"" the full version. As using a license key like that is kind of usual I'm wondering : I guess I should also tie the key to the version of application somehow so it'll be possible to charge for new keys in feature versions. Anything else I should think about in this scenario?Caveat: you can't prevent users from pirating, but only make it easier for honest users to do the right thing.

Assuming you don't want to do a special build for each user, then:


Generate yourself a secret key for the product
Take the user's name
Concatentate the users name and the secret key and hash with (for example) SHA1
Unpack the SHA1 hash as an alphanumeric string. This is the individual user's ""Product Key""
Within the program, do the same hash, and compare with the product key. If equal, OK.


But, I repeat: this won't prevent piracy 



I have recently read that this approach is not cryptographically very sound. But this solution is already weak (as the software itself has to include the secret key somewhere), so I don't think this discovery invalidates the solution as far as it goes.

Just thought I really ought to mention this, though; if you're planning to derive something else from this, beware.There are many ways to generate license keys, but very few of those ways are truly secure. And it's a pity, because for companies, license keys have almost the same value as real cash.

Ideally, you would want your license keys to have the following properties:


Only your company should be able to generate license keys for your products, even if someone completely reverse engineers your products (which WILL happen, I speak from experience). Obfuscating the algorithm or hiding an encryption key within your software is really out of the question if you are serious about controlling licensing. If your product is successful, someone will make a key generator in a matter of days from release.
A license key should be useable on only one computer (or at least you should be able to control this very tightly)
A license key should be short and easy to type or dictate over the phone. You don't want every customer calling the technical support because they don't understand if the key contains a ""l"" or a ""1"". Your support department would thank you for this, and you will have lower costs in this area.


So how do you solve these challenges ?


The answer is simple but technically challenging: digital signatures using public key cryptography. Your license keys should be in fact signed ""documents"", containing some useful data, signed with your company's private key. The signatures should be part of the license key. The product should validate the license keys with the corresponding public key. This way, even if someone has full access to your product's logic, they cannot generate license keys because they don't have the private key. A license key would look like this: BASE32(CONCAT(DATA, PRIVATE_KEY_ENCRYPTED(HASH(DATA))))
The biggest challenge here is that the classical public key algorithms have large signature sizes. RSA512 has an 1024-bit signature. You don't want your license keys to have hundreds of characters.
One of the most powerful approaches is to use elliptic curve cryptography (with careful implementations to avoid the existing patents). ECC keys are like 6 times shorter than RSA keys, for the same strength. You can further reduce the signature sizes using algorithms like the Schnorr digital signature algorithm (patent expired in 2008 - good :) )
This is achievable by product activation (Windows is a good example). Basically, for a customer with a valid license key, you need to generate some ""activation data"" which is a signed message embedding the computer's hardware id as the signed data. This is usually done over the internet, but only ONCE: the product sends the license key and the computer hardware id to an activation server, and the activation server sends back the signed message (which can also be made short and easy to dictate over the phone). From that moment on, the product does not check the license key at startup, but the activation data, which needs the computer to be the same in order to validate (otherwise, the DATA would be different and the digital signature would not validate). Note that the activation data checking do not require verification over the Internet: it is sufficient to verify the digital signature of the activation data with the public key already embedded in the product.
Well, just eliminate redundant characters like ""1"", ""l"", ""0"", ""o"" from your keys. Split the license key string into groups of characters.Simple answer - No matter what scheme you use it can be cracked.
Don't punish honest customers with a system meant to prevent hackers, as hackers will crack it regardless.
A simple hashed code tied to their email or similar is probably good enough.  Hardware based IDs always become an issue when people need to reinstall or update hardware.
Good thread on the issue:
http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.82298.34When generating the key, don't forget to concatenate the version and build number to the string you calculate the hash on. That way there won't be a single key that unlocks all everything you ever released.  

After you find some keys or patches floating in astalavista.box.sk you'll know that you succeeded in making something popular enough that somebody bothered to crack. Rejoice!I'm one of the developers behind the Cryptolens software licensing platform and have been working on licensing systems since the age of 14. In this answer, I have included some tips based on experience acquired over the years.

The best way of solving this is by setting up a license key server that each instance of the application will call in order to verify a license key.

Benefits of a license key server

The advantages with a license key server is that:


you can always update or block a license key with immediate effect.
each license key can be locked to certain number of machines (this helps to prevent users from publishing the license key online for others to use).


Considerations

Although verifying licenses online gives you more control over each instance of the application, internet connection is not always present (especially if you target larger enterprises), so we need another way of performing the license key verification.

The solution is to always sign the license key response from the server using a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA or ECC (possibly better if you plan to run on embedded systems). Your application should only have the public key to verify the license key response.

So in case there's no internet connection, you can use the previous license key response instead. Make sure to store both the date and the machine identifier in the response and check that it's not too old (eg. you allow users to be offline at most 30 days, etc) and that the license key response belongs to the correct device.


  Note you should always check the certificate of license key response, even if you are connected to the internet), in order to ensure that it has not been changed since it left the server (this still has to be done even if your API to the license key server uses https)


Protecting secret algorithms

Most .NET applications can be reverse engineered quite easily (there is both a diassembler provided by Microsoft to get the IL code and some commercial products can even retrieve the source code in eg. C#). Of course, you can always obfuscate the code, but it's never 100% secure.

I most cases, the purpose of any software licensing solution is to help honest people being honest (i.e. that honest users who are willing to pay don't forget to pay after a trial expires, etc).

However, you may still have some code that you by no means want to leak out to the public (eg. an algorithm to predict stock prices, etc). In this case, the only way to go is to create an API endpoint that your application will call each time the method should be executed. It requires internet connection but it ensures that your secret code is never executed by the client machine. 

Implementation

If you don't want to implement everything yourself, I would recommend to take a look at this tutorial (part of Cryptolens)The C# / .NET engine we use for licence key generation is now maintained as open source:

https://github.com/appsoftware/.NET-Licence-Key-Generator.

It's based on a ""Partial Key Verification"" system which means only a subset of the key that you use to generate the key has to be compiled into your distributable. You create the keys your self, so the licence implementation is unique to your software.

As stated above, if your code can be decompiled, it's relatively easy to circumvent most licencing systems.I've used Crypkey in the past. It's one of many available.

You can only protect software up to a point with any licensing scheme.I don't know how elaborate you want to get

but i believe that .net can access the hard drive serial number.

you could have the program send you that and something eles ( like user name and mac address of the nic)

you compute a code based off that and email them back the key.

they will keep them from switching machines after they have the key.I strongly believe, that only public key cryptography based licensing system is the right approach here, because you don't have to include essential information required for license generation into your sourcecode.

In the past, I've used Treek's Licensing Library many times, because it fullfills this requirements and offers really good price. It uses the same license protection for end users and itself and noone cracked that until now. You can also find good tips on the website to avoid piracy and cracking.The only way to do everything you asked for is to require an internet access and verification with a server. The application needs to sign in to the server with the key, and then you need to store the session details, like the IP address. This will prevent the key from being used on several different machines. This is usually not very popular with the users of the application, and unless this is a very expensive and complicated application it's not worth it.

You could just have a license key for the application, and then check client side if the key is good, but it is easy to distribute this key to other users, and with a decompiler new keys can be generated.I've implemented internet-based one-time activation on my company's software (C# .net) that requires a license key that refers to a license stored in the server's database.  The software hits the server with the key and is given license information that is then encrypted locally using an RSA key generated from some variables (a combination of CPUID and other stuff that won't change often) on the client computer and then stores it in the registry.  

It requires some server-side coding, but it has worked really well for us and I was able to use the same system when we expanded to browser-based software.  It also gives your sales people great info about who, where and when the software is being used.  Any licensing system that is only handled locally is fully vulnerable to exploitation, especially with reflection in .NET.  But, like everyone else has said, no system is wholly secure.  

In my opinion, if you aren't using web-based licensing, there's no real point to protecting the software at all.  With the headache that DRM can cause, it's not fair to the users who have actually paid for it to suffer.You can use a free third party solution to handle this for you such as  Quantum-Key.Net It's free and handles payments via paypal through a web sales page it creates for you, key issuing via email and locks key use to a specific computer to prevent piracy. 

Your should also take care to obfuscate/encrypt your code or it can easily be reverse engineered using software such as De4dot and .NetReflector.  A good free code obfuscator is ConfuserEx wich is fast and simple to use and more effective than expensive alternatives.  

You should run your finished software through De4Dot and .NetReflector to reverse-engineer it and see what a cracker would see if they did the same thing and to make sure you have not left any important code exposed or undisguised.

Your software will still be crackable but for the casual cracker it may well be enough to put them off and these simple steps will also prevent your code being extracted and re-used.

https://quantum-key.net

How to use ConfuserEx?

https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot

https://www.red-gate.com/dynamic/products/dotnet-development/reflector/downloadI solved it by interfacing my program with a discord server, where it checks in a specific chat if the product key entered by the user exists and is still valid. In this way to receive a product key the user would be forced to hack discord and it is very difficult.Besides what has already been stated....

Any use of .NET applications are inherently breakable because of the intermediate language issues.  A simple disassembly of the .NET code will open your product to anyone.  They can easily bypass your licensing code at that point. 

You can't even use hardware values to create a key anymore.  Virtual machines now allow someone to create an image of a 'licensed' machine and run it on any platform they choose.

If it's expensive software there are other solutions.  If it's not, just make it difficult enough for the casual hacker.  And accept the fact that there will be unlicensed copies out there eventually.

How to get to the Support Tool in AdminCP to restore a theme,"Hi,



	When visiting the admin side, we get the following message ...



	[[Template core/admin/global/globalTemplate is throwing an error. This theme may be out of date. Run the support tool in the AdminCP to restore the default theme.]]



	How do we get to reset the theme?Usually, you would just revert the specific template that is mentioned, not the entire theme. But keep in mind that this error just gives a generic suggestion. (Note that is says it “may” be out of date.) Following the instruction might not actually fix the problem.



	To reset the template:



	Open it in the theme editor and click the Revert button. Keep in mind, this deletes all customization you might have added to the template.



	



	To start over with a new theme, click the Create New button on the theme page.Thanks,



	I cant actually get into the admin side at all ...

	I have updated these



	Let me know if any problems



	Ever so grateful for helping out, ThanksCould you please clarify what you were doing prior to this happening? Just want to see if this helps point me in a better direction as things look to be checking out so far.It was on an older version, To be fair hadnt had much use, so we were just looking to bring it back upto date.



	On the Update it said Designed mode was on, so had to turn off.



	In this process it advised about it copying and updating the theme files. I agreed to that bit, but didn't tick the delete file based versions.



	Processed with the update and on the Client side it all worked fine. Went to log back into the Admin side and this was unaccessible.



	I have no objections to wiping the theme, we can always setup a new one? Know the girl who did it a while ago (4 Months plus) will be chuffed at having to do it again, but its really whatever we can do to get it back up and then we can work on getting it right.

If you do not have access or are unsure how to do this, please contact your hosting provider.It seems you hadnt responded here, but the error itself looks to be wrong theme on the wrong version. Have you since resolved this as we are not seeing any problems any longer?Hi Guys,

	Appreciate we all felt this was over, but can see Marc believes it to be wrong theme on wrong version...



	Is there any way anyone can give us steps to get any default theme working on any version? 



	We can always upgrade back to current versions etc.



	We've reuploaded all files a few times, checked database etc - Appreciate we havent that many posts on the system but would be good if we could keep the content.

How to lazy load images in ListView in Android,"I am using a ListView to display some images and captions associated with those images. I am getting the images from the Internet. Is there a way to lazy load images so while the text displays, the UI is not blocked and images are displayed as they are downloaded? The total number of images is not fixed.Here's what I created to hold the images that my app is currently displaying. Please note that the ""Log"" object in use here is my custom wrapper around the final Log class inside Android.

}I made a simple demo of a lazy list (located at GitHub) with images. 


  Basic Usage 

ImageLoader imageLoader=new ImageLoader(context); ...
imageLoader.DisplayImage(url, imageView); 

  
  Don't forget to add the
  following permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml:

 <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.INTERNET""/>
 <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE""/> Please

  
  create only one instance of ImageLoader and reuse it all around your
  application. This way image caching will be much more efficient.


It may be helpful to somebody. It downloads images in the background thread. Images are being cached on an SD card and in memory. The cache implementation is very simple and is just enough for the demo. I decode images with inSampleSize to reduce memory consumption. I also try to handle recycled views correctly.I recommend open source instrument Universal Image Loader. It is originally based on Fedor Vlasov's project LazyList and has been vastly improved since then.

Multithread image loading
Possibility of wide tuning ImageLoader's configuration (thread executors, downloader, decoder, memory and disc cache, display image options, and others)
Possibility of image caching in memory and/or on the device's file system (or SD card)
Possibility to ""listen"" loading process
Possibility to customize every display image call with separated options

Android 2.0+ supportMultithreading For Performance, a tutorial by Gilles Debunne.

This is from the Android Developers Blog. The suggested code uses:


AsyncTasks.
A hard, limited size, FIFO cache.
A soft, easily garbage collect-ed cache.
A placeholder Drawable while you download.Update: Note that this answer is pretty ineffective now. The Garbage Collector acts aggressively on SoftReference and WeakReference, so this code is NOT suitable for new apps.  (Instead, try libraries like Universal Image Loader suggested in other answers.)
Thanks to James for the code, and Bao-Long for the suggestion of using SoftReference. I implemented the SoftReference changes on James' code. Unfortunately, SoftReferences caused my images to be garbage collected too quickly. In my case, it was fine without the SoftReference stuff, because my list size is limited and my images are small.
There's a discussion from a year ago regarding the SoftReferences on google groups: link to thread. As a solution to the too-early garbage collection, they suggest the possibility of manually setting the VM heap size using dalvik.system.VMRuntime.setMinimumHeapSize(), which is not very attractive to me.

    drawableMap = new HashMap<String, SoftReference<Drawable>>();

public Drawable fetchDrawable(String urlString) {

            return drawable;
        // Reference has expired so remove the key from drawableMap
        drawableMap.remove(urlString);
    }

}Picasso
Use Jake Wharton's  Picasso Library.
(A Perfect ImageLoading Library from the developer of ActionBarSherlock)
A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android.
Images add much-needed context and visual flair to Android applications. Picasso allows for hassle-free image loading in your application—often in one line of code!
Picasso.with(context).load(""http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png"").into(imageView);

Many common pitfalls of image loading on Android are handled automatically by Picasso:
Handling ImageView recycling and download cancellation in an adapter.
Complex image transformations with minimal memory use.
Automatic memory and disk caching.
Picasso Jake Wharton's Library
Glide
Glide is a fast and efficient open-source media management framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy-to-use interface.
Glide supports fetching, decoding, and displaying video stills, images, and animated GIFs. Glide includes a flexible API that allows developers to plug into almost any network stack. By default, Glide uses a custom HttpUrlConnection based stack but also includes utility libraries plug-in to Google's Volley project or Square's OkHttp library instead.
Glide.with(this).load(""your-url-here"").into(imageView);

Glide's primary focus is on making scrolling any kind of a list of images as smooth and fast as possible, but Glide is also effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, and display a remote image.
Glide Image Loading Library
Fresco by Facebook
Fresco is a powerful system for displaying images in Android applications.
Fresco takes care of image loading and display, so you don't have to. It will load images from the network, local storage, or local resources, and display a placeholder until the image has arrived. It has two levels of cache; one in memory and another in internal storage.
Fresco Github
In Android 4.x and lower, Fresco puts images in a special region of Android memory. This lets your application run faster - and suffer the dreaded OutOfMemoryError much less often.
Fresco DocumentationI have followed this Android Training and I think it does an excellent job at downloading images without blocking the main UI.  It also handles caching and dealing with scrolling through many images: Loading Large Bitmaps Efficiently1.  Picasso allows for hassle-free image loading in your application—often in one line of code!
Use Gradle:
implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:(insert latest version)'

Just one line of code!
Picasso.get().load(""http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png"").into(imageView);

2. Glide An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling
Use Gradle:
repositories {
  mavenCentral() 
  google()
}

dependencies {
   implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.11.0'
   annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.11.0'
}

// For a simple view:
  Glide.with(this).load(""http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png"").into(imageView);

3. fresco  is a powerful system for displaying images in Android
applications.Fresco takes care of image loading and display, so you don't have
to.
Getting Started with FrescoI've written a tutorial that explains how to do lazy-loading of images in a listview. I go into some detail about the issues of recycling and concurrency. I also use a fixed thread pool to prevent spawning a lot of threads.

Lazy loading of images in Listview TutorialThe way I do it is by launching a thread to download the images in the background and hand it a callback for each list item.  When an image is finished downloading it calls the callback which updates the view for the list item.  

This method doesn't work very well when you're recycling views however.I just want to add one more good example, XML Adapters. As it's is used by Google and I am also using the same logic to avoid an OutOfMemory error. 

Basically this ImageDownloader is your answer (as it covers most of your requirements). Some you can also implement in that.This is a common problem on Android that has been solved in many ways by many people.  In my opinion the best solution I've seen is the relatively new library called Picasso.  Here are the highlights:


Open source, but headed up by Jake Wharton of ActionBarSherlock fame.
Asynchronously load images from network or app resources with one line of code
Automatic ListView detection
Automatic disk and memory caching
Can do custom transformations
Lots of configurable options
Super simple API
Frequently updatedI have been using NetworkImageView from the new Android Volley Library com.android.volley.toolbox.NetworkImageView, and it seems to be working pretty well. Apparently, this is the same view that is used in Google Play and other new Google applications. Definitely worth checking out.


Google I/O 2013 volley image cache tutorial
Developers Google eventsWell, image loading time from the Internet has many solutions. You may also use the library Android-Query. It will give you all the required activity. Make sure what you want to do and read the library wiki page. And solve the image loading restriction.

This is my code:

@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    View v = convertView;
    if (v == null) {
        LayoutInflater vi = (LayoutInflater)getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        v = vi.inflate(R.layout.row, null);
    }

    ImageView imageview = (ImageView) v.findViewById(R.id.icon);
    AQuery aq = new AQuery(convertView);

    String imageUrl = ""http://www.vikispot.com/z/images/vikispot/android-w.png"";

    aq.id(imageview).progress(this).image(imageUrl, true, true, 0, 0, new BitmapAjaxCallback() {
        @Override
        public void callback(String url, ImageView iv, Bitmap bm, AjaxStatus status) {
            iv.setImageBitmap(bm);
        }
    ));

    return v;
}


It should be solve your lazy loading problem.I think this issue is very popular among Android developers, and there are plenty of such libraries that claims to resolve this issue, but only a few of them seems to be on the mark. AQuery is one such library, but it is better than most of them in all aspects and is worth trying for.You must try this Universal Loader is best.
I am using this after done many RnD on lazy loading .

Universal Image Loader

Features


Multithread image loading (async or sync)
Wide customization of ImageLoader's configuration (thread executors, downloader, decoder, memory and disk cache, display image options, etc.)
Many customization options for every display image call (stub images, caching switch, decoding options, Bitmap processing and displaying, etc.)
Image caching in memory and/or on disk (device's file system or SD card)
Listening loading process (including downloading progress)


Android 2.0+ supportHave a look at Shutterbug, Applidium's lightweight SDWebImage (a nice library on iOS) port to Android.
It supports asynchronous caching, stores failed URLs, handles concurrency well, and helpful subclasses are included.

Pull requests (and bug reports) are welcome, too!DroidParts has ImageFetcher that requires zero configuration to get started.


Uses a disk & in-memory Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
Efficiently decodes images.
Supports modifying bitmaps in background thread.
Has simple cross-fade.
Has image loading progress callback.


Clone DroidPartsGram for an example:Novoda also has a great lazy image loading library and many apps like Songkick, Podio, SecretDJ and ImageSearch use their library.

Their library is hosted here on Github and they have a pretty active issues tracker as well. Their project seems to be pretty active too, with over 300+ commits at the time of writing this reply.Just a quick tip for someone who is in indecision regarding what library to use for lazy-loading images:

There are four basic ways.


DIY => Not the best solution but for a few images and if you want to go without the hassle of using others libraries
Volley's Lazy Loading library => From guys at android. It is nice and everything but is poorly documented and hence is a problem to use.
Picasso: A simple solution that just works, you can even specify the exact image size you want to bring in. It is very simple to use but might not be very ""performant"" for apps that has to deal with humongous amounts of images.
UIL: The best way to lazy load images. You can cache images(you need permission of course), initialize the loader once, then have your work done. The most mature asynchronous image loading library I have ever seen so far.If you want to display Shimmer layout like Facebook there is a official facebook library for that. FaceBook Shimmer Android

It takes care of everything, You just need to put your desired design code in nested manner in shimmer frame.
Here is a sample code.

<com.facebook.shimmer.ShimmerFrameLayout
     android:id=“@+id/shimmer_view_container”
     android:layout_width=“wrap_content”
     android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
     shimmer:duration=""1000"">

 <here will be your content to display />

</com.facebook.shimmer.ShimmerFrameLayout>


And here is the java code for it.

ShimmerFrameLayout shimmerContainer = (ShimmerFrameLayout) findViewById(R.id.shimmer_view_container);
shimmerContainer.startShimmerAnimation();


Add this dependency in your gradle file.

implementation 'com.facebook.shimmer:shimmer:0.1.0@aar'


Here is how it looks like.Check my fork of LazyList. Basically, I improve the LazyList by delaying the call of the ImageView and create two methods:


When you need to put something like ""Loading image...""
When you need to show the downloaded image.


I also improved the ImageLoader by implementing a singleton in this object.All above code have their own worth but with my personal experience just give a try with Picasso.

Picasso  is a library specifically for this purpose, in-fact it will manage cache and all other network operations automatically.You will have to add library in your project and just write a single line of code to load image from remote URL.

Please visit here : http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/android-sdk-working-with-picasso--cms-22149Use the glide library. It worked for me and will work for your code too.It works for both images as well as gifs too. 

ImageView imageView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.test_image); 
    GlideDrawableImageViewTarget imagePreview = new GlideDrawableImageViewTarget(imageView);
    Glide
            .with(this)
            .load(url)
            .listener(new RequestListener<String, GlideDrawable>() {
                @Override
                public boolean onException(Exception e, String model, Target<GlideDrawable> target, boolean isFirstResource) {                       
                    return false;
                }

                @Override
                public boolean onResourceReady(GlideDrawable resource, String model, Target<GlideDrawable> target, boolean isFromMemoryCache, boolean isFirstResource) {
                    return false;
                }
            })
            .into(imagePreview);
}I can recommend a different way that works like a charm: Android Query.

You can download that JAR file from here

AQuery androidAQuery = new AQuery(this);


As an example:

androidAQuery.id(YOUR IMAGEVIEW).image(YOUR IMAGE TO LOAD, true, true, getDeviceWidth(), ANY DEFAULT IMAGE YOU WANT TO SHOW);


It's very fast and accurate, and using this you can find many more features like animation when loading, getting a bitmap (if needed), etc.Give Aquery a try. It has amazingly simple methods to load and cache images asynchronously.URLImageViewHelper is an amazing library that helps you to do that.public class ImageDownloader {

}I had this issue and implemented lruCache. I believe you need API 12 and above or use the compatiblity v4 library. lurCache is fast memory, but it also has a budget, so if you're worried about that you can use a diskcache... It's all described in Caching Bitmaps.

I'll now provide my implementation which is a singleton I call from anywhere like this:

//Where the first is a string and the other is a imageview to load.

DownloadImageTask.getInstance().loadBitmap(avatarURL, iv_avatar);


Here's the ideal code to cache and then call the above in getView of an adapter when retrieving the web image:

public class DownloadImageTask {

    private LruCache<String, Bitmap> mMemoryCache;

    /* Create a singleton class to call this from multiple classes */

    private static DownloadImageTask instance = null;

    public static DownloadImageTask getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new DownloadImageTask();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    //Lock the constructor from public instances
    private DownloadImageTask() {

        // Get max available VM memory, exceeding this amount will throw an
        // OutOfMemory exception. Stored in kilobytes as LruCache takes an
        // int in its constructor.
        final int maxMemory = (int) (Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory() / 1024);

        // Use 1/8th of the available memory for this memory cache.
        final int cacheSize = maxMemory / 8;

        mMemoryCache = new LruCache<String, Bitmap>(cacheSize) {
            @Override
            protected int sizeOf(String key, Bitmap bitmap) {
                // The cache size will be measured in kilobytes rather than
                // number of items.
                return bitmap.getByteCount() / 1024;
            }
        };
    }

    public void loadBitmap(String avatarURL, ImageView imageView) {
        final String imageKey = String.valueOf(avatarURL);

        final Bitmap bitmap = getBitmapFromMemCache(imageKey);
        if (bitmap != null) {

How to measure software development performance? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 6 years ago. I am looking after some ways to measure the performance of a software development team. Is it a good idea to use the build tool? We use Hudson as an automatic build tool. I wonder if I can take the information from Hudson reports and obtain from it the progress of each of the programmers.The main problem with performance metrics like this, is that humans are VERY good at gaming any system that measures their own performance to maximize that exact performance metric - usually at the expense of something else that is valuable.

Lets say we do use the hudson build to gather stats on programmer output. What could you look for, and what would be the unintended side effects of measuring that once programmers are clued onto it?


Lines of code (developers just churn out mountains of boilerplate code, and other needless overengineering, or simply just inline every damn method)
Unit test failures (don't write any unit tests, then they won't fail)
Unit test coverage (write weak tests that exercise the code, but don't really test it properly)
Number of bugs found in their code (don't do any coding, then you won't get bugs)
Number of bugs fixed (choose the easy/trivial bugs to work on)
Actual time to finish a task based against their own estimate (estimate higher to give more room)


And it goes on.

The point is, no matter what you measure, humans (not just programmers) get very good at optimizing to meet exactly that thing.

So how should you look at the performance of your developers? Well, that's hard. And it involves human managers, who are good at understanding people (and the BS they pull), and can look at each person subjectively in the context of who/where/what they are to figure out if they are doing a good job or not.

What you do once you've figured out who is/isn't performing is a whole different question though.

(I can't take credit for this line of thinking. It's originally from Joel Spolsky. Here and here)Do NOT measure the performance of each individual programmer simply using the build tool. You can measure the team as a whole, sure, or you can certainly measure the progress of each programmer, but you cannot measure their performance with such a tool. Some modules are more complicated than others, some programmers are tasked with other projects, etc. It's not a recommended way of doing this, and it will encourage programmers to write sloppy code so that it looks like they did the most work.No.

Metrics like that are doomed to failure. Different people work on different parts of the code, on different classes of problem, and absolute measurements are misleading at best.

The way to measure developer performance is to have excellent managers that do their job well, have good specs that accurately reflect requirements, and track everyone's progress carefully against those specs.

It's hard to do right.  A software solution won't work.I think this needs a very careful approach when deciding the ways to measure developers performance as most the traditional methods such as line of codes, number of check ins, number of bugs fixed etc. are proven to be subjective with todays software engineering concepts. We need to value team performance approach rather measuring individual KPIs in a project. However working in commercial development environment its important to keep a track and a close look at following factors of individual developers;


Code review comments – Each project, we can decide the number of code reviews need to be conducted for a given period. Based on the code reviews individuals get remarks about their coding standard improvements. Recurring issues of code reviews of same individual’s code needs to be brought in to attention. You can use automated code reviews tools or manual code reviews.
Test coverage and completeness of tests. – The % covered needs to be decided upfront and if certain developer fails to attempt it often, it needs to be taken care of. 
Willingness to sign in to complex tasks and deliver them without much struggle
Achieving what’s defined as “Done” in a user story
Mastery level of each technical area.


With agile approach in some of the projects, the measurements of the development team and the expected performance are decided based on the releases. At each release planning there are different ‘contracts’ negotiated with the team members for the expected performance. I find this approach is more successful as there is no reason of adhering to UI related measurements in a release where there is a complex algorithm to be released.I would NOT recommend using build tool information as a way to measure the performance / progress of software developers.  Some of the confounding problems: possibly one task is considerably harder than another; possibly one task is much more involved in ""design space"" than ""implementation space""; possibly (probably) the more efficient solution is the better solution, but that better solution contributes less lines of code than a terribly inefficient one which provides many many more lines of code; etc.Speaking of KPI in software developers. www.smartKPIs.com may be a good resource for you. It contains a user friendly library of well-documented performance measures.  At the moment it lists over 3300 KPI examples, grouped in 73 functional areas, as well as 83 industries and sub-categories.

KPI examples for the software developers are available on this page www.smartKPIs.com - application development   They include but not limited to:


Defects removal efficiency
Data redundancy


In addition to examples of performance measures, www.smartKPIs.com also contains a catalogue of performance reports that illustrate the use of KPIs in practice.
Examples of such reports for information technology are available on: www.smartKPIs.com - KPIs in practice - information technology 
The website is updated daily with new content, so check it from time to time for additional content.

Please note that while examples of performance measures are useful to inform decisions, each performance measure needs to be selected and customized based on the objectives and priorities of each organisation.You would probably do better measuring how well your team tracks to schedules.  If a team member (or entire team) is consistantly late, you will need to work with them to improve performance.Don't short-cut or look for quick and easy ways to measure performance/progress of developers.  There are many many factors that affect the output of a developer.  I've seen alot of people try various metrics ...

Lines of code produced - encourages developers to churn out inefficient garbage
Complexity measures - encourages over analysis and refactoring
Number of bugs produced - encourages people to seek out really simple tasks and to hate your testers
... the list goes on.

When reviewing a developer you really need to look at how good their work is and define ""good"" in the context of what the comany needs and what situations/positions the company has put that indivual in.  Progress should be evaluated with equal consideration and thought.There are many different ways of doing this. Entire books written on the subject. You could use reports from Hudson but I think that would lead to misinformation and provide crude results. Really you need to have task tracking methodology.Check how many lines of the codes each has written.

Then fire the bottom 70%.. NO 90%!... EVERY DAY!

(for the folks that aren't sure, YES, I am joking. Serious answer here)We get 360 feedback from everyone on the team.  If all your team members think you are crap, then you probably are.There is a common mistake that many businesses make when setting up their release management tool. The Salesforce release management toolkit is one of the best ones available in the market today, but if you do not follow the vital steps of setting it up, you will definitely have some very bad results. You will get to use it but not to its full capacity. Establishing release management processes in isolation from the business processes is one of the worst mistakes to make. Release management tools go hand in hand with the enterprise strategy, objectives, governance, change management plus some other aspects. The processes of release management need to be formed in such a way that everyone in the business is on the same page.

Goals of release management
The main goal of release management is to have a consistent set of reliable and repeatable processes that are resource independent. This enables the achievement of the most favorable business value while at the same time optimizing the utilization of resources available. Considering that most organizations focus on running short, high-yield business projects, it is essential for optimization of the delivery value chain of the application to make certain that there are no holdups in the delivery of the business value.

Take for instance the force.com migration toolkit, as this tool has proven to be great in governance. A release management tool should allow for optimal visibility and accountability in governance.

Processes and release cycles
The release management processes must be consistent for the whole business. It is necessary to have streamlined and standardized processes across the various tool users. This is because they will be using the same platform and resources that enable efficient completion of their tasks. Having different processes for different divisions of your business can lead to grievous failures in tool management. The different sets of users will need to have visibility into what the others are doing. As aforementioned, visibility is of great importance in any business process.

When it comes to the release cycles, it is also imperative to have one centralized system that will track all the requirements of the different sets of users. It is also necessary to have this system centralized so that software development teams get insight into the features and changes requested by the business. Requests have to become priorities to make sure that the business gets to enjoy maximum benefit. Having a steering team is important because it is involved in the reviewing of business requirements plus also prioritizing the most appropriate changes that the business needs to make.

The changes that should happen to the Salesforce system can be very tricky and therefore having a regular meet up between the business and IT is good. This will help to determine the best changes to make to the system that will benefit the business. By considering the cost and value of implementing a feature, the steering committee has the task of deciding on the most important feature changes to make. 
 Here also good research http://intersog.com/blog/tech-tips/how-to-manage-millennials-on-software-development-teamsThis is an old question but still, something you can do is borrow Velocity from Agile Software Development, where you assign a weight to each task and then you calculate how much ""weight"" you solve in each sprint (or iteration or whatever DLC you use). Of course this comes in hand with the fact that, like a commenter mentioned before, you need to actively keep track yourself of whether your developers are working or chatting online.

If you know your developers are working responsively, then you can rely on that velocity to give you an estimate of how much work the team can do. If at any iteration this number drops (considerably), then either it was poorly estimated or the team worked less.

Ultimately, the use of KPIs together with velocity can give you per-developer (or per-team) insights on performance.Typically, directly using metrics for performance measurement is considered a Bad Idea, and one of the easy ways to run a team into the ground.

Now, you can use metrics like % of projects completed on-time, % of churn as code goes toward completion, etc...it's a wide field.

Here's an example:

60% of mission-critical bugs were written by Joe. That's a simple, straightforward metric. Fire Joe, right?

But wait, there's more!

Joe is the Senior Developer. He's the only guy trusted to write ultra-reliable code, every time. He's written about 80% of the mission-critical software, because he's the best. 

Metrics are a bad measurement of developers.I would share my experience and how I learnt a very valuable process on measuring the team performance. I must admit, I have fallen on tracking KPI simply because most of the departments would do the same but not really for the insight until I had the responsibility to evaluate developers performance where after a number of reading I evolved with the following solution.

One every project, I would entertain the team in a discussion on the project requirements and involve them so everyone knows what is to be done. In the same discussion through collaboration we would break the projects in to tasks and weight those tasks. Now previously we would estimate the project completion as 100% where each task has a percentage contribution. Well this did work for a while but was not the best solution. Now we would based the task on weight or points to be exact and use relative measurements to compare the task and differentiate the weights for example. There is a requirement to develop a web form to gather user data.
Task would go about like

 1. User Interface - 2 Points
 2. Database CRUD  - 5 Points
 3. Validation     - 4 Points
 4. Design (css)   - 3 Points


With this strategy We can pin point a weekly approximate on how much we have completed and what is pending on the task force. We can also be able to pin point who has performed best.

I must admit that I still face some challenges on this strategy such as not every developer is comfortable on every technology. Somehow some are excited to learn technologies simply because they find 2015 high % of points fall in that section some would do what they can.

Remember, do not track a KPI for their own sake, track it for it's insight.",,,,,1,2341,76.75,47.15,24.7,49.64,20.54,26.27,84.28,63.73,51.52,9.14,4.31,0.85,0.51,1.71,0.13,0.94,4.83,14.69,7.6,1.24,14.52,8.71,4.27,5.72,1.2,14.69,6.32,4.53,5.72,1.84,2.73,1.2,15.76,0.85,14.91,4.14,2.61,2.56,2.39,0.85,3.84,0.04,3.25,2.52,0.6,0.94,0.68,0.26,0,0.04,0,0.13,7.86,3.33,1.2,0.13,0,0.04,1.07,5,0.04,0,0,0.17,1.2,0.13,0,1.07,7.52,0.13,0.04,7.09,0.9,0,0.3,0.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.28,0.04,0.77,0,0.26,0,0.21,0.04,0.43,5.55,6.32,0.68,1.07,4.49,0.51,0,0.09,2.65,1.45,5.72,0.85,0.13,0.09,0.04,0,0,14.69,5.94,2.95,0.21,0.13,1.2,4.27,
How to modify database address,"Hello!



	As per title..



	Thanks



	RiccardoNot sure what you mean by database address.  If you are trying to change your database server info (host/IP) and/or database username and password...  that info would be in your conf_global.php file.  



	$INFO = array (

	  'sql_host' => 'XXXXXX',

	  'sql_database' => 'YYYY',

	  'sql_user' => 'ZZZZ',

	  'sql_pass' => 'AAAA',

	  'sql_port' => 3306,I'm not sure what you are meaning by that. Or if you are trying to modify the current database name, like @Randy Calvert said, follow this steps.


	1. Connect in your FTP.

	2. Go to File Manager » public_html » Where your IPS Suite is Installed and than find conf_global.php

	3. Right click on conf_global.php than press edit. And there you should have all the database informations you need.


	After you opened it, It should look like this.

	 


<?php

$INFO = array (
  'sql_host' => 'localhost',
  'sql_database' => 'database_name',
  'sql_user' => 'database_user',
  'sql_pass' => 'database_password',
  'sql_port' => 1111,
  'sql_socket' => '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock',
  'sql_tbl_prefix' => '',
  'sql_utf8mb4' => true,
  'board_start' => 69696969,
  'installed' => true,
  'base_url' => 'https://yourcommunityname.com/',
  'guest_group' => 1,

	2. Go to File Manager » public_html » Where your IPS Suite is Installed and than find conf_global.php

	3. Right click on conf_global.php than press edit. And there you should have all the database informations you need.


	After you opened it, It should look like this.

	 


<?php

  'sql_database' => 'database_name',
  'sql_user' => 'database_user',
  'sql_pass' => 'database_password',

How to proceed to make a software which tracks the function calls of another software?,"I wish to make a software which tracks the function calls of another software.
 
It should be like which function is being called from where ""during run time"". Example: Assuming I wish to write this currently in C for C, how should I keep a track of the calls at run time (starting from the first call) - with threads and without threads? Hints?You can do this before runtime by static analysis, or at runtime by dynamic analysis.

You have only two ways to do this at runtime, and they both amount to instrumenting code:

Instrument the source code

Modify (""instrument"") the source code so it keeps track of what you want, e.g., modify
every call site to pass an additional argument effectively containing the calling function name, and every function entry to record the entry to that function (e.g., effectively the called function name) and the calling function name.  The instrumentation process needs to build a cross-reference from points that are instrumented, back to source file and line to enable later reporting.

You can do this in a completely automated way by using a Program Transformation System (PTS), which can parse source code to make ASTs, modify the ASTs, and then regenerate source.  Often a PTS will let you write the changes as source-level patterns of the form, ""if you see this, replace it by that"".  (No, regexes can't do this). 

An extended example of how do this can be found in my technical paper, Branch Coverage for Arbitrary Languages.  The paper shows discusses what is in a PTS, and then shows typical instrumentation transformations.   

Getting this done ""right"" for a language like C can be difficult, because you need as a foundation, a full C parser, which is a major technical feat in its own right.  Best to get such a beast in completed form  (some of the PTS have this, consider Concinnelle or DMS) or you'll never get around to doing the instrumentation part.  (Another answer suggests that GCC has much of this instrumentation functionality built-in).

Done reasonably, the execution cost of the additional instrumentation is pretty modest (10-30%).   This concept has been used to implement test coverage tools and timing profilers, which operate by tracking the dynamic set of calls, which seems to be exactly what you want.

Instrument the object code

Modify the execution engine that runs the code to keep track of the details you want.  Given that you want to do this with C programs, the execution engine is essentially the underlying instruction set.  

Since you can't reasonably modify the processor chip itself, you'll have to either:


modify the object code (using object-code equivalents of program transformations, see preceding paragraph for concepts, or see tools like PIN and Valgrind for details of implementation),
or write some kind of clever instruction set interpreter that collects the information it needs as it encounters call-instructions (this is likely to be rather slow, because of its interpretive nature).


Implementing these for real instruction sets is complicated by the instruction sets themselves (Intel's X86 instruction set is huge), object file formats, etc.  Don't expect this path to be easier than the source instrumentation path; just expect it to have a different set of problems.

One standard problem is knowing what to instrument; the object code space is full of code (libraries, system routines, ...) that aren't part of the application of interest, and thus aren't interesting to collect test coverage data for.  For this, you need a symbol table ( pairs) to tell what is application code, and what is not.  You also need to be able to trace from the name to a point in the original source file(s),
in order to report the results.

One other difficulty with object code instrumentation is that it is difficult to tell if a function foo, which has been inlined, has been executed (""covered"").  The source instrumentation scheme does not have this problem, because foo gets instrumented before it gets compiled/inlined, so the instrumentation gets inlined too.

Threads

Handling threads is an orthogonal issue.  At each place where you record a fact X-calls-Y, you simply attach the thread ID (or its equivalent) T, obtained from the OS, to produce X-calls-Y-in-T.  It isn't clear from your question why you want to do this.

Static Analysis

You could decide to skip all the hassles of runtime implementation, and build/get a static analyzer that can produce a call graph.   Getting of these for C might be possible using Clang or DMS.   Building it yourself is likely difficult; now you need a full C parser, complete data flow and points-to analysis, and call-graph construction. The details won't fit in this paragraph.This is very much platform dependent. What you need is to do more or less what a debugger does.

The way I'd approach this (I actually implemented all this once when I had to debug tools needed to build gdb on an new architecture):

Read the symbol table of the program you want to debug. You said Linux in a comment, so to start you need a library that reads ELF files or read the ELF specification and implement something yourself.

Use the ptrace syscall to create a breakpoint at the function main. If you're lucky, your system has a ptrace facility to create breakpoints and keeps the bookkeeping in the kernel. If it doesn't, you need to figure out the breakpoint instruction for your cpu architecture and implement breakpoints yourself.

Next, you need to figure out the debugging hooks in your dynamic loader so that you know when shared libraries are loaded. You'll need the symbol tables of the libraries as well. 

Now that you have all the symbols (admittedly this is after your program has run for a while, since it had to load the dynamic libraries, but we'll pretend that the program starts at main) create breakpoints at all functions you've gotten from the symbol table.

Let the program run. Every time you hit a breakpoint, reverse look up the instruction pointer in the symbol table. Save the name of the function to a file or wherever you want to save it. You can now track function calls.

Or just use a debugger. gdb can probably be scripted to do something like this.I apologize that these are not open source tools, but I have used them for research in the past and they enable the functionality you require, so you might get some hints from playing with them.

On Linux, try taking a look at how Pin works.

On Windows, look at Detours.I would use the instrumentation functionality built into GCC to do the source-code instrumentation for you. 

Here is a link for a tutorial: http://balau82.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/trace-and-profile-function-calls-with-gcc/

Basically you tell the program to call an instrumentation-function before each function call and give two addresses as parameters.
You provide that instrumentation-function yourself, and it gets called with an from-address and a to-address.
The from-address tells you where the function at the to-address is being called from.

You then need to translate the addresses into function names (which can be done given line-numbers in a source-code file).
By using the GNU binutils tool addr2line you can convert the to- and from-address to line numbers, given the binary file was compiled with debug information (gcc -g ...).

It is very fast to get started with instrumentation using this approach.

EDIT:

If you do not have the source and only the binaries at hand, you can try disassembling or parsing the binaries into assembly. This way you can separate the program into logic blocks which are jumped to/from.
Function names cannot easily be recovered without the source-code, so you can risk to only be able to track jumps within the logic blocks you've previously divided the program into.
This is what several debuggers do AFAIK.
I think OllyDbg (Windows only) and IDA pro can give a visual flow chart sorta, or show a colored block-diagram or something like that.
You're really having to work hard without the source, whereas if you have the source code at hand, you have all means of doing exactly what you want. Adding just one step in between write code -> compile -> execute so it becomes write code -> insert instrumentation -> compile -> execute.The laborious way is inserting a printf as the first and last line of a function. Or using a debugger.
A problem could be debuggers who set all variables to 0 / null, ""solving"" bugs in the code.

How to protect your software code? [duplicate],"Very few things in a program are truly novel.  Almost everything that you are likely to put into your code, someone else could invent on their own.  Generally more easily than they could learn it by reading your code. Reading code is harder than writing it, and most programmers don't really like doing it anyway. 

So it's much more likely that they will look at your app and think ""I could do that"", then ""That's cool, I'm gonna read that code and then copy it!"".  Even if they understand it, you will still own the copyright, you still get to market first.

I recommend that you just forget about it.once someone takes a look at the
  code, they will understand it very
  easily and they can easily build it up
  themselves.


So don't give anybody the source code.


  If I want to sell this product, what
  is the guarantee that someone much
  smarter than me will reverse engineer
  the whole thing and come up with
  better product?


(a) So start selling it now and capture the market. Reverse engineering takes time, during which you are capturing market and 'mind-share'. (b) Put a provision in your licence agreement that prohibits reverse-engineering. (c) Make sure everybody who gets the product signs the agreement.


  Right now I am thinking of fragmenting
  the whole code. Adding lots of
  redundant code and tonnes of comments.


That only has a point if you're going to distribute the source code. In which case nobody even needs to reverse-engineer. They have your source code. Don't give it to them.


  Is there any software ...


There's lots of software that purports to do this job. However it is a technical solution to a business problem. All software can be reverse-engineered, because at some point or other it all has to be decrypted and de-obfuscated to the point where the CPU will understand it. At that point it is essentially plaintext. So no technical solution is formally speaking possible (short of something like code that executes in a tamper-proof HSM).

I will add that there is another business mechanism you can use to defend against business loss, which is what this is all about: price. Make the price so high that the licensees will value their copy and not permit it to be inspected, or make it so low that reverse-engineering is cost-infeasible; or make it free and make your money on the support contract.Once you actually have the knowledge and experience to write such a codebase, it will be clear to you that obfuscation is meant to deter casual IP infringement.

Someone who wants to know your code is going to know your code.

If it becomes an issue of monetary loss, the courts are your protection.

That's how it works.Someone will always be able to understand and work out your code. Heck, if you had 0 way getting to the code, even just using the system is enough for someone to be able to replicate the process.

Example: I take a jug of water and pour it into the cup, while my back is facing to another person. This other person knows that water and gravity are awesome at making things fall into other containers, so they can then work out a process of lifting a jug to let gravity (API call) work in their favour. They mightn't know exact what angle you used in your forearm and any super-sneaky cup-holding techniques you used, but they can replicate the same process and improve on it over time.

tl;dr: You can't protect code.The thing to do is invent even more wonderful things while the competition is reverse-engineering your current stuff.  It's called competing through innovation.I am not a lawyer

if you are really worried about it, to the point you are willing to invest money in it, dont protect your code (beyond something reasonable like obfuscation or encryption) but rather patent your idea and your art. Then if someone does take it, reverse engineer it and make a better process based of yours, you have legal grounds to get your money. 

There are tons of things you will have to do, include proving they took your idea (which isnt easy), but if this is the solution to world hunger and all of humanities problems its the thing to do.

Now for the downside, I will guess, and probably be 90% right that your method is:


Not patentable, for various reasons (I was amazed at the number of already patented ideas, and how difficult it was to identify original art)
Not new, or unique (i.e. there is already established art for it)
Not worth patenting because the expense far outways the benefits


An IP lawyer can tell you for sure, and the expense of a consult is not that much. Overall it will be cheaper to consult with them then to invest a lot of time in hiding code. 

Good luck.Don't even bother. If your code really ""does wonderful things"" be assured that it'll get hacked. And be it just for curiosity.There is no 100% way to protect your code from reverse engineering. What language are we talking about? If this is C/C++ then it is pretty hard to reverse engineer, more you could strip it from debugging information etc. But if this is for example Java then even if you obfuscate the code, there are some pretty cool tools (like JAD) that will reveal much of your work anyway.

Despite all of this I think you should try to change your attitude. Big companies pay a lot of money for simple solutions and it seems that nowadays service is the most important thing, not the software (hence the success of open-software based companies). So, if you have a great software don't be scared that someone might steal it, rather think how to sell it good.Is there any software which encrypts the software code, that will make debugging, troubleshooting, and understanding how the code works virtually impossible? and yet runs as usual? so that the developer can have peace of mind?


This is the totally wrong mindset IMO. What happens if you get hit by a bus? Your company goes bankrupt? All your data gets destroyed in a fire? For every single one of your customers, the value of their investment in your software will drop, and eventually reach zero, because the software can't be developed, or troubleshot, any further without you. I have seen so much money wasted that way, I think it's a horrible business model.

I earn my bread with making software myself so I know the hardships of making a living with it. Still, obfuscation can't be the way to go nowadays. Impose strict license agreements on your customers, scare the hell out of them so they don't even think about redistributing the software, but leave it open.This is futile. There is always someone smarter than you and therefore they will be able to reverse engineer your obfuscation.Usually someone smart enough to hack your code and use it in a meaningful way is smart enough to do it on their own, and probably thinks they can do it better than you did, so they won't bother stealing your stuff.

Don't worry about the people who can hack your code but not make meaningful use of it.  If you've done a good job, this can only reinforce the quality of the job you've done (think of all the crappy touchscreen phone imitators).They are going to reverse-engineer your code. Nothing can stop them.. The only thing you can do is make it harder. This ranges from obfuscating code that is inheritely ""open"" such as PHP and Javascript, all the way down to littering your code with a crap load of self-modification.In a lot of ways, I think, the thing that makes a piece of software valuable, is not the crazy technological advancement that it provides, but rather the things that we think might think of as being tertiary to the piece of software itself. Like the fact that you'll be there to support it. Or that it's provided as a web service and you'll be there to make sure the server is running. Or that it's a community, and you'll be there to moderate and build the community. 

While you may be actually selling code, the value you that your code has isn't intrinsic to the code itself, but rather derives from the features and ecosystem that surrounds your code.We don’t allow questions seeking recommendations for books, tools, software libraries, and more.

How to test scientific software?,"I'm convinced that software testing indeed is very important, especially in science. However, over the last 6 years, I never have come across any scientific software project which was under regular tests (and most of them were not even version controlled). Now I'm wondering how you deal with software tests for scientific codes (numerical computations). From my point of view, standard unit tests often miss the point, since there is no exact result, so using assert(a == b) might prove a bit difficult due to ""normal"" numerical errors. So I'm looking forward to reading your thoughts about this.Just been looking at a similar issue (google: ""testing scientific software"") and came up with a few papers that may be of interest. These cover both the mundane coding errors and the bigger issues of knowing if the result is even right (depth of the Earth's mantle?) 

http://http.icsi.berkeley.edu/ftp/pub/speech/papers/wikipapers/cox_harris_testing_numerical_software.pdf

http://www.cs.ua.edu/~SECSE09/Presentations/09_Hook.pdf (broken link; new link is http://www.se4science.org/workshops/secse09/Presentations/09_Hook.pdf)

http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/?dl_name=DianeKellyRebeccaSanders_TheChallengeOfTestingScientificSoftware_paper.pdf

I thought the idea of mutation testing described in 09_Hook.pdf (see also matmute.sourceforge.net) is particularly interesting as it mimics the simple mistakes we all make. The hardest part is to learn to use statistical analysis for confidence levels, rather than single pass code reviews (man or machine).

The problem is not new. I'm sure I have an original copy of ""How accurate is scientific software?"" by Hatton et al Oct 1994, that even then showed how different implementations of the same theories (as algorithms) diverged rather rapidly (It's also ref 8 in Kelly & Sanders paper)

--- (Oct 2019)
More recently Testing Scientific Software:  A Systematic Literature ReviewI am also in academia and I have written quantum mechanical simulation programs to be executed on our cluster. I made the same observation regarding testing or even version control. I was even worse: in my case I am using a C++ library for my simulations and the code I got from others was pure spaghetti code, no inheritance, not even functions.

I rewrote it and I also implemented some unit testing. You are correct that you have to deal with the numerical precision, which can be different depending on the architecture you are running on. Nevertheless, unit testing is possible, as long as you are taking these numerical rounding errors into account. Your result should not depend on the rounding of the numerical values, otherwise you would have a different problem with the robustness of your algorithm.

So, to conclude, I use unit testing for my scientific programs, and it really makes one more confident about the results, especially with regards to publishing the data in the end.I'm also using cpptest for its TEST_ASSERT_DELTA. I'm writing high-performance numerical programs in computational electromagnetics and I've been happily using it in my C++ programs.

I typically go about testing scientific code the same way as I do with any other kind of code, with only a few retouches, namely:


I always test my numerical codes for cases that make no physical sense and make sure the computation actually stops before producing a result. I learned this the hard way: I had a function that was computing some frequency responses, then supplied a matrix built with them to another function as arguments which eventually gave its answer a single vector. The matrix could have been any size depending on how many terminals the signal was applied to, but my function was not checking if the matrix size was consistent with the number of terminals (2 terminals should have meant a 2 x 2 x n matrix); however, the code itself was wrapped so as not to depend on that, it didn't care what size the matrices were since it just had to do some basic matrix operations on them. Eventually, the results were perfectly plausible, well within the expected range and, in fact, partially correct -- only half of the solution vector was garbled.  It took me a while to figure. If your data looks correct, it's assembled in a valid data structure and the numerical values are good (e.g. no NaNs or negative number of particles) but it doesn't make physical sense, the function has to fail gracefully.
I always test the I/O routines even if they are just reading a bunch of comma-separated numbers from a test file. When you're writing code that does twisted math, it's always tempting to jump into debugging the part of the code that is so math-heavy that you need a caffeine jolt just to understand the symbols.

HTH.The problem with your misexec.exe code is that running cmd.exe someprogram.exe doesn't start the program because cmd.exe doesn't execute arguments passed to it. But, you can tell it to by using the /C switch as seen here. In your case this should work:

    _Process.StartInfo.FileName = Environment.SystemDirectory.ToString() + ""\\cmd.exe"";
    _Process.StartInfo.Arguments = ""/C "" + Environment.SystemDirectory.ToString() + ""\\"" + UninstallDir;


Where all I did was add /C (with a space after) to the beginning of the arguments. I don't know how to get your rundll32.exe code to work, however.Your solution looks good, but keep a space before \qn:

How to update Xcode from command line,"I am trying to update Xcode from the command line.  Initially I tried running: which resulted in this message: So the question remains, is there a way to update Xcode from the command line?What you are actually using is the command to install the Xcode command line tools - xcode-select --install. Hence the error message you got - the tools are already installed.

The command you need to update Xcode is softwareupdate command [args ...]. You can use softwareupdate --list to see what's available and then softwareupdate --install -a to install all updates or softwareupdate --install <product name> to install just the Xcode update (if available). You can get the name from the list command.

As it was mentioned in the comments here is the man page for the softwareupdate tool.

2019 Update

A lot of users are experiencing problems where softwareupdate --install -a will in fact not update to the newest version of Xcode. The cause for this is more than likely a pending macOS update (as @brianlmerritt pointed out below). In most cases updating macOS first will solve the problem and allow Xcode to be updated as well.

Updating the Xcode Command Line Tools

A large portion of users are landing on this answer in an attempt to update the Xcode Command Line Tools. The easiest way to achieve this is by removing the old version of the tools, and installing the new one.

sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
xcode-select --install


A popup will appear and guide you through the rest of the process.I had the same issue and I solved by doing the following:


removing the old tools ($ sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)
install xcode command line tools again ($ xcode-select --install).


After these steps you will see a pop to install the new version of the tools.I encountered the same issue when I uninstalled the complete version of Xcode to reinstall the CLI version. My fix was:

sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineToolsAfter installing Command Line Tools (with xcode-select --install), type:

sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/


You should be able to run git now:

10:29 $ git --version
git version 2.17.2 (Apple Git-113)I got this error after deleting Xcode. I fixed it by resetting the command line tools path with sudo xcode-select -r. 

Before:

navin@Radiant ~$ /usr/bin/clang
xcrun: error: active developer path (""/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer"") does not exist
Use `sudo xcode-select --switch path/to/Xcode.app` to specify the Xcode that you wish to use for command line developer tools, or use `xcode-select --install` to install the standalone command line developer tools.
See `man xcode-select` for more details.

navin@Radiant ~$ xcode-select --install
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use ""Software Update"" to install updates


After:

navin@Radiant ~$ /usr/bin/clang
clang: error: no input filesJust type the commands
cd  /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/;
open macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg


Reference: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/104296$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
$ xcode-select --installI was facing the same problem, resolved it by using the following command.
sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
After running the above command then xcode-select -p  command showed the following.
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools@Vel Genov's answer is correct, except when the version of Xcode can't be updated because it is the latest version for your current version of Mac OS.  If you know there is a newer Xcode (for example, it won't load an app onto a device with a recent version of iOS) then it's necessary to first upgrade Mac OS.

Further note for those like me with old Mac Pro 5.1.  Upgrading to Mojave required installing the metal gpu (Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 560 in my case) but make sure only HDMI monitor is installed (not 4K!  1080 only).  Only then did install Mojave say firmware update required and shut computer down.  Long 2 minute power button hold and it all upgraded fine after that!

Catalina update - softwareupdate --install -a won't upgrade xcode from command line if there is a pending update (say you selected update xcode overnight)Xcode::Install is a simple cli software that allow you to install/select a specific Xcode version.

You can install it using gem install xcode-install

Then you will be able to install a specific version with xcversion install 9.4.1

And if you have more than one version installed, you can switch version with xcversion select 9.4

You can find more information at https://github.com/KrauseFx/xcode-installI am now running OS Big Sur. xcode-select --install, and sudo xcode-select --reset did not resolve my issue, neither did the recommended subsequent softwareupdate --install -a command. For good measure, I tried the recommended download from Apple Downloads, but the Command Line Tools downloads available there are not compatible with my OS.
I upvoted the fix that resolved for me, sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/ and added this post for environment context.I am not sure why this was so tricky for me.
sudo xcode-select --install

Did nothing for me.
softwareupdate --all --install --force

Did nothing for me.
I had to do things in the following order
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
sudo xcode-select --install

This installed a newer xcode, but not latest.
Then I did
softwareupdate --all --install --force

and they updated completely.I was trying to use the React-Native Expo app with create-react-native-app but for some reason it would launch my simulator and just hang without loading the app. The above answer by ipinak above reset the Xcode CLI tools because attempting to update to most recent Xcode CLI was not working. the two commands are:

rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
xcode-select --install


This process take time because of the download.
I am leaving this here for any other would be searches for this specific React-Native Expo fix.I was able to update via CLI using:
softwareupdate --list --verbose

and then
softwareupdate -i Command\ Line\ Tools\ for\ Xcode-13.2I was faced with this today after an update from Xcode (App Store on Mac) updated my Xcode.
My SourceTree wouldn't allow me to do a merge conflict.
In Xcode I found that Command Tools was NOT selected.
I selected it, however still no dice as I was getting the same message of:
I performed the command:

softwareupdate --list

which gave me a list of products, including THREE (3) versions of CommandLine Tools
Software Update Tool

Title: Command Line Tools for Xcode, Version: 13.4, Size: 705462K, Recommended: YES,

my version of Xcode is 13.4, so I preceded to try to update just the one.
I used the Label, with escaped spaces (which also works with just quoted label btw ""Command Line Tools for Xcode-13.4""

softwareupdate -i Command\ Line\ Tools\ for\ Xcode-13.4

In doing so, ALL 3 updates of Command Line Tools disappeared and I was able to continue.
Hope this helps someone else out there.Hello I solved it like this:

After this, no warning. Appium-doctor returned clean.xCode version 11.2.1 is necessary for building app in iPad 13.2.3, When I directly try to upgrade from xcode 11.1 to 11.2.1 through App Store it get struck, So after some research , I found a solution to upgrade by removing the existing xcode from the system

So here I am adding the steps to upgrade after uninstalling existing xcode.


  
  Go to Applications and identify Xcode and drag it to trash.
  Empty trash to permenently delete Xcode.
  Now go to ~/Library/Developer/ folder and remove the contents completely    Use sudo rm -rf  ~/Library/Developer/ to avoid any
  permission issue while deleting
  Lastly remove any cache directory associated with xcode in the path ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode    sudo rm -rf
  ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode/*
  After completing the above steps you can easly install xcode from App Store, which will install the current latest version of xcode
  


Note: Please take a backup of your existing projects before making the above changesUpdate with this one-liner.

	I found this post topic after searching and seems there was no solution at that time. Is there one now?




	Thank you



			
				


	Edited September 2 by SJ77Clicking the box at the top of the replies will check every post on that page. I know it is probably not the solution you are looking for but it will reduce the ""1 by 1"" option by a factor of 19. If it were me and I had to do it that way, I would do the last 10/20 (20 clicks will move 400 posts) pages or so first just to get the split thread started and the discussion can continue, in context. When you move the rest, it will update as the move progresses.


	Additionally, by working backwards, it enables you to select all posts on the page, until you get to that cutoff point. You're probably locking the thread with the first 7500 posts anyways so, you could do it at your leisure after you get the secondary thread started.

	Again, just me and what I might do in this scenario...


	Select the last 20 or so pages (prior to those on a partial page load), just before where you want it to pick up, split them off into a different thread, lock the newly created thread for however long it takes you to move the prior posts from a partial listing page (and then opening the newly locked thread), so it can continue on in that context. Then as you get time, move the rest of the prior posts. At which point you will want to work forward so you get to select entire pages of posts.

IOS photos are uploaded upside down,"Hi all,



	We have a problem on our phorum - some of the pictures taken with an iPhone and uploaded directly, are disoriented. now I read the thread attached.



	Is there a proper intuitive solution to this problem where I don't need to educate members?



	Thanks.As long as the PHP EXIF extension is installed, photos should be reoriented automatically.We also have the problem.

	ACP -> System -> Support -> System Check (top right). Will list all installed extensions in green and as EXIF is optional if you do not have it installed should be in grey.Thank you, Jim, it is installed. But the pictures are sometimes upside down.Are you using GD or ImageMagick for image processing (AdminCP > System > Files > Image Settings)? If you switch to the other method (if available), do you have the same problem still?Yes, I've tried that before.I'm not sure if the soft does actually fix the above issue but, the main reason this happens is that people don't allow the camera to change its orientation before taking a picture.


	It's something I've had to explain to my members time and time again. Let's say you're in portrait mode and then quickly turn the phone to landscape and take a picture. If you look at the screen you'll notice the words/details on the screen are not at the right orientation. I still get caught out by this on my iPhone 8 and iPhone XS Max at times.



	So, if I have taken the picture and I've noticed it's sideways when uploading, I simply go to Photo's, edit the picture and rotate it once, save it and then rotate it again until it's in the correct orientation and then save it. Now when I go to upload it, the photo is facing the correct way. This issue has been around a very long time. It's even worse when the phone is actually upside down (buttons on the bottom of the phone) as you don't realise you've turned it this way and go to take a picture.


	I hope this helps others who face this issue as it's not IPS's software that is at fault. ☺️Is there any update to this? I know that we have had this ""fixed"" before, but after a recent server or software update, this has started happening frequently again.Having the same issue on my board. Exif is installed. Using GD. Thoughts?You would need to check this with your server host, as if you have exif installed and its not reorienting them properly, its an issue with exif on the server.I am the host 🙂



	This is what phpinfo() is showing me. Claims exif is enabled.I can tell you only that its exif which actually rotates these correctly. Are you able to replicate the problem here in the test area?On 2/16/2022 at 9:34 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

	Not sure what you mean re: recreate in test area - try to upload the images here?



	Is there something I need to do to have IPB rotate the photos after they have been uploaded? I'm modifying php config and want to see if it has fixed exif.I think Marc means upload a test in the test forum here

	Yes, thats correct 🙂Thanks @Marc Stridgen.



	Is there anything I need to do to get the board to rotate images that have already been uploaded?



	I seem to recall in previous versions of the software there was a way to force it to re-scan the uploads and fix. I cannot find it in current.There is no wya in which to do this retroactively unfortunately. It would only work for items going forwardHad member upload photo again - still upside down. Tried uploading image here in test forum, upside down.



	EXIF is installed and showing enabled in phpinfo().



	Thoughts?That would indicate an issue with the image itself. Please could you zip the image (so that I get the image actually being uploaded before processing), and upload it here.I'll ask the member if they can zip / send me the photo. They are taking and uploading with an iPhone 12 so they may not be able to zip it.On 2/23/2022 at 9:09 AM,   autumnwalker said:

	No problem. If its not being rotated, its very likely the photo itself. Also ask them to upload elsewhere and see if it shows the correct way.@Marc Stridgen I sent you a message with the photo in a zip.The image you have sent over there is an heic file, which would not actually be displayed by the software at all.

IP range used by remoteservices.invisionpower.com?,"Hi,

	We are configuring new development and staging environments of our forum and since both environments are restricted to only our IPs, we struggle to sign in to Invision Marketplace from the Admin CP.


	I'm already familiar with the solution in this topic but if possible, I would need to know the IP range used by remoteservices.invisionpower.com.

			We successfully tried allowing one IP a couple of months ago but changing the setup every time the IP changes is not a long term solution.
		
	



	This is actually the reason you need to allow the domain name and not the IP associated with it. This can change at any point, and there is no guarentee of that being within a set range.Thanks for the reply. Yeah, we figured that the IP is dynamically changing but the IP range should still be fixed.


	We'll look into how to allow that domain instead but unfortunately it seems way more complex to configure that in our current setup in AWS WAF compared to just allowing an IP range.What I ended up doing was white listing all of AWS’s EC2 IP ranges (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html).

IPS 4.7.1 and ElasticSearch 7.17.4 -- precise exact match vs loose match,"This may not be an IPS configuration.  In fact I think it is probably outside of IPS configuration, but Elastic Search is a selectable feature for driving search.



	Since Elastic Search is a configurable choice to use for driving search results, this issue came up.



	When a user searched for a term, what happened was that the ES query turned out results that matched similar words.   This was not intended.  So the question I'm asking is, for those who have integrated ES into their IPS for search, did you customize the ES back-end to tune the search to be verbatim search?



	Here's an example of what we saw in a live-site:



	The observation was that a term was searched: ""Dominators""  (this term means something specific to the Members and the Content of the site).



	What the ES/IPS search did was look for matches on these:



	With and without double quotes return a lot of posts with dominant, dominance, dominated, etc. burying the actual content about Dominators.



	In hindsight this reminded me of old WAIS type of behavior (for those who remember WAIS...).



	I did a skim for looking for the query formation in ES and stumbled across this. 



	https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/current/verbatim-and-strict-query-usage.html



	The question again is -- is there a feature or Admin accessible configuration that can control if a Search is literally verbatim (and suppress the attempt of ES to try words -- without the user's request -- that are close-to-the term searched on) ?



	Open to ideas..  Point me in a direction that I should look if this isn't an IPS configurable thing.   Questions, ping me.  Thanks.

	It's the / in there that is causing the later problems.



	Manipulate $dir as follows, before the $skipPattern is created, will sort it. Likely going to need to be a manual edit by us if the expected cue comes along...

	Unfortunately, after disabling all your third party applications/plugins, it loads without error so one of them is creating an invalid call here. You will want to disable them then re-enable one-by-one to find the culprit then work with them to resolve the issue.

	Hi Jim



	I too have the same issue after updating my test site to v4.7.2 beta 2.



	Yes, disabling all 3rd party applications has solved the Invision Community spinning graphic but its all 6 of the applications that I have added.  Surely, they all cant have an issue, as they are all v4.7.1 compatible too.I should have added for clarity that enabling any 1 of 6 applications breaks it.Have you checked this with the authors of those applications?On 8/30/2022 at 10:22 AM,   Marc Stridgen said: 

	
		
			Have you checked this with the authors of those applications?
		
	



	No, but I will alert them.



	They are all from the same (popular) author, I'm sure they will carryout their own checks given time.  This is after all beta release, it will be interesting what @bosss and @abobader (and others) find with their 3rd party applications.Please do let us know the outcome@Marc Stridgen - nothing is being logged in the system logs when this issue occurs while 3rd party apps are enabled (other than the preq_quote issue that is logged anyway). Not much there for people to go on as to the cause...are these only applications from one specific author? I feel we need to narrow that down first of allIn the front-end, there is a HTTP 500 error coming back with a ""Something went wrong, please try again"" response.



	Off to dig into the back-end logs...Hi @Jim M 



	Yes, disable all apps/plugins solve the issue, but as I just enable back any of them, problem back again as reported by @Richard Arch 



	Also notice repeated error log about gallery and download that I do not have.

	Edited August 17 by naotriixI would suggest first of all using the check tool to make sure you have the minimum requirements. I do have to point out however, if you are using an alternative web server, we can be of only limited assistance.

	Ive tested in local too with apache there is same issue btwPlease install using PHP 7.4. Apparently there is a known issue installing with 8.0/8.1 at presentI can use to install only atm ? And then switch or i keep 7.4 thenJust to install. You can switch over afterward. PHP 8.0 may actually workI've managed to do what i want but i've a problem, when i convert from old db member_id's are reordered correctly after merge, i would like to keep same id's because i use them for my game server and its already linked can't change ^^ any idea how i can do this ?



			
				


	Edited August 17 by naotriixIt’s not possible to do by default. You would have to do this with some sort of customization and would be outside of the scope of what can be done with the base product.Yes, as Randy mentioned, when using our converters it is not possible to retain the old member ID number.Ok thanks to all i will see what i can do...You're welcome, glad we could be of assistance. 🙂You could save the member ID in a custom profile field before the import. Then when you import the members (and their custom profile field) you can use that field as game server ID rather than their core_members.member_id value.As mentioned initially, converting to another instance in order to solve problems on your existing instance, in our experience would not be the best direction.

Inactive users updating photo mysteriously,"Strangely, some users updated their photo at the same time, and none of them have logged in recently.



	From what I could observe, all these users are connected with google.Most likely it's the profilesync task updating their accounts automatically.

	I imagined that would be it, I just found it strange so many users at same time, as if it had accumulated.The task usually updates several users at once when it runs. It does a batch of them rather than a single one. From you screenshot it clearly updated 5 members 2 hours ago, then 4 member 1 hour ago and finally 1 member 10 minutes ago (I guess it was the last user that needed an updated, thus the single-member batch).



			
				


	Edited August 24 by teraßyteLooks like there's still more to update 😅If people are changing their profile pic regularly, they will always happen. You can of course remove that from the feed if you wantedMy preoccupation and if it had broken haha

	Because it's still updating a lot of users, but you're saying it's common, so that's ok.

	Edited August 25 by HisashiYes, if you recently changed a setting for profile photos then this task would of course update those related in batches.I didn't make any changes

"Incompatibility with ""service workers""","Lately, many of our iOS users reported errors on random occasions and one of the few common patterns was at the checkout stage. They all consistently failed to load the site either at the subscription page level or while checking out irrespective of Stripe or PayPal.



	We checked with one of the IPS developers who recently worked on the custom plugin for us and he confirmed that his line of codes doesn't interfere with ""service workers"".



	We have disabled the server firewall, CP Hulk (security feature of cPanel), and even disabled Cloudflare completely to point straight to the server NS record and the problem still exists.



	Then we turned to the ""WORLD BEST SUPPORT"" provider folks at Cpanel who have finally confirmed and identified that IPS JavaScript codes causing this issue.



	


	 



	Here is the full detail of the investigation and ways to replicate it by using logged-in users to checkout any subscription on any iOS device.



	 



	


	 



	 
Looking further into this, we can see a similar defect report on Safari for this issue:

	Hope to have a quick resolution or patch for this urgent incompatibility issue for over 70% of devices used within our community.While I understand you said a plugin you have doesnt interfere with the service workers, you dont seem to have confirmed here that you have tested this with it disabled. You need to ensure you have tested this completely with all 3rd party items disabled.

	You can use any iOS device and go to the homepage and click on the join now, back to the forum, back to the homepage and you will experience it failing too.



	Sure shot: You can log in and try buying the subscription and use PayPal as an option, but it will surely fail. The majority of iOS devices are failing to pay by credit card.

	Please could you expand on this? In what way is it failing? What exactly is happening?Sorry, I thought that you've read Cpanel support response. My bad.I had, however it was not clear if this was only with the pages being hit, and payments failing was something else or not. I am taking a look at this now for you.Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention! I can confirm this should be further reviewed and I have logged an internal bug report for our development team to investigate and address as necessary, in a future maintenance release.Thank you Marc, for the quick investigation and for realizing the issue with IPS codes.

Incorporating shareware restrictions in C++ software,"I wish to implement my software on a shareware basis, so that the user is
given a maximum trial period of (say) 30 days with which to try out the software. On purchase I intend the user to be given a randomly-generated key, which when entered
enables the software again. I've never been down this route before, so any advice or feedback or pointers to 'standard' ways of how this is done would be much appreciated. I do not anticipate users cheating by changing the system date or anything like that, though this is probably worth considering. Apologies if this topic has appeared before.With regards to a random-generated key, how will you verify a key is legit or if a key is bogus if it is actually random? Have a look at the article ""Implementing a Partial Serial Number Verification System"" as it is quite good and is easy to implement in any language.

With regards to time trials, as basic solution would be to compare your main executable files creation time to the current system time and act on the difference. This assumes your installer sets the files creation time to the time of install as opposed to preserving the time you compiled it! :)Also watch out for the time changing radically, if the current date is magically less than the install date and such.

One way to get around this type of datelock is to change your date before you install to be years in the future. So you should check that the date today is not less that the install date.If your software is really useful, you'll certainly find cracked copies on P2P before you see your first order. This will happen no matter how sophisticated is the license enforcement code you are going to implement. 

That said, just store first-run date somewhere (may be registry, if on Windows) and after 30 days refuse to start, or just open a reminder window. 

Don't worry about cheaters, they'll find a way around your restrictions no matter what. Worry about your honest customers and try hard not to make their life harder.

Eric Sink has written more about this here (section 4).On the first start, you can store the actual date somewhere.

Each following start, you look for the stored date, if it exist you read it an if it is more than 30 days after the first start, you stop the program.Please see this library.

Inspirations for Software UI [closed],"Do you know any source for nice looking software designs? (non Web).There is always Apple Design Awards or something like the Mobile User Experience Awards for mobile applications.There are some good examples on http://emberapp.com. Mostly for Mac though ...I would take a look at http://quince.infragistics.com/, while not complete applications, it does show you some best practices/design patterns for both Windows and Web applications.

I'd also take a look at some of the Windows Forms component companies, DevExpress, Telerik and Infragistics. You can learn a lot from the look and feel of their components.In this case... a lot of programmers tend to talk only about the worst examples...cause UI really depends on personel taste.

Install Node.js on Ubuntu,"I'm trying install Node.js on Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal), but the terminal shows me an error about lost packages. I tried with this: But when I came to the last line sudo apt-get install nodejs npm shows this error: Then I uninstalled the ppa:chris-lea/node.js and I was trying a second option: The same error, the terminal says npm is the latest version, but it also shows me the text I shown in the top. I think the problem is ppa:chris-lea/node.js, but I don't know how solve it.Simply follow the instructions given here:

Example install:
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties python g++ make
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs

It installs current stable Node on the current stable Ubuntu. Quantal
(12.10) users may need to install the software-properties-common
package for the add-apt-repository command to work: sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
As of Node.js v0.10.0, the nodejs package from Chris Lea's repo
includes both npm and nodejs-dev.

Don't give sudo apt-get install nodejs npm. Just sudo apt-get install nodejs.As of today, you can simply install it with:

sudo apt-get install nodejsnpm is automatically installed with Node.js in the latest version of Node.js. What do you see when you type node --version and npm --version in the terminal?
You can upgrade npm using npm itself as well:
[sudo] npm install -g npmMy apt-get was old and busted, so I had to install from source. Here is what worked for me:
# Get the latest version from nodejs.org. At the time of this writing, it was 0.10.24
curl -o ~/node.tar.gz http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.24/node-v0.10.24.tar.gz
cd
tar -zxvf node.tar.gz
cd node-v0.6.18
./configure && make && sudo make install

These steps were mostly taken from joyent's installation wiki.This is the best way to easyly install Node.js. This also is actual for Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail), and Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr).
Adding Node.js repositories
[sudo] apt-get install python-software-properties
[sudo] apt-add-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
[sudo] apt-get update

Node.js installation
[sudo] apt-get install nodejs

Now checking Node.js version
node -v

Outputs
v0.10.20

This command should install npm
npm install

Check npm version
npm -v

Outputs
1.4.3

If for some reason, if you see npm is not installed, you may try running:
[sudo] apt-get install npm

To update npm you may try running:
[sudo] npm install -g npmNow you can simply install with:
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm

Make sure you have the Python and C interpreters/compilers preinstalled. If not, perform:
sudo apt-get install python g++ makeYou can use nvm to install Node.js. It allows you work with different versions without conflicts.wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.19.0/install.sh | bash

nvm install v0.10.33

Just use nvm for Node.js version control - nvm.Just follow the official instructions from here to install on Ubuntu

http://jstricks.com/install-node-js/Follow the instructions given here at NodeSource which is dedicated to creating a sustainable ecosystem for Node.js.
For Node.js >= 4.X
# Using Ubuntu
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Using Debian, as root
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejsNode.js is available as a snap package in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu. Specific to Node.js, developers can choose from one or more of the currently supported releases and get regular automatic updates directly from NodeSource. Node.js versions 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 are currently available, with the Snap Store being updated within hours or minutes of a Node.js release.
Node.js can be installed with a single command, for example:
sudo snap install node --classic --channel 11/stable

The node snap can be accessed by the command node, for example:
$ node -v
v11.5.0
An up-to-date version of npm will installed as part of the node snap. npm should be run outside of the node repl, in your normal shell. After installing the node snap run the following command to enable npm update checking:
sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/<b>your-username</b>/.config

Replace  your-username in the above command with your own username. Then run npm -v to check if the version of npm is up-to-date. As an example I checked that npm was up-to-date, checked the version of an already installed package named yarn with the command npm list yarn and then updated the existing yarn package to the latest version with the command npm update yarn
Users can switch between versions of Node.js at any time without needing to involve additional tools like nvm (Node Version Manager), for example:
sudo snap refresh node --channel=11/stable

Users can test bleeding-edge versions of Node.js that can be installed from the latest edge channel by switching with:
sudo snap switch node --edge

This approach is only recommended for those users who are willing to participate in testing and bug reporting upstream.

sudo apt-get install python g++ make
wget http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz
tar xvfvz node-latest.tar.gz
cd node-v0.12.0
./configure
make
sudo make install

If you want to install particular version then download the version you want from the Node.js site and execute the last tree steps.
I would strongly suggest not using the default Node.js package from the distribution market, because it would be probably outdated (i.e., the current for the time of writing this in the Ubuntu market is v0.10.25 which is too outdated compared to the latest (v0.12.0)).Here is the full description to create the first program using the express generator,
Ubuntu's package manager
To install Node.js and npm via apt-get, run these commands:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
sudo apt-get install npm

Express application generator:
$ npm install express-generator -g

Display the command options with the -h option:
$ express -h

  Usage: express [options] [dir]

  Options:

    -h, --help          output usage information
    -V, --version       output the version number
    -e, --ejs           add ejs engine support (defaults to jade)
        --hbs           add handlebars engine support
    -H, --hogan         add hogan.js engine support
    -c, --css <engine>  add stylesheet <engine> support (less|stylus|compass|sass) (defaults to plain css)
        --git           add .gitignore
    -f, --force         force on non-empty directory

For example, the following creates an Express application named myapp in the current working directory:
$ express myapp

   create : myapp
   create : myapp/package.json
   create : myapp/app.js
   create : myapp/public
   create : myapp/public/javascripts
   create : myapp/public/images
   create : myapp/routes
   create : myapp/routes/index.js
   create : myapp/routes/users.js
   create : myapp/public/stylesheets
   create : myapp/public/stylesheets/style.css
   create : myapp/views
   create : myapp/views/index.jade
   create : myapp/views/layout.jade
   create : myapp/views/error.jade
   create : myapp/bin
   create : myapp/bin/www

Then install dependencies:
$ cd myapp
$ npm install

Run the app with this command:
$ DEBUG=myapp:* npm start

Then load http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to access the application.
The generated application has the following directory structure:
├── app.js
├── bin
│   └── www
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── images
│   ├── javascripts
│   └── stylesheets
│       └── style.css
├── routes
│   ├── index.js
│   └── users.js
└── views
    ├── error.jade
    ├── index.jade
    └── layout.jade

Please avoid installing Node.js with apt-get on Ubuntu. If you already installed Node.js with the built-in package manager, please remove that. (sudo apt-get purge nodejs && sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean)
The installation process on Linux is the same as on OS X.

$ nvm use 6.4.0
$ nvm alias default 6.4.0
$ node -v
$ npm install -g npm
$ npm -v

Other issues while installing Node JS
Do not use sudo apt-get install nodejs npm. Always use sudo apt-get install nodejs

And If you get the error sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found just run this command prior to the second one above: sudo apt-get install software-properties-common


If sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found and needed to run sudo apt-get install python-software-properties before adding the repository


try to use a bash -r if you had an old version before or node / npm does not appear in your console


The linked instructions have been updated to curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs


Edit Updated

For the latest version you can also use the URL
nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz

One more thing! Don’t forget to run the following command, which increases the amount of inotify watches.
$ echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -pIf you're looking for a simple, fast (no build process), local (no sudo) install on ubuntu, check out:

	I verify the database and all the table is there everything seems fine at this point. So now i dont know where to look at to be able to finish the installation.

	it fail at this link :  admin/install/index.php?controller=install&mr=193

	This page not working 
HTTP ERROR 500



	And when i return on the main page : 




	i wait 2h and nothing change.



	Thank youIt appears you are using NGINX, is that correct?Yesusing NGINX is that a problem ?We can provide only limits support for sites running on environments alternative to apache. 



	If you are getting an internal server error, you need to check your server error log to see what error you are hittingokk i will change to Apache 

	it just i'm more familiar with NGINX 

	I will made the change and try again and come back in this topic to let you know if it work or not 


	thank youResult


	Hi i just try to install it on Apache and i got the same problem.As mentioned above, you need to check your server error log and see what error it is you are hitting. Its an internal server error there, so this will be loggedIn resume 

	i got this in the log, In my understanding, it seems more like a script error then a server error.

	Have you ran the latest requirements checker on your server?Hey @D-Trox



	This is an issue specific to PHP 8.1 and we've got a fix coming for it in an upcoming release.the version 8.0 is alright or i need to go to the version 7.4 ?

			thank you
		
	



	8.0 should be alright but if you encounter problems, please try 7.4 and let us know.I try and i got the same problem. 

	So i uninstall php8.0 and install 7.4


	I'm not familiar with apache. 

	Now whwn i want to open the website , it reading the php file like a text file




	 



	Do you have a idea how to quickly fix that ? 

	i try alot of thing from google , i try to uninstall complettly apache and re-install it and still the same.

	So i'm trying to asking you if you already saw that and know how to fix it ? 



	thank youThat would indicate that PHP is not running or your PHP configuration is not properly working with your web server. I'm afraid, web server management such as this is outside our scope of support. You will want to work with your hosting provider or a server administrator if you are unsure.I got it 

	But now after the installation , when i try to connect , its like if i'm not existing 



	Any idea what can causing that or where looking to find the problem  ?



	thank you very much , i know i ask alot, its the first time i got so many problems



			
				


	Edited August 12 by D-TroxIt's a generic CSRF failure. Does this happen each time you try to login to the ACP? Ensure you load the login page anew and not hitting the back button or a bookmark.I'm sure to have not hit the back button or using a bookmark. 

	Now in trying to connect i'm lock for 14 minutes , but it never change haha ^^


	Its like if is not able to identify me , admin panel or the website/forum  itself

		We look forward to further assisting you.Hi 

	I update it ,let me know if it still have problem.Unfortunately, the administrator access details to your community are still invalid.To have access to the adminCP ? 


	if yes , yeah is that the problem , after the installation , i make sure to write the right code , and yeah i cannot connect anywhere .

	If you do not know the password and email is not setup yet, you would need to re-install or register a new account and change the group via the database. There is no way to get a password from the database as it is hashed.Hi


	Great , in adding a user , i give me access and give back access to my other account. 

	Now it work great.  :) 


	The only thing is with the rewrite URLs , i have put the file and is really .htaccess but ACP still says it dont see it or not seems to work. 


	i reset the client info if you want to take a lookIn the time

	Can let me know where i can find / where is save  the terms & rules Text



	In the database , cause i do not save back the text before changing and re-install the website into the other server. 

	But i do not delete the folder and the database of the old one , so i try to find where is save to copy the text.

Installer for Software? Paas?,"currently I'm looking for an open source project that gives me the opportunity to install software easily. I prefer direct calls or access with a REST interface. I thought that CloudFoundry would fits my needs but it is'nt so. 
AppFog (https://www.appfog.com/product/) comes much closer to my goal. It allows me to install Drupal, Wordpress, PhpMyAdmin, NodeJS Apps and so on. The conclusion is that I'm looking for an project that... I would be happy for all kind of hints and tips :) Cheers TobiasDocker is seems to be the next big thing in the PaaS world. There are dozens new projects that build on top of docker or supporting it. For example OpenShift and Apache Stratos support docker. So if you look at solutions based on docker you can find a solution for you needs. 
Right now I'm using docker for hosting couple of Drupal websites with simple bash scripts to manage them. Nginx is used for web traffic routing


Docker is open source
Gives you ability to prepare and install apps
You can build what you need on top of it
It has REST interface
It is running on nearly all major Linux distros
Its relatively easy to learn and use
Has great communityTobias,

Suggest you look at Apache Stratos:


100% open source
Easy to Get Up and Running
Highly extensible, flexible, expandable
Uses REST APIs  
Runs on Linux (Ubuntu or SUSE)
Mature (version 4)


See:

"IntelliJ inspection gives ""Cannot resolve symbol"" but still compiles code","Platform: IntelliJ Community Edition 10.0.3

SDK: jdk1.6.0_21

OS: Windows 7 So I have a strange situation with IntelliJ that has me completely stumped.  I setup a Maven project and add log4j as a dependency in the pom.xml file.  The IDEA inspections run fine and my unit tests all compile and run. I then added hunnysoft's jmime library to my local maven repository using the mvn install:install-file as follows. Maven installed the jar file just fine into my local repository. I then went into IntelliJ's Settings => Maven => Repository Services and Updated my local repository (so that IntelliJ would reindex the repository contents). Finally, I added the following dependency to my pom.xml file (just above the log4j dependency). I now create a new class as follows: Now for the weirdness.  IntelliJ's intention mechanism picks up and recognizes the Logger import in the maven pom file just fine.  However, for all of the hunnysoft imports it reports: ""Cannot resolve symbol 'ByteString/Field/FieldBody'"", BUT Build => Compile 'StackOverflowQuestion.java' compiles everything correctly and the unit test I created for this class runs fine (though the intentions mark the call to create() as a problem area too). So somewhere, somehow IntelliJ is ignoring the jmime.jar file for the intention subsystem.  I'm confused because the log4j dependency works fine and everything compiles and runs fine.  F12 (""Go To Declaration"") works on the Logger import, but breaks on all the jmime imports. Oh, one other thing, if I go to the 'Packages' view in the ""Projects"" window the ""com.hunnysoft.jmime"" package appears and I can see ALL of the classes I imported in the code snippet above under ""Libraries"".  Removing the above dependency from the pom.xml file causes this package to disappear and the compilation breaks. It appears that the inspection's classpath is broken, but there does not seem to be a setting for this anywhere in the Settings => Intentions | Compiler areas (not that I expected any such settings, I believe the IDEA should already know the correct classpath based on the pom file and JDK). As a final experiment I created a brand new standard J2SE application project (without using maven) and added the jmime.jar file directly to the project as one of its libraries.  I run into exactly the same problems as described above in this new project. Here is the MANIFEST.MF from the jmime jar file. I don't see anything unusual in this jar file. My best guess is that perhaps the problem might be a missing dependency issue.  But AFAIK jmime is supposed to be self contained (JarAnalyzer doesn't come up with anything, but I'm not sure it would if a dependency jar is missing). So, anyone have any IDEAs?First of all you should try File | Invalidate Caches and if it doesn't help, delete IDEA system directory. Then re-import the Maven project and see if it helps.

In some weird cases compiled classes may report wrong info and confuse IDEA. Verify that the classes from this jar report correct names using javap.The following trick resolved this issue for me: 


Right click on the code editor
Hover on Maven and expand
Click on Reimport


My idea version is 12.0.4None of the solutions above worked for me. What did was removing the main.iml file manually and it suddenly worked.This was mentioned in another answer to this same question here, but this alone fixes this for me.  I do all my builds in a separate terminal, outside of IntelliJ.  So the cache's need to have the proper permissions set for the IntelliJ app to read them.

Run it from the project's root folder.  

$ mvn -U idea:ideaFor Gradle users:

You may need to synchronize your project with your build.gradle file. 

You can right-click on your gradle file under the Project pane to do this, but that didn't seem to do anything for me (I suspect a bug in my version). You'll know if this happens because it wont' kick off any IntelliJ tasks that you will be waiting on. Instead, open up the Gradle Tool pane, then click the synchronize (refresh) button. This worked for me where invalidating the cache and restarting did not.

My own circumstance: I was using a Scala project with Gradle and had to do this.One extra step, when I did File -> Invalidate Caches and restarted the IDE, open a project. It popped up a toastbox on the top-right asking me whether to enable auto-import and that solved the problem.Inconsistent/duplicate module names in project structure was causing this issue for me.

Make sure the dependencies which are red actually exist in dependency list. If not, rename them to match existing dependency names


This can happen when IntelliJ doesn't shut down properly and thus cannot properly save renamed module names.Another thing to check: Be sure that dependencies are not duplicated. In my case I found that a module exhibiting this behavior was misconfigured as follows: it had a dependency on another module, and it had a dependency on a jar produced by that other module. This meant for every symbol referenced in duplicate, and was ambiguous.Press ""shift"" two times > ""Reimport All Maven projects"" always works for me.None of the other answeres worked for me. My imports were not being resolved because IntelliJ pointed to wrong .m2 file.

IntelliJ Version: IntelliJ Idea 2018.1.5

My location for the .m2 directory was pointed to the wrong path. All I did to fix it was re-point IntelliJ to the right .m2 directory and update it.

First, go to: File->Settings->Build, Execution, Deployment->Build Tools->Maven

I had to change the User settings file: and the Local repository: to the correct location of my .m2 directory.

After this go to: File->Settings->Build, Execution, Deployment->Build Tools->Maven->Repositories

and click the Update button.My Project Structure:

src -> main -> scala -> mypackages


What worked:

Right click on the scala folder, and click ""Mark Directory as Sources Root"".I'm jealous of all of you who resolved through File / Invalidate caches. I just spent hours trying everything on this question and a few others from around the web.
The magic menu item didn't do it for me so I invalidated the caches myself by nuking %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\JetBrains\IntelliJIdea2020.3\caches
Once I did this and restarted IntelliJ (2020.3), the indexes were rebuilt and my errors went away.If your maven project is a multi-module project, check if some of the modules are ignored by intellij.


Click on View -> Tool Windows -> Maven Projects, and check if some modules are ignored(Ignored modules are in grey, e.g. gs-multi-module in the following image).





Right click on the ignored module and choose Unignore Projects.




Then wait for intellij to finish indexing, after which it will work.I had problem with Maven Importer JDK - somehow it switched itself to JDK 11, but Maven Project reload worked only with JDK 8.For Gradle projects:


Exit IntelliJ IDEA
Delete the <problematic-project-root>/.idea directory
Delete the <problematic-project-root>/.gradle directory
Delete all .iml files in <problematic-project-root>


windows command prompt: DEL /S /Q *.iml
linux: find . | grep -e .iml$ | xargs rm

Re-import the project into IntelliJ IDEA with GradleYes, sounds like you have to create libraries containing the JARs you need and add them as a dependency in your module.For another alternative.

I got this problem also when I used JDK7_07. I tried all answers here (except deleting IDEA System Directory). But, I still got the problem. So what I did it is:

Install newest JDK (it was JDK7_45), and set the Intellij's JDK to the new one, and it works.Re-importing the project worked for me.
Right Click on Project -> Maven ->Reimport

when I did File -> Invalidate Caches and restarted the IDE,open a project. It showed a dialogue on the top-right ""Maven changes detected"" and gave an option to import and enable auto-import. Even after importing the project here, I had the same issue. The above step solved the problem.Suggested solutions did not work. I had to unignore several projects, by right clicking on the pom => maven => unignore project.

Then after a

mvn clean install -T 6 -DskipTests


in the console, IntelliJ was happy again. No idea how the projects became ignored...Sometimes, I just open project structure, and click project, then choose a SDK version.In my case, I am trying to open a spring boot project from IntellijIdea got the same issue like unable to import all spring related files.

Then I did:


  File -> Close Project -> Import Project -> Import from external model -> Choose Gradle -> Next -> Select the project from file location -> Finish


Now everything working fine as expected.

I have seen many answers here but I finally found this solution. It may use for someone like me.I just had this issue and it would just not go away. I eventually wiped out the IntelliJ config directory in ~ and rebuilt my IntelliJ project from scratch. (This only took about 15 minutes in the end, compared to spending an hour trying to work out problems with cached files, etc.)

Note that my guess is that the initial problem was caused by something like javathings.blogspot.com/2009/11/too-many-open-files-in-intellij-idea.html (NB: as of 2018, that link is dead, but archive.org has a copy of the page from around when this answer was first written -ed.) or a disk space/memory issue causing Java to crash. IntelliJ seemed to just get corrupted.After invalidating my cache and restarting; and confirming my maven settings were okay, I was still seeing ""Cannot resolve symbol"" for a module that I definitely had set as a dependency. Turns out I had it set to the wrong scope. 

You can check by right clicking on your module and selecting Open Module Settings. Click the dependency tab and verify that the scope for your un-resolvable dependency is set to Compile.Open ""Settings""
Search for ""Maven""
Click on ""Ignored Files"" under ""Maven""
Uncheck the pom.xml files contains the missing dependencies
Click ""OK""
Click File -> Invalidate Caches/Restart...
Click ""Invalidate and Restart""In my case, my project was using Lombok and I was missing the Lombok Plugin in IntelliJ. After installing it everything worked fine.In IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3, select:

File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart

When prompted with Download pre-built shared indexes:

don't import the shared indexes: close the dialog or choose More actions > Don't show againIn my case, only buildDir is removed.
In this case, File | Invalidate Caches does not work.

When I do Build | Make Project before File | Invalidate Caches, everything works fine.None of the above solutions solved it for me. I had the same issue where the code compiled fine but IntelliJ showed that it could not find the import. Even though IntelliJ suggested the import in the first place from code completion. 

My solution was to move everything to the default package, delete the com.foo.bar package, then create it again and move everything back.mvn idea:idea worked for me. Found it here. Spent more than an hour, hope it helps someoneHas a fixed been published? Appears issue originally affected v11/12 due to a ""Compiler overhaul"" back in 2013. With discussion on related issues in Jira up to end of 2014.
http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-98425

Also on Jira IDEA-98425 was marked fixed but unverified (on v12.0.3). None of the following work-around helped resolve this ""Unable to Resolve Symbol"" issue with Version 13.1.1 on Windows 

a. Delete .IdealIC13 folder (Then, File \ Invalidate Caches / Restart)

b. From Maven Projects window,      

b.1 mvn -U idea:idea –〉Executing this maven goal suppose to reload the dependencies. This works prev, but since last FRI, executing this maven goal failed as it tried to recompile the project (Of course it fails as ""Unable to resolve Symbols"", that's what I am trying to fix by running this command in the first place)          mvn -version — shows maven version referenced 3.2.5 and that it's working    

b.2 Simply right click project, and Reimport    

b.3 File \ Invalidate Caches / Restart

c. Tried both Enable  & Disable this setting: File -> Settings -> Maven -> Importing -> ""Use maven3 to import project""

d. Settings \ Maven \ Multiproject build fail policy = Fail at end (instead of Default) 

Nothing works. What's happenning to IntelliJ support on Maven.

Is Software Development Process the same as Software Development Life Cycle? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 3 years ago. I have been taking classes on Udacity for the course ""Software Development Process"". In Lesson 1, A software process was defined as the process of breaking down software development into smaller pieces that can be tackled individually.
In lesson 2 however, the software development life cycle was introduced as a sequence of decisions that determine the history of the software. However, when I googled for software development life cycle, it was defined as ""The process of planning, creating, testing and deploying an information system"" and when I googled for the various software development processes and software development life cycle models, they were both almost the same. This has got me a bit confused. Could you please tell me the difference between the two?They are similar but I'd say that in the real world, the ""process"" part is about the beginning of the life cycle.  Namely requirements, prototyping, design, construction etc.  In practice, when people talk about the life cycle they're also considering upgrades, maintenance, feature timelines, and eventually replacement.  

""Process"" has many flavors-du-jour like agile, scrum, waterfall, spiral, etc.  Life cycle places less emphasis on process and and more on path from inception to replacement/retirement of the product. 

Process is tactical, life cycle (at its best) is strategic.They are almost the same thing.  The difference is really just one of emphasis.

The ""life-cycle"" is looking at software development from a descriptive perspective; i.e. ""this is how software is developed"".

The ""process"" is looking it from a more prescriptive perspective; i.e. ""this is what people should do / how they should do it when developing software"".

And to be honest, people often use the terms / viewpoints interchangeably.I have been taking classes on Udacity for the course ""Software Development Process"".

For example for my blog the filter label is ""Pages"" but our visitors don't call them ""Pages"" and they have no idea what ""Pages"" are. 



	Thanks!There is no way in which to customise which are shown or what labels they have. They will have the label of the application in which is being used.

Is there a software-engineering methodology for functional programming? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 5 years ago. Software Engineering as it is taught today is entirely focused on object-oriented programming and the 'natural' object-oriented view of the world. There is a detailed methodology that describes how to transform a domain model into a class model with several steps and a lot of (UML) artifacts like use-case-diagrams or class-diagrams. Many programmers have internalized this approach and have a good idea about how to design an object-oriented application from scratch. The new hype is functional programming, which is taught in many books and tutorials. But what about functional software engineering? 
While reading about Lisp and Clojure, I came about two interesting statements: Functional programs are often developed bottom up instead of top down ('On Lisp', Paul Graham) Functional Programmers use Maps where OO-Programmers use objects/classes ('Clojure for Java Programmers', talk by Rich Hickley). So what is the methodology for a systematic (model-based ?) design of a functional application, i.e. in Lisp or Clojure? What are the common steps, what artifacts do I use, how do I map them from the problem space to the solution space?Thank God that the software-engineering people have not yet discovered functional programming.  Here are some parallels:


Many OO ""design patterns"" are captured as higher-order functions.  For example, the Visitor pattern is known in the functional world as a ""fold"" (or if you are a pointy-headed theorist, a ""catamorphism"").  In functional languages, data types are mostly trees or tuples, and every tree type has a natural catamorphism associated with it.  

These higher-order functions often come with certain laws of programming, aka ""free theorems"".
Functional programmers use diagrams much less heavily than OO programmers.  Much of what is expressed in OO diagrams is instead expressed in types, or in ""signatures"", which you should think of as ""module types"".  Haskell also has ""type classes"", which is a bit like an interface type.

Those functional programmers who use types generally think that ""once you get the types right; the code practically writes itself.""

Not all functional languages use explicit types, but the How To Design Programs book, an excellent book for learning Scheme/Lisp/Clojure, relies heavily on ""data descriptions"", which are closely related to types.



  So what is the methodology for a systematic (model-based ?) design of a functional application, i.e. in Lisp or Clojure? 


Any design method based on data abstraction works well.  I happen to think that this is easier when the language has explicit types, but it works even without.  A good book about design methods for abstract data types, which is easily adapted to functional programming, is Abstraction and Specification in Program Development by Barbara Liskov and John Guttag, the first edition.  Liskov won the Turing award in part for that work.

Another design methodology that is unique to Lisp is to decide what language extensions would be useful in the problem domain in which you are working, and then use hygienic macros to add these constructs to your language.  A good place to read about this kind of design is Matthew Flatt's article Creating Languages in Racket.  The article may be behind a paywall. You can also find more general material on this kind of design by searching for the term ""domain-specific embedded language""; for particular advice and examples beyond what Matthew Flatt covers, I would probably start with Graham's On Lisp or perhaps ANSI Common Lisp.


  What are the common steps, what artifacts do I use?


Common steps:


Identify the data in your program and the operations on it, and define an abstract data type representing this data.
Identify common actions or patterns of computation, and express them as higher-order functions or macros.  Expect to take this step as part of refactoring.
If you're using a typed functional language, use the type checker early and often.  If you're using Lisp or Clojure, the best practice is to write function contracts first including unit tests—it's test-driven development to the max.  And you will want to use whatever version of QuickCheck has been ported to your platform, which in your case looks like it's called ClojureCheck. It's an extremely powerful library for constructing random tests of code that uses higher-order functions.For Clojure, I recommend going back to good old relational modeling. Out of the Tarpit is an inspirational read.Personally I find that all the usual good practices from OO development apply in functional programming as well - just with a few minor tweaks to take account of the functional worldview. From a methodology perspective, you don't really need to do anything fundamentally different.

My experience comes from having moved from Java to Clojure in recent years.

Some examples:


Understand your business domain / data model - equally important whether you are going to design an object model or create a functional data structure with nested maps. In some ways, FP can be easier because it encourages you to think about data model separately from functions / processes but you still have to do both. 
Service orientation in design - actually works very well from a FP perspective, since a typical service is really just a function with some side effects. I think that the ""bottom up"" view of software development sometimes espoused in the Lisp world is actually just good service-oriented API design principles in another guise.
Test Driven Development - works well in FP languages, in fact sometimes even better because pure functions lend themselves extremely well to writing clear, repeatable tests without any need for setting up a stateful environment. You might also want to build separate tests to check data integrity (e.g. does this map have all the keys in it that I expect, to balance the fact that in an OO language the class definition would enforce this for you at compile time).
Prototying / iteration - works just as well with FP. You might even be able to prototype live with users if you get very extremely good at building tools / DSL and using them at the REPL.OO programming tightly couples data with behavior. Functional programming separates the two. So you don't have class diagrams, but you do have data structures, and you particularly have algebraic data types. Those types can be written to very tightly match your domain, including eliminating impossible values by construction.

So there aren't books and books on it, but there is a well established approach to, as the saying goes, make impossible values unrepresentable.

In so doing, you can make a range of choices about representing certain types of data as functions instead, and conversely, representing certain functions as a union of data types instead so that you can get, e.g., serialization, tighter specification, optimization, etc.

Then, given that, you write functions over your adts such that you establish some sort of algebra -- i.e. there are fixed laws which hold for these functions. Some are maybe idempotent -- the same after multiple applications. Some are associative. Some are transitive, etc.

Now you have a domain over which you have functions which compose according to well behaved laws. A simple embedded DSL!

Oh, and given properties, you can of course write automated randomized tests of them (ala QuickCheck).. and that's just the beginning.Object Oriented design isn't the same thing as software engineering. Software engineering has to do with the entire process of how we go from requirements to a working system, on time and with a low defect rate. Functional programming may be different from OO, but it does not do away with requirements, high level and detailed designs, verification and testing, software metrics, estimation, and all that other ""software engineering stuff"".

Furthermore, functional programs do exhibit modularity and other structure. Your detailed designs have to be expressed in terms of the concepts in that structure.One approach is to create an internal DSL within the functional programming language of choice. The ""model"" then is a set of business rules expressed in the DSL.See my answer to another post:

How does Clojure aproach Separation of Concerns?

I agree more needs to be written on the subject on how to structure large applications that use an FP approach (Plus more needs to be done to document FP-driven UIs)While this might be considered naive and simplistic, I think ""design recipes"" (a systematic approach to problem solving applied to programming as advocated by Felleisen et al. in their book HtDP) would be close to what you seem to be looking for.

Here, a few links:

http://www.northeastern.edu/magazine/0301/programming.html

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.86.8371I've recently found this book:
Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling

I think is perfectly in line with your question.

From the book description:


  Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling teaches you how to think of the domain model in terms of pure functions and how to compose them to build larger abstractions. You will start with the basics of functional programming and gradually progress to the advanced concepts and patterns that you need to know to implement complex domain models. The book demonstrates how advanced FP patterns like algebraic data types, typeclass based design, and isolation of side-effects can make your model compose for readability and verifiability.There is the ""program calculation"" / ""design by calculation"" style associated with Prof. Richard Bird and the Algebra of Programming group at Oxford University (UK), I don't think its too far-fetched to consider this a methodology.

Personally while I like the work produced by the AoP group, I don't have the discipline to practice design in this way myself. However that's my shortcoming, and not one of program calculation.I've found Behavior Driven Development to be a natural fit for rapidly developing code in both Clojure and SBCL. The real upside of leveraging BDD with a functional language is that I tend to write much finer grain unit tests than I usually do when using procedural languages because I do a much better job of decomposing the problem into smaller chunks of functionality.Honestly if you want design recipes for functional programs, take a look at the standard function libraries such as Haskell's Prelude.  In FP, patterns are usually captured by higher order procedures (functions that operate on functions) themselves.  So if a pattern is seen, often a higher order function is simply created to capture that pattern.

A good example is fmap.  This function takes a function as an argument and applies it to all the ""elements"" of the second argument.  Since it is part of the Functor type class, any instance of a Functor (such as a list, graph, etc...) may be passed as a second argument to this function.  It captures the general behavior of applying a function to every element of its second argument.Well,

Generally many Functional Programming Languages are used at universities for a long time for ""small toy problems"".

They are getting more popular now since OOP has difficulties with ""paralel programming"" because of ""state"".And sometime functional style is better for problem at hand like Google MapReduce.

I am sure that, when functioanl guys hit the wall [ try to implement systems bigger than 1.000.000 lines of code], some of them will come with new software-engineering methodologies with buzz words :-). They should answer the old question: How to divide system into pieces so that we can ""bite"" each pieces one at a time? [ work iterative, inceremental en evolutionary way] using Functional Style.


  It is sure that Functional Style will effect our Object Oriented
  Style.We ""still"" many concepts from Functional Systems and adapted to
  our OOP languages.


But will functional programs will be used for such a big systems?Will they become main stream? That is the question.

And Nobody can come with realistic methodology without implementing such a big systems, making his-her hands dirty.

Issue when moving to PHP 8.0,"Hi guys



	I'm trying to future proof our site however when switching from PHP 7.4 to 8.0 the Activity Feed sidebar goes missing and we get the following error. When refreshing the site for the first time the screen is blank until you refresh a second time.

	I've tried disabling all plugins, cleared the cache and no errors show up under Support. We do use 2 custom theme's but both are up to date and the same thing happens on the standard skin.



	Any help would be appreciated.You have an outdated theme. Try to switch to the default unmodified theme and it will work.Same thing happens on the standard Theme. I use the popular Carbon and Uniform themes which are both up to date.



	I just saw this post




	I wonder if this is the issue.Unfortunately the memory limit wasn't the issue as it was already set to 256.



	I've tried disabling everything via the customizations overview site seems to work. I'm having a real hard time trying determine which plugin or app is the cause.If you go to the support page of your admin CP, you will see ""view hooks"" on the right of the page.

Issue with alerts and dismiss button in mobile devices,"Good day,



	There is an Issue with alerts and dismiss button in mobile devices.



	The dismiss button added using the new alerts functionality is not displayed on mobile devices, so the user trying to see the forums won't be able to do so since he cannot dismiss the alert as it's not seen on mobile devices. It just doesn't fit 



	I tried it and the only way to see the dismiss button on mobile devices is.



	1. By switching to chrome's desktop mode, dismissing the alert and then switching back to the mobile version of the sire.



	2. Or by using the mobile in horizontal mode. In vertical mode, the dismiss mode won't be seen.



	Three users have contacted me today asking me to remove the alert. They did not think about these two options, so there is something wrong.



	Can this issue be fixed? The majority of mobile users browse the community using the mobile in vertical position, not in landscape position.



	Thanks

Issue with next unread topic link,"Hello,



	I believe there is an Issue with next unread topic link. 



	I've seen this happen quite a few times, so I am reporting it. It just happened now again.



	I was reading a few new posts and then I saw the NEXT UNREAD TOPIC was no longer visible. So, I thought that I was done reading new ones. But no, there were new unread topics that were posts since I started to read the new topics when I clicked on the unread messages stream.



	It seems that the system will not detect the newest topics, the new ones submitted before the date of the last topic being read.



	This issue has happened quite a few times. Happened just now again..I can see more than 10 new unread topics and the last unread topic I was reading didn't have the NEXT UNREAD MESSAGE link visible.



	-----



	Sometimes it also happens that the next unread topic link is no longer visible when the new topics belong to another user. That is, I start reviewing new topics from user X, let's say 10..the last topic from user X is reached and the next unread message link will no longer be shown. There will be new messages, but they belong to other users.

	Hello Marc, We still having this issue. Could you please help in this.


	Whenever we switch the theme it works fine for some time and after it again reload without the screen.Hello there, you can try one more thing if you wish.

	Go to themes and activate the designer mode.

	After that just follow the steps from the image I left down below.



	1.




	2. Wait until the designer mode was builded on all of your templates.

	3. 



	4. After that, when you are done,  press on this button again and follow the last steps from the image that I left you down below.




	 



	Now, maybe this isn't the right way to do it, but when ever I had a problem like that, I just did this what I showed you in the images and everything worked again (90.99% sure) 😄 😛

JMeter software under test,"I am doing a seminar on JMeter and I need to demo on some software. My professor say we need an open source software. So that we can set it up on local host and testing against it The problem is I don't know which open source software should be used. I am new to JMeter and saw some examples with testing a website only So can anyone tell me some open source software that can be put under test with JMeter? Thanks in advance.Yes, start with this GitHub project and then, since the project includes Groovy, and requires Maven to run, then you have 2 additional open source projects involved.   All you have to do is run JMeter using the included .bat script and then create a TestPlan with a JSR223-Groovy sampler in it.  (The project I mention above will launch a certain version of Jmeter 2.11)

You could also go one step further and install PostgresSQL (also open source) and then create a JDBC sampler that connects to it using Jmeter  (because the Jmeter project I mentioned above also includes the postgres jdbc driver by default).

If you need a REST api to test against, then install Jenkins on your local computer and you can get Jmeter to perform rest queries against it.",,,,,1,216,53.89,51.1,42.86,56.34,27,21.3,87.04,69.44,52.31,12.5,7.41,3.7,0.93,2.78,0,0,5.09,11.57,6.48,1.85,12.5,8.33,2.78,10.19,0.46,21.76,5.56,3.7,1.85,0.93,0.93,0,14.35,0.93,13.43,0.93,4.63,4.17,0.93,0,2.78,0,2.31,2.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.41,2.31,0.46,0.46,0,0,2.31,5.09,0,0,0,0.46,2.78,0,0,2.78,6.02,0,0,6.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.78,0,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0.93,6.48,10.19,0,2.78,7.41,0.46,0,0,3.7,1.39,5.56,1.39,0.46,0,0.46,0,0,11.11,4.63,2.31,0.46,0,0.46,3.24,

Load Testing Software [closed],"I am working on a proposal for my company into purchasing some load testing software. I have to give 2 choices. One of my choices I am proposing is HP(Mecurary) Loadrunner. Is there another program out there that is comparible with Loadrunner? We are looking at using the software to test the performance of the following. C# .NET Template Microsoft® .NET 2.0, 3.0 Microsoft® SQL Server Informix Web (HTTP/HTML) Web Services Web and Multimedia Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Domain Name System (DNS) Microsoft® Exchange (MAPI)OpenSourceTesting.com has a list of OSS performance tools.

The Software Testing FAQ also has a list of commercial and OSS performance testing tools.

Since it looks like you're on a Windows platform, you can also use the following tools:


Visual Studio Application Center Test (Enterprise Editions only?)
Microsoft Web Application Stress tool (aka WAS, aka ""Homer""; predecessor to Application Center Test)


There are a lot of options out there, but it seems like you have a good handle on your requirements. I recommend doing a trade study of your top choices, using weighted criteria and a rank of how each product scores (sort of like a custom ""Consumer Reports"" style comparison). This will help you reduce any preconceived notions towards or against a product, and also gives your management a sound empirical reason as to why you choose the tool you did. This can go a long way in justifying the cost for a big ticket item.

Also, for the commercial tools, the vendors will often come on site and set up a demo system to test your code. We did this a few years back with Mercury, Rational and NuMega.

The product is comprehensive and you can script it in a variety of languages including C#. I'd try the 30-day trial and how it compares to LoadRunner for your specific requirements.I've used openSTA.

This allows a session with a web site to be recorded and then played back via a relatively simple script language.

You can easily test web services and write your own scripts.

It allows you to put scripts together in a test in any way you want and configure the number of iterations, the number of users in each iteration, the ramp up time to introduce each new user and the delay between each iteration. Tests can also be scheduled in the future.

It's open source and free.

It produces a number of reports which can be saved to a spreadsheet. We then use a pivot table to easily analyse and graph the results.I have used WebLOAD in previous projects - it's comparable to LoadRunner, but more cost-effective.It you must have all of the interfaces noted, then you are only going to be looking at commercial tools.   The closest comparable in the commercial space is Microfocus' SilkPerformer product, but the breadth of your interfaces may push you back into the Loadrunner space, as it does have the greatest number of out of the box protocols supported of any tool out there.

"Locales selector on Windows Server (yes, I know)","Hi,



	Disclaimer: I am fully aware that your Windows Server support is very limited. I do not have any problem with languages. I'm reporting just in case:



	I assume that the selector should show only locales which are already installed. But on Windows Server the selector seems to work the way around showing only not installed locales. On my Windows Server 2019 which supports out of box most locales the menu includes only very exotic languages. For example, no English (United States) available to be selected while my OS is a native en-US.



	So for all locales already supported by my server I need to select ""My locale is not listed"" and input a correct short code. Following the Windows tip from the PHP setlocale description that would be this format (eg. ""usa"" instead of ""en_US"" but it can't be ""enu"" because then a flag is not detected in the Languages menu at the bottom).



	As I said, currently I don't have any problem with languages. But is this a bug in the selector?



			
				


	Edited August 19 by LuuukI think what may have been missed here is the support part.Its not limited support we can offer when there are issues on windows server. With windows server, we dont offer support at all. So this wouldnt be a bug, as much as being simply its run on an unsupported platform.Thanks for the answer. I was pretty sure that would be the result.



	BTW. Are we going for ""semanticts""?

	This is how this solution would likely be resolved with an image. Roughly speaking, high-DPI displays have twice as many pixels per inch than their traditional counterparts. For images to look good on those screens, they need to be twice as large.

Looping through the content of a file in Bash,"How do I iterate through each line of a text file with Bash? With this script: I get this output on the screen: (Later I want to do something more complicated with $p than just output to the screen.) The environment variable SHELL is (from env): /bin/bash --version output: cat /proc/version output: The file peptides.txt contains:One way to do it is:

while read p; do
  echo ""$p""
done <peptides.txt


As pointed out in the comments, this has the side effects of trimming leading whitespace, interpreting backslash sequences, and skipping the last line if it's missing a terminating linefeed. If these are concerns, you can do:

while IFS="""" read -r p || [ -n ""$p"" ]
do
  printf '%s\n' ""$p""
done < peptides.txt




Exceptionally, if the loop body may read from standard input, you can open the file using a different file descriptor:

while read -u 10 p; do
  ...
done 10<peptides.txt


Here, 10 is just an arbitrary number (different from 0, 1, 2).cat peptides.txt | while read line 
do
   # do something with $line here
done


and the one-liner variant:

cat peptides.txt | while read line; do something_with_$line_here; done


These options will skip the last line of the file if there is no trailing line feed.

You can avoid this by the following:

cat peptides.txt | while read line || [[ -n $line ]];
do
   # do something with $line here
doneOption 1a: While loop:  Single line at a time:  Input redirection
#!/bin/bash
filename='peptides.txt'
echo Start
while read p; do 
    echo ""$p""
done < ""$filename""

Option 1b: While loop:  Single line at a time:

Open the file, read from a file descriptor (in this case file descriptor #4).
#!/bin/bash
filename='peptides.txt'
exec 4<""$filename""
echo Start
while read -u4 p ; do
    echo ""$p""
doneThis is no better than other answers, but is one more way to get the job done in a file without spaces (see comments). I find that I often need one-liners to dig through lists in text files without the extra step of using separate script files.

for word in $(cat peptides.txt); do echo $word; done


This format allows me to put it all in one command-line. Change the ""echo $word"" portion to whatever you want and you can issue multiple commands separated by semicolons. The following example uses the file's contents as arguments into two other scripts you may have written.

for word in $(cat peptides.txt); do cmd_a.sh $word; cmd_b.py $word; done


Or if you intend to use this like a stream editor (learn sed) you can dump the output to another file as follows.

for word in $(cat peptides.txt); do cmd_a.sh $word; cmd_b.py $word; done > outfile.txt


I've used these as written above because I have used text files where I've created them with one word per line. (See comments) If you have spaces that you don't want splitting your words/lines, it gets a little uglier, but the same command still works as follows:

OLDIFS=$IFS; IFS=$'\n'; for line in $(cat peptides.txt); do cmd_a.sh $line; cmd_b.py $line; done > outfile.txt; IFS=$OLDIFS


This just tells the shell to split on newlines only, not spaces, then returns the environment back to what it was previously. At this point, you may want to consider putting it all into a shell script rather than squeezing it all into a single line, though.

Best of luck!A few more things not covered by other answers:

Reading from a delimited file

# ':' is the delimiter here, and there are three fields on each line in the file
# IFS set below is restricted to the context of `read`, it doesn't affect any other code
while IFS=: read -r field1 field2 field3; do
  # process the fields
  # if the line has less than three fields, the missing fields will be set to an empty string
  # if the line has more than three fields, `field3` will get all the values, including the third field plus the delimiter(s)
done < input.txt


Reading from the output of another command, using process substitution

while read -r line; do
  # process the line
done < <(command ...)


This approach is better than command ... | while read -r line; do ... because the while loop here runs in the current shell rather than a subshell as in the case of the latter. See the related post A variable modified inside a while loop is not remembered.

Reading from a null delimited input, for example find ... -print0

while read -r -d '' line; do
  # logic
  # use a second 'read ... <<< ""$line""' if we need to tokenize the line
done < <(find /path/to/dir -print0)


Related read: BashFAQ/020 - How can I find and safely handle file names containing newlines, spaces or both?

Reading from more than one file at a time

while read -u 3 -r line1 && read -u 4 -r line2; do
  # process the lines
  # note that the loop will end when we reach EOF on either of the files, because of the `&&`
done 3< input1.txt 4< input2.txt


Based on @chepner's answer here:

-u is a bash extension. For POSIX compatibility, each call would look something like read -r X <&3.

Reading a whole file into an array (Bash versions earlier to 4)

while read -r line; do
    my_array+=(""$line"")
done < my_file


If the file ends with an incomplete line (newline missing at the end), then:

while read -r line || [[ $line ]]; do
    my_array+=(""$line"")
done < my_file


Reading a whole file into an array (Bash versions 4x and later)

readarray -t my_array < my_file


or

mapfile -t my_array < my_file


And then

for line in ""${my_array[@]}""; do
  # process the lines
done

What is the difference between thee approaches to reading a file that has just one line?
Bash while read loop extremely slow compared to cat, why?Use a while loop, like this:

while IFS= read -r line; do
   echo ""$line""
done <file


Notes: 


If you don't set the IFS properly, you will lose indentation.
You should almost always use the -r option with read.
Don't read lines with forSuppose you have this file:

$ cat /tmp/test.txt
Line 1
    Line 2 has leading space
Line 3 followed by blank line

Line 5 (follows a blank line) and has trailing space    
Line 6 has no ending CR


There are four elements that will alter the meaning of the file output read by many Bash solutions: 


The blank line 4;
Leading or trailing spaces on two lines;
Maintaining the meaning of individual lines (i.e., each line is a record);
The line 6 not terminated with a CR.


If you want the text file line by line including blank lines and terminating lines without CR, you must use a while loop and you must have an alternate test for the final line.  

Here are the methods that may change the file (in comparison to what cat returns):

1) Lose the last line and leading and trailing spaces:

$ while read -r p; do printf ""%s\n"" ""'$p'""; done </tmp/test.txt
'Line 1'
'Line 2 has leading space'
'Line 3 followed by blank line'
''
'Line 5 (follows a blank line) and has trailing space'


(If you do while IFS= read -r p; do printf ""%s\n"" ""'$p'""; done </tmp/test.txt instead, you preserve the leading and trailing spaces but still lose the last line if it is not terminated with CR)

2) Using process substitution with cat will reads the entire file in one gulp and loses the meaning of individual lines:

$ for p in ""$(cat /tmp/test.txt)""; do printf ""%s\n"" ""'$p'""; done
'Line 1
    Line 2 has leading space
Line 3 followed by blank line

Line 5 (follows a blank line) and has trailing space    
Line 6 has no ending CR'


(If you remove the "" from $(cat /tmp/test.txt) you read the file word by word rather than one gulp. Also probably not what is intended...)



The most robust and simplest way to read a file line-by-line and preserve all spacing is:

$ while IFS= read -r line || [[ -n $line ]]; do printf ""'%s'\n"" ""$line""; done </tmp/test.txt
'Line 1'
'    Line 2 has leading space'
'Line 3 followed by blank line'
''
'Line 5 (follows a blank line) and has trailing space    '
'Line 6 has no ending CR'


If you want to strip leading and trading spaces, remove the IFS= part:

$ while read -r line || [[ -n $line ]]; do printf ""'%s'\n"" ""$line""; done </tmp/test.txt
'Line 1'
'Line 2 has leading space'
'Line 3 followed by blank line'
''
'Line 5 (follows a blank line) and has trailing space'
'Line 6 has no ending CR'


(A text file without a terminating \n, while fairly common, is considered broken under POSIX. If you can count on the trailing \n you do not need || [[ -n $line ]] in the while loop.) 

More at the BASH FAQIf you don't want your read to be broken by newline character, use -

#!/bin/bash
while IFS='' read -r line || [[ -n ""$line"" ]]; do
    echo ""$line""
done < ""$1""


Then run the script with file name as parameter.This might be the simplest answer and maybe it don't work in all cases, but it is working great for me:
while read line;do echo ""$line"";done<peptides.txt

if you need to enclose in parenthesis for spaces:
while read line;do echo \""$line\"";done<peptides.txt

Ahhh this is pretty much the same as the answer that got upvoted most, but its all on one line.I like to use xargs instead of while. xargs is powerful and command line friendly

cat peptides.txt | xargs -I % sh -c ""echo %""

With xargs, you can also add verbosity with -t and validation with -p#!/bin/bash
#
# Change the file name from ""test"" to desired input file 
# (The comments in bash are prefixed with #'s)
for x in $(cat test.txt)
do
    echo $x

Declare variable outside of the loop, set value and use it outside of loop requires done <<< ""$(...)"" syntax. Application need to be run within a context of current console. Quotes around the command keeps newlines of output stream.

Loop match for substrings then reads name=value pair, splits right-side part of last = character, drops first quote, drops last quote, we have a clean value to be used elsewhere.This is coming rather very late, but with the thought that it may help someone, i am adding the answer. Also this may not be the best way. head command can be used with -n argument to read n lines from start of file and likewise tail command can be used to read from bottom. Now, to fetch nth line from file, we head n lines, pipe the data to tail only 1 line from the piped data.  

   TOTAL_LINES=`wc -l $USER_FILE | cut -d "" "" -f1 `
   echo $TOTAL_LINES       # To validate total lines in the file

   for (( i=1 ; i <= $TOTAL_LINES; i++ ))
   do
      LINE=`head -n$i $USER_FILE | tail -n1`
      echo $LINE
   done@Peter: This could work out for you-

echo ""Start!"";for p in $(cat ./pep); do
echo $p
done


This would return the output-

Start!

<file_name | xargs -I {} echo {}

echo can be replaced with other commands or piped further.Per Ed Morton, Why is using a shell loop to process text considered bad practice?

The answer is: don't process text with bash, process text in bash with the tool designed for this task, awk.
https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html
#! /usr/bin/env awk -f

BEGIN { print(""do anything you want here!""); }
{
   print(""processing line: "", $0);
}
END { print(""and anything else here!"") };

And invoke with:
./awk-script.awk peptides.txt


And in a bash script:
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo ""foo"" | awk ""{print}""",,,,,1,2177,74.88,25.91,77.48,12.13,41.87,14.47,78.5,55.26,41.85,6.29,3.4,1.47,0.18,1.7,0,0.05,2.89,11.62,6.52,4.27,10.2,8.27,2.76,6.16,0.96,15.25,4.55,3.45,2.25,0.32,1.19,1.19,11.53,0.73,10.7,1.61,1.79,1.52,2.85,0.18,4.36,0.05,1.65,0.41,1.19,0.83,0.05,0.73,0,0.09,0.55,0,6.57,4.13,0.09,0,0.09,0,3.4,2.3,0.05,0,0,0,0.14,0,0,0.14,2.99,0,0,2.99,0.05,0,0.41,0.09,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0.32,0.41,0.28,0.64,0.05,0,0,0.28,0.09,3.45,14.47,0.18,0.78,11.62,0.83,1.15,0.05,3.95,2.53,4,0.69,3.12,3.12,0,0.05,0,48.14,5.47,2.76,0.28,0.51,3.9,35.23,

Maintaining software versions [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 12 years ago. I am preparing an Excel sheet in which I have to maintain the version number of different pieces of software developed at our company. Can anyone tell me what kind of information to save along with the version number in that sheet for different types of software? I know only one attribute that is version number, and if anything else so please let me know. RegardsItems to consider recording:


Software version number
Release date
Build date perhaps 
Build platform - O/S version, compiler, libraries
Supported platforms - where the software is considered likely to work
Version control system (VCS) tags or labels
Manual version information - if not automatically in the software distribution


The supported platforms are of relevance if you build on Windows XP but expect it to work on Vista and Windows 7, for example; or perhaps you build on Linux kernel 2.6.9 and expect it to work with more recent versions; or perhaps you build on Solaris 9 and expect it to work on Solaris 10 too.



A few more things that might be useful (depending a lot on the context):


Locations of (design and implementation) documentation for features added to the release
Information about the bugs fixed in the release
Possibly names of people involved in the development - especially names that would not show up in the VCS
Information about undocumented features in the product
Information about features planned for the product that didn't make it in
Information about security certifications obtained for the software (Common Criteria, FIPS 140-2, etc)

Marketing Software Online [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 10 years ago. What are some resources in use for marketing downloadable desktop software online? AdWords, certainly, and ""organic"" search engine results but is anyone having any luck making sales through sites like Tucows and/or Download.com anymorE?Joel on Software forumsThere are many ways to market your software online.  Some cost money, many do not.  Consider the following:


Start a blog and update it regularly with items of interest to your potential customers
Create forums where users can report bugs, ask for help, and suggest features.  Build a community around your product that potential customers can find.  Many will judge you by what those in your community say about your products.
Submit press releases when you have announcements.  There are many free, and some paid, sites that accept press releases.  Don't forget announcements forums, newsgroups, and mailing lists.

Start by making the requirements very clear and then considering the objects and responsibilities that emerge from satisfying the requirements. As you improve your object design you start to find a need to control dependencies and increase flexibility, and at that point you being to see design patterns.

For example: suppose you receive several different data formats and need to transform them in the mediation.

with hgwebdir.fcgi, you can use fastcgi and apache or nginx. 


This can be useful for publishing multiple repos using web server.Kiln is an alternative. Unlike RhodeCode it is commercial (i.e. not free) and you have to setup / import any existing mercurial repositories, which can be a bit of work.

Mips calculation for embedded software,"I have been recently (and repeatedly) asked by customers about MIPS needed to run our software. Usually we was able to get rid of this questions by explaining the customer that this is really depend on the cpu/os/hw (our software is highly portable) and/or use case (i.e. how our software is used). But I have a last one not only very stubborn but in addition provides good reasons to be  stubborn. :) He wants an estimate because he is not sure he has enough power to run our software, so buying the software before this estimate is not logical. (We can't provide the demo/evaluation since it will require significant amount of work to run on this specific platform.) And now the the question: Does somebody have an experience with such task on any piece of hw with any software? Any real life example will be really helpful. I have an option to run our software on many OS and many hardware. So if you know any tool for such estimate on any hardware there is a chance I can use it or at least get an idea. For know I only know how to measure CPU load on eCosPro OS. Edit: Using probe is actually a good idea, assuming that i can create a control environment where only my software is running all instruction i can count is mine, and i guess probe has an interface to do it. Actually i have a few different hardware debuggers and if somebody have experience how to do it will be really good, any way I'm going to read some documentation tomorrow and hopefully will find something in this direction.OK you realize that this is fraught with disclaimers & warnings -- CPU speeds, memory speeds, cache hits, MMU page tables flushes, bus contention, etc... (if it's a heavy-duty embedded system) all factor significantly into the decision....

Having said that.... what I would do is this.  Get a real-time operating system (stay with me), perhaps something like FreeRTOS (free, what a surprise) or u/C-OS-II (not free for commercial use, maybe $3K).  These kernels allow you to instrument the code to count idle CPU cycles (idle task spin loop).  

So run your whole application (or the customer's application) as the only (non-idle) task on a board that you guys agree on (e.g. MPC860 board, ARM7 board, etc...).  Measure the % CPU on the board via the RTOS.  (e.g. ""on the Flibber board running at 60 MHz, our application used 12% of the CPU."")

Without them giving you more, or vice versa, that sounds like a pretty reasonable length to go to for them.

The good thing is that once you've done this, you can re-use the work for other targets and/or boards, maybe the figures will help you increase sales and/or tune/optimize your software.

Good luck!Do you have a simulator or debugger probe which can give you a instruction count? You don't even need to do it for the right target platform, just a rough instruction count will do.

If everything else fails, run it on whatever platform you have access to, scale the runtime with the quotient of your-MHz/customer's-MHz. This should give you a very rough estimate of what kind of runtimes the customer will experience.I/S is a ""weak"" metric for a system with an operating system.

In the nitty-gritty, what you have to do is 


figure out the worst-case instruction path and count how many cycles it takes to execute(this means reading the assembly for that CPU and reviewing the CPU handbook that tell you # of cycles). 
Now figure out your real-time constraints.
Then you use #1 for worst-case cycles. Adjust the CPU upward/downward until it fits in the real-time constraints.
Add a fudge factor.The first thing that you're going to need to do is to come up with some sort of criteria for correct operation.
This is going to depend very much on the nature of the application - your criteria might include ""must execute code x in 3ms"", or ""must have a latency lower than 100ms"".
Any criterion that doesn't relate back to a quantitative measurement is going to be difficult as it will be subjective.

Finding your criteria for correct operation will allow you to find the critical portions of code. Bear in mind that these may be found in corner cases rather than normal operation.

If those critical portions of code are small then counting instructions for your target platform is going to be relatively straightfoward. If you've got a simulator that may be even easier. (depending on the code you may need to do a mock up to ensure that it gets executed, but that will likely still be easier than counting instructions if you've got a big chunk of code to analyse)

If your critical code is large then you might have to do something similar to JesperE's suggestion. Unless your application is targeted at an incredibly price sensitive industry the chances are that the customer will be willing to accept a little slack in the calculations - so better to over estimate than under estimate your cpu requirements.

Where I would differ from JesperE's suggestion is to suggest not concentrating on MHz but rather the actual MIPS of the targets. For example, compile and execute your code on a test platform - if you've got a profiler that may be all the better. Then compile your code for the customer's target and do a rough comparison of the number of instructions in the resultant executable.
You can then incorporate this ratio, along with the relative MIPS of the test and target processors, into the calculation of execution time.You say that your software is highly portable, so my suggestion would be to run the software on the platform that is closest in processor architecture, processor instruction set and memory / peripheral bus type. Measure the longest routine that has to run in realtime and then make an estimate as to how long it will run on their architecture.On two of the processor architectures that I use (MSP430F5X and AVR32) there is a hardware cycle count register built into the processor.  I normally have a scheme where, when the processor is not busy it is placed into a low power idle state with the processor core halted.  There are then two options for working out the actual processor load.  I can either set a breakpoint in a periodic timer function and read the number of processor cycles executed or I can instrument particular processes by reading this register at the start and end of their operation.  The processor idle time does not appear in the cycle count as the CPU is halted for this time.

You do not specify your processor architecture but this capability may be present.RapiTime claims to can give a probabilistic estimate of worst-case execution time for your target.  I've not used it personally, but have seen their presentations...

If your target is similar enough to your customer's you can probably scale it to estimate the WCET on their platform.  They can then compare that with the ""spare"" time their current system has.Most modern day debuggers give you the capability to view the instructions consumed eg; RVDS. Plus, you can use processor emulators to get a decent idea of instructions consumed without actually running on the platform (if your code is standalone such as a codec or a cryptographic module and doesnt depend on board) - note that this will give you instructions, not cycles. The cycles will be affected by your board details (eg; wait states, memory access etc)",,,,,1,1278,60.68,57.78,33.21,26.36,23.67,21.28,84.66,69.25,55.56,12.6,7.04,1.72,0.63,3.83,0.23,0.63,5.56,16.59,8.37,1.17,13.07,10.33,4.3,6.1,1.1,17.92,5.63,5.09,2.5,0.7,0.78,1.02,16.98,0.47,16.35,2.82,2.27,2.11,5.95,0.78,4.85,0.23,2.43,1.41,0.94,0.63,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,9.39,3.13,0.16,0,0.16,0.08,1.64,6.18,0,0,0,0.31,1.49,0,0,1.49,4.93,0,0,4.62,0.94,0,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.25,0.16,0.86,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,0.08,5.01,6.49,0.23,1.88,3.6,0.31,0.16,0.31,3.21,1.64,5.56,3.21,0.31,0.16,0.16,0,0,17.21,6.03,2.74,0.16,0.08,1.33,6.89,

Moved to Elasticsearch - Change in function of Activity and Content Feeds?,"After so many years of putting it off I've finally migrated to Elasticsearch. Can't believe I waited this long, as choosing a local AWS server has seriously sped up general use of the forums and functions.



	However, since I did this some members are complaining about a change in the way Unread Content, and View New Posts is working.



	Apparently, prior, these would just show the last post in a thread, whereas since enabling Elasticsearch, Unread Content will return every single unread post in a thread.

	Yes, if you provide the security answers in the notes section of the Client Area Access DetailsIf you do this, 100 percent confirm you login as the support account using the info on file including the security questions. Make sure the info is spot on to avoid delays in getting help.Just as a note to future readers of this topic, the issue looks to be by the Elastisearch provider not allowing access to the task and update by query APIs.



	If you get any odd issues with multiple entries where there shouldn't be in streams, it's almost always update by query not working or being blocked by the host.Thanks for the update. In that case, Bonsai is not suitable for an Elasticsearch/Invision integration as you've discovered (on anything less than their $700/month plans).

Multiline editing in Visual Studio Code,"Is it possible to enable multiline editing like in Sublime Text? For example, press Ctrl to place additional cursor carets and being able to write/delete on multiple places in the document at one time.On Windows, you hold Ctrl+Alt while pressing the up ↑ or down ↓ arrow keys to add cursors.
Mac: ⌥ Opt+⌘ Cmd+↑/↓
Linux: Shift+Alt+↑/↓

Note that third-party software may interfere with these shortcuts, preventing them from working as intended (particularly Intel's HD Graphics software on Windows; see comments for more details).
If you experience this issue, you can either disable the Intel/other software hotkeys, or modify the VS Code shortcuts (described below).

Press Esc to reset to a single cursor.

Or, as Isidor Nikolic points out, you can hold Alt and left click to place cursors arbitrarily.

You can view and edit keyboard shortcuts via:

File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts

Documentation:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings
Official VS Code Keyboard shortcut cheat sheets:
https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf

https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf

https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdfYou can just Alt + click for additional cursors. And as already mentioned, Ctrl + Alt + ↑ or   ↓.I wanted to select multiple lines and hit ""something"" to have a cursor for each select lines (similar to Ctrl + Shift + L in Sublime Text). This action in Visual Studio Code is called ""Add Cursors to Line Ends"".
This was tested in Visual Studio Code 1.51.1 and works on both Windows and Mac.
Here is the way:

Select the lines you want to have multiple cursors.
Simply hit Alt + Shift-I.

You now have one cursor per selected line.Use Ctrl + D to use multi word edit of same words in Windows and Linux.

Use CMD + D for Mac.From the version 1.13 (May 2017) you can finally change the default modifier key for creating multiple cursors (add to settings):

""editor.multiCursorModifier"": ""ctrlCmd""


P.S.: The modifier ""follow link"" from this moment will be Alt.In the latest release of Visual Studio Code, you can now drag the cursor while holding Option (Alt on Windows) to select the same column on multiple rows.

To enable this, make sure you change your editor.multiCursorModifier to look like this:

""editor.multiCursorModifier"": ""ctrlCmd""


From the Visual Studio Code release notes 1.32.0:


  In the following video, the selection begins as a regular selection and then Alt is pressed and held until the mouse button is released:Step 1: 
 

Select the word to be replaced. 


Step 2:
Use Ctrl + F to select its multiple occurrences.

Step 3: 
 

Use Alt + Enter to set cursor at all the found occurrences.

Step 4: 


Just start typing the new word.

Alternatively on Mac: 


⌥ Opt + Click to set cursor on the click location.On Mac it is:

Option + Command while pressing the up ↑ or down ↓ arrow keys.I am using the vscodevim extension, so I'm not sure if this is a common problem. But, I was having the issue where Ctrl + Alt + UpArrow flipped my screen upside down.

Looking at the Visual Studio Code Basics (I don't know if they changed this in a recent update), it says to use:

Ctrl + Alt + Shift + (Up/down)Working solution for me was first selecting the required text to edit and then using CTRL + F2 to select all matching data in the page.
You may also use CTRL+Shift+L as suggested by @lesterCovax


  Please Note: The above solution uses the inherent ability of VSCode editor to select similar text across the entire page, and therefore, be careful.


For me the above solution of Ctrl + ALT + Arrowkeys did not work as it caused the screen to change its display orientation against selecting the lines in VSCode.(Windows 10 pro x64) Here have some ways!


Alt + click
Alt + Ctrl + up/down
Keybindings: Ctrl + click (??? it doesn't work!)As of April 2018 (version 1.23) you can now also use the middle mouse button to multiline select / box select.To add multiple cursors at any text position
This is done by using Ctrl+Click. Firstly you have to enable Multiple-Cursor Modifier. Simply type this option on Command Palette by Ctrl+Shift+P to enable it.

To remove a cursor form multiple text position.
Do Ctrl+Click on the cursor.version 1.43 (February 2020)
You can now toggle column selection mode, which changes mouse gestures and arrow keys, via:

Menu Bar > Selection > Column Selection Mode
Ctrl+Shift+P (Show All Commands) > Toggle Column Selection Mode
Bind your key for command ""editor.action.toggleColumnSelection""


Note: There is a ""Column Selection"" panel in the status bar after activation, which you can press to disable it again.According to VS Code 1.55.2 version(2021) under User > Commonly Used section there is an option as Multi Cursor Modifier. See below image.

for multi cursor default key is alt if you want it can change to Ctrl.
Moreover, for suitable places, you can hold the Middle Mouse button and move to down.In addition to all of the answers, there is one more way. Select the lines you want and then press:


Windows: Shift + Alt + i
Mac: shift + option + i


This puts a cursor in every row in the selection.In Windows, the below combinations work for me:


Ctrl + Shift + Alt + down arrow
Ctrl + Shift + Alt + up arrowIn Visual Studio Code just press Alt and place your cursor to the edit place(where you want to edit) and right click to select.(NO MOUSE) For macOS, I found this to be very quick!

CMD + f  To search the (word) you want to change.
Option + Enter To select all word you search for.

Just update the first word and it will update all the selected.I think it depends on your Visual Studio Code version.
Mine is Linux version Visual Studio Code 1.7.2.
{ ""key"": ""ctrl+shift+up"",         ""command"": ""editor.action.insertCursorAbove"",
                                     ""when"": ""editorTextFocus"" },
{ ""key"": ""shift+alt+up"",          ""command"": ""editor.action.insertCursorAbove"",
                                     ""when"": ""editorTextFocus"" },
{ ""key"": ""ctrl+shift+down"",       ""command"": ""editor.action.insertCursorBelow"",
                                     ""when"": ""editorTextFocus"" },
{ ""key"": ""shift+alt+down"",        ""command"": ""editor.action.insertCursorBelow"",
                                     ""when"": ""editorTextFocus"" }

The point is the shortcuts are not same in all machines, so you should check your configuration. Go to menu:

Menu File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts

Search for editor.action.insertCursorAbove and editor.action.insertCursorBelow and see your current configurations. You may change them if they conflict with operating system's shortcut keys.If you're using Linux, there's a possibility of a conflict with Alt + click, which is the default for ""moving a window"".

You can go to menu Settings → Window Behavior → Window Behavior → Actions tab

Just remove Alt + left (hold) and it will work.

This is the best way, because you don't need to hold two + keys to do such a simple task.I am using the Sublime Text keymap and the keybinding provided by the top answer did not seem to work :( Could be some conflicts between Visual Studio Code and sublime keymaps.

The keybinding recommended by @Han works for me (much appreciated!):


Enter multiline cursor mode with Ctrl + Shift + Up/Down
Exit with Esc




(Sidenote) Below is a small example of using Emmet together with the multiline cursor (enabled and disabled with these key bindings listed above):I am using the latest version of VS code i.e., 1.46.1 (May 2020) in Windows 10. Just press Alt+mouse left click on the lines you want to select. This will let you select multiple lines at once and let you edit them. Also Press Esc to exit from it.
This is really helpful if you're coming from sublime text.My settings: Windows 8.1 64 bits, Visual Studio Code version 1.33.1.

Problem: Conflict with keyboard shortcuts of Intel HD Graphics 4000

I had a problem when I was using the default shortcuts of the Visual Studio Code (Ctrl + Alt + UP, Ctrl + Alt + DOWN). In my case, these commands were turning my screen in 0º and 180º respectively. It's happening, because there is the Graphic Intel application installed on my computer. Then, I just disable the shortcuts of this application.

Here is an tutorial to help someone.On windows, you can create additional cursor on the next/previous lines by pressing:
Ctrl + Alt + Shift +Down/Up
Missing the Shift will flip your screen.
Creating additional cursors will allow you to edit multiple lines at once.Just Opt + click works for me on MacThe solution from @maxime of using SHIFT + ALT + i worked for me, when I needed to quickly edit ~20k lines in a file.  Most of the other keyboard shortcuts mentioned are only useful for a limited number of line.  SHIFT selecting the area you want to column edit, then pressing SHIFT + ALT + i is the most efficient way to handle this.

What I accidentally discovered though, (and hasn't been mentioned here yet) is that there is a limit of 10k lines in ""cursor edit mode"" (there's an open Github feature request to increase it).  This means that for extremely large files, it may be better to script your edits, rather than doing it manually.

For those like @specimen that had to use shortcuts like CTRL + SHIFT + L (default binding is Select all occurrences of current selection) to accomplish this, you should check that you don't have a keymap extension installed.  You can check by searching for @recommended:keymaps in the extensions pane, going to File > Preferences > Keymaps (CTRL+K CTRL+M).

The default [Windows] keymap can be found in PDF form HERE, or you can go to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts to find/modify the current bindings.  There is also more in-depth key bindings documentation HERE.For me  Alt +  Middle Click (scroll wheel) worked fine
You have to click on Alt then long click on  Middle Click then scroll Up  or downSolved using just two steps!

Ctrl + F

Alt + Enter


It's equal to Sublime Text's Alt + F3.Box Selecting

My webpage does not load correctly,"Good morning, I would really appreciate your help.



	On my site they redirected everything to chapala.com without the ""www"" (www.chapala.com), and now they only load some pages in my webboard and not others.

	My question is. Do I need to change the Licensed URL I have from http://www.chapala.com/webboard to https://chapala.com/webboard?



	Thank youTry updating the ""board_url"" in your conf_global.php file to match.  Then also click on the ""Clear System Cache"" from the Support page in Admin CP.



	The licensed url wont prevent your site from working, just upgrades and such. But yes, you may need to update it.Let's back up one step. 🙂



	You said ""they redirected everything to"" your URL.



	That is not the way the software needs to work.



	Any and all redirects from domain.com to www.domain.com (or vice-versa) must be removed. Please ask your Host to do so.



	Then the board_url (or board_name) variable in your conf_global.php file needs to be set to the URL you are using. 



	Your registered URL does include www. and we do recommend you use that. 



	Once that URL is correct, save, then login directly to your admin panel and visit the Support page, and click the button on the right to clear the system cache.



	Does that resolve the issue?Thank you Richard, yes, it worked.



	Thank you very much!",,,,,1,240,53.47,84.23,19.26,72.45,13.33,14.58,74.17,60.42,50,14.17,10.42,2.5,0.83,5.83,0,1.25,3.75,15.42,6.25,0.83,10.83,7.08,3.75,6.25,1.25,13.75,2.92,2.08,2.5,1.25,1.25,0,12.08,2.08,10,1.25,1.25,2.92,2.08,1.25,3.33,0,5,4.17,0.83,1.67,0.83,0.83,0,0,0,0,15,6.25,3.33,2.5,0,0,2.5,8.75,0,0,0,0.42,2.5,0,0,2.5,2.5,0,0,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.42,0,5.42,5,0,0.42,4.58,0,0,0,4.17,0.83,4.17,0.83,1.67,0.83,0.83,0,0,27.08,11.67,3.75,0.83,0.42,0.42,10,
"Naming Classes - How to avoid calling everything a ""<WhatEver>Manager""? [closed]","It sounds like a slippery slope to something that'd be posted on thedailywtf.com, ""ManagerOfPeopleWhoHaveMortgages"", etc.

I suppose it's right that one monolithic Manager class is not good design, but using 'Manager' is not bad. Instead of UserManager we might break it down to UserAccountManager, UserProfileManager, UserSecurityManager, etc. 

'Manager' is a good word because it clearly shows a class is not representing a real-world 'thing'. 'AccountsClerk' - how am I supposed to tell if that's a class which manages user data, or represents someone who is an Accounts Clerk for their job?Being au fait with patterns as defined by (say) the GOF book, and naming objects after these gets me a long way in naming classes, organising them and communicating intent. Most people will understand this nomenclature (or at least a major part of it).I think the most important thing to keep in mind is: is the name descriptive enough? Can you tell by looking at the name what the Class is supposed to do? Using words like ""Manager"", ""Service"" or ""Handler"" in your class names can be considered too generic, but since a lot of programmers use them it also helps understanding what the class is for.

I myself have been using the facade-pattern a lot (at least, I think that's what it is called). I could have a User class that describes just one user, and a Users class that keeps track of my ""collection of users"". I don't call the class a UserManager because I don't like managers in real-life and I don't want to be reminded of them :) Simply using the plural form helps me understand what the class does.Specific to C#, I found ""Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries"" to have lots of good information on the logic of naming.

As far as finding those more specific words though, I often use a thesaurus and jump through related words to try and find a good one.  I try not to spend to much time with it though, as I progress through development I come up with better names, or sometimes realize that SuchAndSuchManager should really be broken up into multiple classes, and then the name of that deprecated class becomes a non-issue.I believe the critical thing here is to be consistent within the sphere of your code's visibility, i.e. as long as everyone who needs to look at/work on your code understands your naming convention then that should be fine, even if you decide to call them 'CompanyThingamabob' and 'UserDoohickey'. The first stop, if you work for a company, is to see if there is a company convention for naming. If there isn't or you don't work for a company then create your own using terms that make sense to you, pass it around a few trusted colleagues/friends who at least code casually, and incorporate any feedback that makes sense.

Applying someone else's convention, even when it's widely accepted, if it doesn't leap off the page at you is a bit of a mistake in my book. First and foremost I need to understand my code without reference to other documentation but at the same time it needs to be generic enough that it's no incomprehensible to someone else in the same field in the same industry.I'd consider the patterns you are using for your system, the naming conventions / cataloguing / grouping of classes of  tends to be defined by the pattern used.  Personally, I stick to these naming conventions as they are the most likely way for another person to be able to pick up my code and run with it.

For example UserRecordsClerk might be better explained as extending a generic RecordsClerk interface that both UserRecordsClerk and CompanyRecordsClerk implement and then specialise on, meaning one can look at the methods in the interface to see what the its subclasses do / are generally for.

See a book such as Design Patterns for info, it's an excellent book and might help you clear up where you're aiming to be with your code - if you aren't already using it! ;o) 

I reckon so long as your pattern is well chosen and used as far as is appropriate, then pretty uninventive straightforward class names should suffice!",,,,,1,710,53.66,36.83,39.26,55.29,33.81,20.28,85.63,70.28,57.75,14.51,7.61,3.66,0.14,2.54,0,0.85,6.9,15.21,7.18,0.85,15.07,9.58,3.8,8.03,1.69,18.17,5.77,4.37,3.66,0.99,1.69,0.99,17.89,0.28,17.32,3.94,2.54,2.68,3.66,0.42,4.65,0.14,3.38,2.82,0.56,0.99,0.85,0.14,0,0,0,0,10,2.82,0.42,0,0,0,1.83,6.76,0,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.76,0.14,0,6.48,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.56,0.14,0.42,0,0.42,0,0,0,0.14,5.77,6.48,0.28,0.85,4.37,0.85,0.14,0.28,1.83,1.41,7.18,1.13,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,17.89,3.52,4.65,0.42,0.28,4.23,4.79,
Need CSS 3 Software,"I am developing a web interface and would like to make it beautiful with CSS3. I am not using HTML5. The page will be having styling like border radius and gradient. I want a software which validates (and supports) CSS3 styling like -moz-border-radius. Lot of online tools are there, but I want a software that can be installed in my PC (to work offline). I am expecting the software to automatically apply -moz-border and webkit border both (I mean all possible variations and adaptations) for a single control of border radius, all CSS gradient syntax automatically for a gradient control etc. In short I want a software which gives my complete control over CSS3, friendly for a beginner not knowing the syntax. The software may not just use autocomplete since one have to learn the syntax to use, but have controls or options to implement styles over some elements like <div>, <span> etc. The software may support WYSWYG editing of web page including live page preview (Something like Style Master). The software may also notify about multiple browser compatibility. Help me choose right software.I m not sure if any editor will automatically apply the webkit declaration when you type in the moz declaration. Having said that, you can try Komodo Edit (it's free and platform independent) which supports all the CSS3 styles and will offer to auto-complete it for you as you start typing the initial few letters of the CSS3 property.

Another thing I d like to add here is, of course this will only solve the border radius issue, you can use the jquery corner plugin wherein you specify the selector and assign the corner function to it like this

$("".button"").corner();


This will apply the moz, webkit etc declarations at run time automatically based on the browser accessing it. There are more ways you can use the corner plugin too. 

$("".button"").corner('5px'); //specify border radius


or

$("".button"").corner('tl tr'); //apply border radius only to top left and top right

Need help upgrading from IP.Board 3.4.7 to most current version for two boards,"Need help upgrading from IP.Board 3.4.7 to the most current version 4.7.1 for two boards.  Both licenses are up to date.



	In the past we've needed tech support to complete major version upgrades, we've ensured that the latest versions of PHP, MySQL, etc. are in place via the compatibility checker.



	Help!Do you need help with any specific thing regarding the upgrade, or for the whole thing?



	First of all make a backup of the database and forum files/folders, download Ipb 4.7.1. and overwrite your current forum files with it. Then run the upgrader.



	If you want to hire someone to do the upgrade for you instead, please feel free to contact me.Yeah, a bit more info on what kind of help you need would be better to understand your request. For example: do you need help only updating the forum or also other 3rd party modifications? If you don't want to post it here for everyone to see be sure to include it if you contact someone.

	The system notification does not work with commerce support reply.



	Is there any way to demonstrate to the member that a new response has been entered in support?Are you referring to the support ticket system in Commerce? 



	There are two options to alert the user when a ticket has been successfully created:



		If they created the ticket via the software UI, they can actually view the ticket 🙂 .
	
	
		If they created a ticket by emailing in, you can have the system send an email back to let them know it was received. This can be done in ACP -> Commerce -> Support -> Settings -> Outgoing Emails tab -> Send received confirmation?

	Yes emails are notified normally, but when the community is used by players of rpg games or any other type of game this type of notification is the same thing as nothing, players hate using emails.

Zero One Infinity High Cohesion - How focused are the responsibilities of the modules you are designing.

Low Coupling - The degree to which modules rely on other modules.KISSChose composition over inheritance, is one.

Many people, especially those new to OO will start extending classes when all they really need to is to use composition. Really if you should ask your self, is the new class B a Class A? If not then you shouldn't extend.

For example, let's say I have a Person Class, a Car Class, and I would like to make a new class called a DrivenCar class. A naive implementation would be to say (let's pretend we got multiple inheritance)

class DrivenCar extends Person, Car  { ... }


Is the DrivenCar a type of Person? No so it shouldn't be extending Person. Is the DrivenCar a Car? yes so it makes sense to extend

Using composition the implmentation would look like 

class DrivenCar extends Car {
    private Person driver;
}The GRASP patterns.  Yes, they seem rather trivial.  More like distillation down to core qualities that other, more involved patterns demonstrate.YAGNIInterface.

"OS X Bash, 'watch' command","I'm looking for the best way to duplicate the Linux 'watch' command on Mac OS X. I'd like to run a command every few seconds to pattern match on the contents of an output file using 'tail' and 'sed'. What's my best option on a Mac, and can it be done without downloading software?With Homebrew installed:

brew install watchYou can emulate the basic functionality with the shell loop:

while :; do clear; your_command; sleep 2; done


That will loop forever, clear the screen, run your command, and wait two seconds - the basic watch your_command implementation.

You can take this a step further and create a watch.sh script that can accept your_command and sleep_duration as parameters:

#!/bin/bash
# usage: watch.sh <your_command> <sleep_duration>

while :; 
  do 
  clear
  date
  $1
  sleep $2
doneUse MacPorts:
$ sudo port install watchThe shells above will do the trick, and you could even convert them to an alias (you may need to wrap in a function to handle parameters):
alias myWatch='_() { while :; do clear; $2; sleep $1; done }; _'

Examples:
myWatch 1 ls ## Self-explanatory
myWatch 5 ""ls -lF $HOME"" ## Every 5 seconds, list out home directory; double-quotes around command to keep its arguments together

Alternately, Homebrew can install the watch from http://procps.sourceforge.net/:
brew install watchIt may be that ""watch"" is not what you want.  You probably want to ask for help in solving your problem, not in implementing your solution!  :)

If your real goal is to trigger actions based on what's seen from the tail command, then you can do that as part of the tail itself.  Instead of running ""periodically"", which is what watch does, you can run your code on demand.

#!/bin/sh

tail -F /var/log/somelogfile | while read line; do
  if echo ""$line"" | grep -q '[Ss]ome.regex'; then
    # do your stuff
  fi
done


Note that tail -F will continue to follow a log file even if it gets rotated by newsyslog or logrotate.  You want to use this instead of the lower-case tail -f.  Check man tail for details.

That said, if you really do want to run a command periodically, the other answers provided can be turned into a short shell script:

#!/bin/sh
if [ -z ""$2"" ]; then
  echo ""Usage: $0 SECONDS COMMAND"" >&2
  exit 1
fi

SECONDS=$1
shift 1
while sleep $SECONDS; do
  clear
  $*
doneI am going with the answer from here:
bash -c 'while [ 0 ]; do <your command>; sleep 5; done'

But you're really better off installing watch as this isn't very clean...If watch doesn't want to install via 

brew install watch


There is another similar/copy version that installed and worked perfectly for me

brew install visionmedia-watch


https://github.com/tj/watchOr, in your ~/.bashrc file:
function watch {
    while :; do clear; date; echo; $@; sleep 2; done
}To prevent flickering when your main command takes perceivable time to complete, you can capture the output and only clear screen when it's done.
function watch {while :; do a=$($@); clear; echo ""$(date)\n\n$a""; sleep 1;  done}

Then use it by:
watch istatsTry this:

#!/bin/bash
# usage: watch [-n integer] COMMAND

case $# in
    0)
        echo ""Usage $0 [-n int] COMMAND""
        ;;
    *)      
        sleep=2;
        ;;
esac    

if [ ""$1"" == ""-n"" ]; then
    sleep=$2
    shift; shift
fi


while :; 
    do 
    clear; 
    echo ""$(date) every ${sleep}s $@""; echo 
    $@; 
    sleep $sleep; 
doneHere's a slightly changed version of this answer that:


checks for valid args
shows a date and duration title at the top
moves the ""duration"" argument to be the 1st argument, so complex commands can be easily passed as the remaining arguments.

Odd behavior after 4.7.1 upgrade,"I recently updated to 4.7.1 after the site being dormant for almost a year. I tried disabling all customizations, including deleting an outdated theme and also cleared system cache from the support menu. When I clicked on my avatar in the top right, `#elUserLink_menu` got appended to the URL bar but nothing happened (no popups and also a lot of JS errors in console) Clearing my browser cache seems to have fixed the popup menu not appearing but clicking AdminCP from the dropdown just opens a new ""about: blank"" tab in Chrome. I have tried downloading my IPS suite and rsync'd it over into my html directory, cleared cache again but no luck. I am still getting a few JavaScript errors and the site is taking around 15 seconds to load. As part of the 4.7.1 upgrade, I also switched over to PHP 8.1 (from 7.4) and enabled CRON tasks. I haven't touched this software much in the past couple of years and don't know where to start. Help is appreciated!Want to comment that your server seems to be running extremely slow at the moment. Even pages in the ACP and login pages, which are not remotely resource intensive, are taking several seconds to load.



	Your maintenance tasks are not running via your setup CRON so I set those back to traffic.



	Right now, you have Javascript errors which are preventing anything that runs Javascript to run. You will want to keep all third party add-ons disabled and ensure that the following folders are writable on your server:



		applications
	
	
		datastore
	
	
		plugins
	
	
		uploads and all sub-folders of uploads
	

	Once that is done, please clear cache in ACP -> Support. If you continue to have issues, please provide us FTP access in the client area.Making those directories writable seems to have sped up the site. Looks like I had messed up ownership when using rsync for the manual update.



	The JS errors still remain despite all customizations being disabled. I have updated the access credentials. Thank you for the help!It looks like there are still issues in terms of permissions. Please check that your uploads directory and all its subdirectories are writable in the first instance. 



	The other thing that can cause issues is if you are using suPHP/suExec and have files that are set to 0666, these can be blocked from being used on the server.I'm running php-fpm 8.1 with nginx on Debian 10. Both nginx and php-fpm are configured to run as www-data. Permissions are as follow:

	`/var/www/html/<REDACTED>.com` is `root:www-data` because of the sftp chroot I had set up for support (it was `www-data:www-data` before). I have su'd as www-data and can confirm read/write access to all directories listed in Jim's post. 



	I feel like the permissions are all correct. Is there a way for me to check permissions to these directories within the AdminCP or similar?

	Edited September 3 by sirspiderSorry for the bump but I cannot seem to be able to edit my previous post anymore.



	It turns out the Steam integration plugin I had was still causing some errors despite it being disabled so I went ahead and deleted both disabled plugins I had, no luck.



	I tried creating a new theme in case the default one was broken. I could not get past the ""save"" button. When I went back, there were many new themes with a generic name. I tried deleting all of them, including the default theme. I am now getting an error due to no themes existing at all. I don't know why or how I was able to do that.



	Enabling dev mode seems to work and I was able to create a new theme with it enabled. While it's enabled, I also don't see any of the `ips is not defined` / `jQuery is not defined` JavaScript errors. They come back as soon as I disable dev mode.So since it seemed that all of this started after a failed upgrade, I decided to update to the current beta version. It took quite a while to update but now everything seems to be in order. I will update you once more if I run into any more issues.No problem. Glad to hear that resolved the issues for you. It will likely be because it will have removed a lot of the cached data and rebuilt it during the upgrade (thus changing permissions to whatever the default would be).

"Official reasons for ""Software caused connection abort: socket write error""","Given this stack trace snippet Caused by: java.net.SocketException:
  Software caused connection abort:
  socket write error 
 at
  java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite0(Native
  Method) I tried to answer the following questions: Regarding #1: Sun's JVM source doesn't contain this exact message, but I think the text Software caused connection abort: socket write error is from the native implementation of SocketOutputStream: Regarding #2 My guess is that it is caused when the client has terminated the connection, before getting the full response (e.g. sent a request, but before getting the full response, it got closed / terminated / offline) Questions: I need to have a proof that this stack trace is the socket client's ""fault"", and there is nothing that the server could have done to avoid it. (except catching the exception, or using a non Sun JVM SocketOutputStream, though both don't really avoid the fact the client has terminated)This error can occur when the local network system aborts a
  connection, such as when WinSock closes an established connection
  after data retransmission fails (receiver never acknowledges data sent
  on a datastream socket).


See this MSDN article. See also Some information about 'Software caused connection abort'.The java.net.SocketException is thrown when there is an error creating or accessing a socket (such as TCP). This usually can be caused when the server has terminated the connection (without properly closing it), so before getting the full response. In most cases this can be caused either by the timeout issue (e.g. the response takes too much time or server is overloaded with the requests), or the client sent the SYN, but it didn't receive ACK (acknowledgment of the connection termination). For timeout issues, you can consider increasing the timeout value.

The Socket Exception usually comes with the specified detail message about the issue.

Example of detailed messages:



  Software caused connection abort: recv failed.


The error indicates an attempt to send the message and the connection has been aborted by your server. If this happened while connecting to the database, this can be related to using not compatible Connector/J JDBC driver.

Possible solution: Make sure you've proper libraries/drivers in your CLASSPATH.

  Software caused connection abort: connect.


This can happen when there is a problem to connect to the remote. For example due to virus-checker rejecting the remote mail requests.

Possible solution: Check Virus scan service whether it's blocking the port for the outgoing requests for connections.

  Software caused connection abort: socket write error.


Possible solution: Make sure you're writing the correct length of bytes to the stream. So double check what you're sending. See this thread.

  Connection reset by peer: socket write error / Connection aborted by peer: socket write error


The application did not check whether keep-alive connection had been timed out on the server side.

Possible solution: Ensure that the HttpClient is non-null before reading from the connection.E13222_01

  Connection reset by peer.


The connection has been terminated by the peer (server).

  Connection reset.


The connection has been either terminated by the client or closed by the server end of the connection due to request with the request.

See: What's causing my java.net.SocketException: Connection reset?I have seen this most often when a corporate firewall on a workstation/laptop gets in the way, it kills the connection.

eg. I have a server process and a client process on the same machine. The server is listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) and the client attempts a connection to the public/home interface (note not the loopback interface 127.0.0.1).

If the machine is has its network disconnected (eg wifi turned off) then the connection is formed. If the machine is connected to the corporate network (directly or vpn) then the connection is formed.

However, if the machine is connected to a public wifi (or home network) then the firewall kicks in an kills the connection. In this situation connecting the client to the loopback interface works fine, just not to the home/public interface.

Hope this helps.To prove which component fails I would monitor the TCP/IP communication using wireshark and look who is actaully closing the port, also timeouts could be relevant.For anyone using simple Client Server programms and getting this error, it is a problem of unclosed (or closed to early) Input or Output Streams.Have you checked the Tomcat source code and the JVM source ? That may give you more help.

I think your general thinking is good. I would expect a ConnectException in the scenario that you couldn't connect. The above looks very like it's client-driven.I was facing the same issue.

Commonly This kind of error occurs due to client has closed its connection and server still trying to write on that client.

So make sure that your client has its connection open until server done with its outputstream.

And one more thing, Don`t forgot to  close input and output stream.

Hope this helps.

  On SoapUI go to:
  
  File-->Preferences--Socket Timeout(ms)


...and put a large value, such as 180000 (3 minutes), this won't be the perfect fix for your issue because the file is in fact to large, but at least you will have a response.Closed connection in another client

In my case, the error was:

java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: recv failed


It was received in eclipse while debugging a java application accessing a H2 database. The source of the error was that I had initially opened the database with SQuirreL to check manually for integrity. I did use the flag to enable multiple connections to the same DB (i.e. AUTO_SERVER=TRUE), so there was no problem connecting to the DB from java.

The error appeared when, after a while --it is a long java process-- I decided to close SQuirreL to free resources. It appears as if SQuirreL were the one ""owning"" the DB server instance and that it was shut down with the SQuirreL connection.

Restarting the Java application did not yield the error again.

when classes in client and server are different. I don't download server's classes (Interfaces) on the client, I juste add same files in the project.
But the path must be exactly the same.
For example, on the server project I have java\rmi\services packages with some serviceInterface and implementations, I have to create the same package on the client project. If I change it by java/rmi/server/services for example, I get the above exception.
Same exception if the interface version is different between client and server (even with an empty row added inadvertently ... I think rmi makes a sort of hash of classes to check version ... I don't know...

	Yeah, I filled it with some images (I am talking about the Gallery and not the forum) to test the functionalities. I guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow to ask IPS to reset that.You have nothing set on your live installation, so there would be nothing stopping you from installing this. If its live you are now doing you would not add -TESTINSTALL to the end. Please could you clarify what issue you are having?On 8/22/2022 at 3:35 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

	I had made a test installation on site A, without identifying as -TESTINSTALL, so when I wanted to try it on the real site (B), it would not let me. Since I had only played with the Site A installation with a dozen images in 3 categories and 2 members to test, I figured it would be as simple to remove both (from Sites A and B) to start from scratch. I reset the licence and I think I am set up correctly now with the -TESTINSTALL on Site A. Then, I should be able to add it to Site B without issue.



	So, I think I have solved my issue with answers from this thread.You have indeed if you have done what you said there. This is why Im not seeing any issues.

Open source URL shortening software? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 9 years ago. Are there any open source URL shortening software projects out there? Perhaps something that works in conjunction with Apache?A lot of them popped up when I did a search on Github:

https://github.com/search?langOverride=&q=url+shortener&repo=&start_value=1&type=RepositoriesDoes this Count? http://code.google.com/p/urly/

or this http://yourls.org/Firefly claims it can be up & running in 2 minutes: https://github.com/ariejan/firefly#readme

Here are some other suggestions: http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/7-open-source-and-free-url-shortener-scripts-to-create-your-own/You could do it yourself easily enough with a database. Just store each long url in the database as a key and the short one as a value. You could easily create a short one with an auto-increment field in your table. Your urls would look like this:

http://mysite.com/12345

In your server side programming language of choice, just do a look up into the table, and then do a redirect.I use http://yourls.org/ in my shortener, very powerful and plugin enabled. You can also easily create your own pages with stats and stuff.

OpenGL software rendering alternatives,"I need to software render OpenGL in Windows and have already found about Mesa3D, which doesn't provide DLLs and I'm having some pain to build... Are there alternatives available?That depends on what OpenGL version you wish to accelerate. Depending on your needs, there are some alternatives available. I've listed those I'm aware of below:

OpenGL 1.0 & 1.1

Windows (since Windows NT 3.5) actually includes an OpenGL software implementation to begin with. If you haven't installed any other software rasterizer, this ought to be your default implementation. The Microsoft software rasterizer supports either OpenGL 1.0 or 1.1, depending on your platform, but will not accelerate anything newer than that. If your desired OpenGL version is covered by 1.0 or 1.1 (however unlikely), the solution should be sufficient. I'm unsure as to what extent the default Windows OpenGL software implementation covers the OpenGL ES 1.x frameworks through its OpenGL 1.0 or 1.1 support.

OpenGL 1.4

Furthermore, in Windows Vista, Microsoft included an emulation layer which may translate OpenGL into Direct3D; thus supporting up-to OpenGL 1.4. Additionally, this should mean that Windows Vista (and up?) runtimes may accelerate most parts of OpenGL SC. I've never used this emulator myself, and was quite surprised to hear about it, but it may be of interest to someone having to run one of these old frameworks in a Windows environment.
Note that the standard Windows OpenGL software rasterizer (OpenGL 1.0 or 1.1) is also included in Windows Vista and above.

OpenGL ES 2.0

Additionally, there's the ANGLE project which accelerates WebGL and OpenGL ES 2.0 by translating OpenGL ES 2.0 invocations to DirectX 9 and 11. Their development notes also mention that an OpenGL ES 3.0 solution is in the works. Never having used ANGLE, I cannot offer a verdict.

OpenGL 3.1

In addition to those mentioned above, Mesa 3D (which supports up to OpenGL 3.1) feature three software implementations:


swrast
softpipe
llvmpipe


Since I know very little of swrast (the original Mesa project software rasterizer) and softpipe (a reference driver) I'll refrain from going into these. The third implementation, llvmpipe, and probably the one that may interest you the most, is a high-speed software implementation that uses multithreading and JIT compilation to speed up simulation with native- and SIMD instructions.I have used Swiftshader from Transgaming for a production project before and I must say, it was brilliant. A tad costly, but brilliant.As far as I've searched, the only other option is using WebGL software renderer, that as of today only Chrome supports. Direct3D has the reference driver (which is really unstable) and Swiftshader, which is good and expensive. 

After some more headaches I managed to build Mesa3D for Windows, but only an old version which had still some support for it. At least, it has an awesome performance.I need to software render OpenGL in Windows and have already found about Mesa3D, which doesn't provide DLLs and I'm having some pain to build...

PHP + MySQL software,"Netbeans has PHP highlighting, code completition, db manager and ftp/sftp + xdebug (your next step:) ) support.Try Eclipse.  Go here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ it is the third one down in the list (platforms on the right).  You can connect to DB's, have intelli-sense (code completion) and more all for FREE!Have you looked at Zend Studio?If you don't want to spend as much as Zend Studio ($399 one year) try Aptana Studio. It is free and for $99 you get the Pro version with extra features like SFTP support.

There is a stand-alone version and an Eclipse plugin.When I'm forced to use Windows, JEdit is my editor of choice. It has syntax highlighting for almost any language, FTP/SFTP remote editing, SQL plugins, code completion plugins, and so many others that I can't even begin to list them.

And, it's FOSS!

You can find the JEdit project at http://www.jedit.orgYour question is correctly tagged - you need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)! Dreamweaver wants to be one but unfortunately it isn't.

If you're on a Mac I highly recommend Coda.

For any platform; I've had a great experience with Aptana (a fork of Eclipse) and these open-source IDEs are just bursting with useful plugins. Even Aptana's default project templates were useful instead of fluff!

One guy in my team loves NetBeans to bits.

Right now I'm addicted to shelling into the server and using command-line tools like vi or nano, svn, mysql. A steep (and important) learning curve but everything is possible on the command line. And with minimal client requirements. Do anything from anywhere!

I think the true answer is subjective - you'll need to dive in and try each one to see how they fit your working style.

Hope that helps!My personal favorite text editor: e texteditor which a clone of a mac app called textmate.

There is a lot of support for many languages, although Zend Studio will give you more ""integration"" features.Need your suggestion on php/mysql software. I develop PHP websites using Dreamweaver, I also have to use phpmyadmin, sql query editor (to work with database) and WinSCP (to upload/backup files over SFTP).

PHP upgrade - v7.4 to v8.0 - server 500 error,"We are running bikes forum in Singapore and use invision software. we are on the latest release and asking us to update php from version 7.4.30 to version 8.0.0.



	 



	So we tried to upgrade it using Cpanel under multi php manager. We update that to version 8.0 and now the forum not reachable and giving a 500 error. 



	I reviewed few different topics on this in this forum and tried the suggested approaches.



	 



	I tried disabling the market place applications, I dont have any extra plugins and themes as well. What could be the issue?



	



	 



	Market place applications disabled to test this out and no luck.



	



	 



	 



	We tried upgrading to 8.1 as well but no luck, what are we missing is there any issue at all upgrading to 8.0 for most of the folks ?



	 



	Site is showing as below after upgrade to 8.0/8.1 hence we reverted back to 7.4 version again.

	Yes. Its purpose is that you can run it and see what is compatible. So its designed to do just thatI am able to get the results after applying php 8.0 and its failing due to below reasons.



	=========



		
			You do not have the cURL PHP extension loaded (or it is running a version less than 7.36) and the allow_url_fopen PHP setting is disabled. You should contact your hosting provider or system administrator to ask either for cURL version 7.36 or greater to be installed, to be installed or the allow_url_fopen setting enabled. cURL is recommended.
		
	
	
		
			You do not have the GD PHP extension loaded which is required. You should contact your hosting provider or system administrator to ask for it to be enabled.
		
	
	
		
			You do not have the Multibyte String PHP extension loaded which is required. You should contact your hosting provider or system administrator to ask for it to be installed.
		
	
	
		
			You do not have the MySQLi PHP extension loaded which is required. You should contact your hosting provider or system administrator to ask for it to be installed.
		
	
	
		
			Your PHP memory limit is too low. It needs to be set to 128M or more. You should contact your hosting provider or system administrator to ask for this to be changed.
		
	

	=========Those 5 items must be fixed by your Host, in either the server-wide php.ini file, or in an account-specific php.ini file as an override in your server account. They may need to recompile PHP to add some missing Extensions.



	Once that has been done, reload that page and check to see if the red items are now green.I have recently had this issue. Try installing and upgrading to 8.1 works so much better.I recently upgraded to 4.7 and 8.0.x on my business site, and everything is running fine.



	However, I tried it first on my test site by first upgrading to 4.7, then disabling all customisations, then upgrading to 8.0 and re-enabling things bit by bit and reloading the site - which helped me discover one or two apps/plugins which broke the upgraded test site so I could delete them on my production site.



	I tried 8.1 and it was working for a while but I now have to reinstall my test site as there are strange problems with trying to access the PHP *.sock file (I think switching FPM packages too often does this?).  Anyway, that's probably a general procedure to follow when making such important site updates.

	Upon further examination, I think I can save you some time. 🙂



	I think this happens when ips4.php is run on a site which does not yet have a mySQL database configured.  I'm using DirectAdmin, and I notice that once you create a first DB, only then does phpMyAdmin become available as a clickable button, so I think this has to be set up for mySQL to register with the ips4.php script.



	To this end, I ran the script on my production site (which obviously has all this set up) and everything displays fine.



	Hope this helps!That would explain why I couldnt replicate it. Thank you for letting us know 🙂 In reality, that is a very very niche scenario there and not something I would really see as being a bug. For example, if you didnt have PHP installed, the file wouldnt run at all 🙂We are able to sucessfully upgrade after we installed above extensions listed for php8.0 and php8.1



	 



	Now site is working on both php8.0 and php8.1, but we are on php8.0

Parallel software?,"What is the meaning of ""parallel software"" and what are the differences between ""parallel software"" and ""regular software""? What are its advantages and disadvantages? Does writing ""parallel software"" require a specific hardware or programming language ?Are the ""parallel software"" requires a specified hardware or programing language ?


Yes and Yes.  

The first one is trivially easy.  Most modern CPU's (Say anything newer than m6800) have hardware features that make it possible to do more than one thing at a time, though not necessarily both at the same time.  For instance, when a timer interrupt goes off, a CPU could save what it's doing, and then start doing something else.  Those tasks run concurrently.  

Even without that, you could just get two machines with some sort of connection to each other (like a simple serial connection via a Null modem adapter) and they can both work on the same task in parallel.  

Most new (not just modern but recent) CPU's have parallel computing resources built in.  These multi-core CPU's can actually be working on two or more tasks at the same time, one task per core, and have special features that make it a bit more efficient for those tasks to cooperate.  

The second one, requiring special software tools such as a parallel enabled language, is in some ways the hardest part of parallel computing.  If you're the only person in the kitchen, it's pretty easy to cook a meal, by following each recipe from start to finish, one after the next, until all dishes are cooked.  If you want to speed that up by adding more cooks, you have to be a bit more careful to not step on each other's toes.  

The simplest way this is handled is by using a threading library that offers some tools so that multiple tasks can arrange to not clobber each other.  This is not as easy as flagging a program as parallel and the system takes care of the rest, rather, you have to write each task to communicate with every other task at every place where there is the possibility of them interfering.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computer_science)


  In computer science, a thread of
  execution results from a fork of a
  computer program into two or more
  concurrently running tasks. The
  implementation of threads and
  processes differs from one operating
  system to another, but in most cases,
  a thread is contained inside a
  process. Multiple threads can exist
  within the same process and share
  resources such as memory, while
  different processes do not share these
  resources.


Most modern programming languages support multithreading in one way or another (even Javascript in the newest versions). :-)

Advantages and Disadvantages can depend on the task.  If you have a lot of processing that you need to do, then multithreading can help you break that up into smaller units of work that each CPU can work on independently at the same time.  However, multithreaded code will generally be more complex to write and maintain than single threaded code.

You can still write/run multithreaded code on a machine that has only one processor.  Although there will only be one processor to execute the tasks, the operating system will ensure that they happen simultaneously by rapidly switching context and executing a few instructions for each thread at a time.

Parental Control Software,"I have been developing a parental control software program for my company, but have run into a problem. The software uses policy listings stored in a MySQL DB to determine whether to block a website or not. It uses a local proxy. Each time a website is visited, the proxy sends that site to the server, then the server determines if the site should be blocked or not based on the settings for the user. The software is done, but there is one major problem. It takes too long for the address to be sent to the server, and the server's response to get back to the proxy. Browsing speed is slowed down a lot when using the software. Is there a better way to do this? The proxy is written in Python and everything on the server end is done in PHP.Are you caching the server's responses locally on the client?  If not, you should - it ought to speed things up considerably.

And if you're asking your server about each URL, you should only ask about the domain name, so that the number of requests per site goes down from lots to only one.

	A long implementation of this task begins when the FCP is measured. I put this topic here because there is a strange moment in the FCP time measured in the PSI test.

	Test 1 - measured FCP for 4G network - 2 sec, FCP time for 3G network 3.93 sec - this is relatively good

	Test 2 - FCP time for 4G - 3 sec, but FCP for 3G - over 7 sec,...

	- bad and other indicators

	Test 3 - FCP 4G - 1.5 sec, FCP 3G - 3.01 sec. - very good.

	These 3 tests are I done at an interval of 30 seconds



	This type of results are obtained consistently - in sequences of tests in different time range, but in all three variants of these tests - server is working OK, no delays from the server.



	Is there some php function that reports access from different G networks?PS. The same results are obtained in a performance test with the Chrome browser development tool.

	Now I did about 10 performance tests on your site - I will not upload pictures to accumulate unnecessarily - but time for this task in each test plays from 140 to 350 milliseconds.

	What does it do and what is that task, that is the question…:-)On 7/12/2022 at 9:37 AM,   Matt said:

	Email provider, in this instance, would be how you have configured to send emails. As you said PHP, you would need to contact your hosting provider to see if it is configured correctly and why the server is accepting it but not sending it. I'm afraid, once we hand off the email, we have no further control over it.Our host has been ... difficult to deal with.  I am just wondering if switching to SMTP would be a better choice, it is what I am leaning toward, establishing a ""no reply"" email box type thing and setting it up there in IPB.That would be something you need to decide on, I'm afraid. From the software perspective, all those work fine. It would just be up to your email provider, regardless, if we are passing mail successfully to it but it is not being delivered.

This inherently limits the IPS learning curve more and more by making a blanket rule to suggest switching to the stock theme and disabling all plugins (which happened in my last 3 support topics) - which maybe sometimes related and most of the time it's not related as the nature of the problem is totally different and such blanket rule end up frustrating the users even more who is already suffering from some pressing and urgent issue.



	It's like you visit a doctor for a headache and the receptionist wants your bank statement, passport, marriage certificate, change the font on your Gmail, change the color of your car, and then only he can forward you to the real doctor.



	I found the solution to this issue and it's THE CORE IPS bug - and not any third-party plugin, logo change or color change, or CDN system.



	I simply reach the solution by weighing the nature and intensity of the problem vs the reach of any plugin, theme or Cloudflare.

	Gentle reminder.I'm very sorry to hear you feel that way about our support team. While I fully understand your frustration (Its frustrating to myself when I have an issue I cant resolve), let me explain the situation from a support standpoint, in terms of your own site there.



	At present you have 19 applications which were not written by our team (3rd party), and 23 plugins. Any one of these could be causing issues on your site in various locations. You mentioned there about troubleshooting, and indeed switching these off for any developer would be the very first course of action in determining the cause of an issue. These 'hook' into 213 locations within our core code, and therefore can very much affect how things work, and cause bugs. We very much wish that wasn't the case ourselves, but unfortunately this is the case if you run modifications to your site.



	In addition to the above, while looking at your system in an aid to troubleshoot the issue, we would look at anything which may be 'likely' causes. You have many items which are out of date. That not only can lead to issues, but is almost certain to. Many updates are done so in order to resolve bugs, so you are actually running code known to be broken in most cases. We look at system logs, of which you have 11 pages of in 30 days. Usually that would be expected to be empty. 



	We then have cloudflare in the mix. This, in addition to setup issues server side and 3rd party code issues, is one of our highest causes of issues on self hosted platforms. Its only sensible to ask that this is switched off.



	The above being said, at no point have we stated we will not look into your issue, and at no point have we stated the issue 'is 3rd party'. What we actually asked is that these things are checked first, before we continue with our investigation. There has been no further response on the ticket since that point.



	To use your own analogy there. It's like you visit a doctor for a headache, the receptionist seeing you have blood running down your head one side, a hole in the other side, you have a hat which looks to be too tight and crushing your skull, and the nurse saying ""Before we continue, we need to check the obvious. We need to remove that hat, patch that hole, and check to see where the bleeding is coming from"". Unfortunately, that nurse is not going to send you to the doctor before performing her preliminary assessments and checks.



	We're certainly not here to work against you Guarav, and again, I'm personally sorry to hear you believe we are. It's very much in our interest to ensure your issues is resolved as quickly as possible.Should add to this, please let us know if you have found a bug within the software, then we can ensure we get it resolvedLike always Marc, you still miss the point.On 4/28/2022 at 11:08 AM,   Gauravk said:

	Hey @Gauravk. I am sorry you aren't having the best experience. 😔

	By the way Gauravk, when I have issues usually if you disable all the plugins and anything that is added by a third party to see if the issue resolves. If it does resolve, it is probably one of the third party items I have added. All you do is turn each one on one at a time and see if the issue returns until you figure out which one is the culprit. If you turn all the third party items off and the issue is not resolved then at the very least you can explain to IC support the issue is not resolved when you turn all third party items off.

Pirated software at a company? [closed],"I would first approach the ""powers that be"" regarding this practice.  If they refuse to listen, take it to the BSA or whoever handles this in your area.

A company that sells a product expects to be paid for that product.  I'm sure if the shoe were on the other foot (i.e. the company's product was being pirated) they would pursue it.  It is idiocy to think you can sell product but cheat others out of theirs.What they use is not your business, for as long as this does not affect you. If your personal working place is 100% legal, they do not ask you to use pirated software, pay you the salary, just work and don't think too much.

If they ask you to use pirated software, you have two options, either agree and be complicit or to reject. If in the latter case you get fired, then you can pursue legal ways to request compensation for lost time, income and other damages.

You got out of there and did the right thing. Enjoy the life.

ADDED: The question of morality of turning the company over is not that easy. The moral varies from culture to culture. In some countries (mostly of western civilization) communicating every act of lawbreaking (even within family/parents/children) to authorities is a normal practice. In other countries this could be considered a highly amoral action with the actor losing his face/respect of others and under circumstances even risking getting revenge (seriously consider it if your action will ultimately ruin their business). I'd personally would consider a neutral position. If they don't ask you personally to use pirated software and they are good to you, respond in kind. If they ask you to use it, you decline and they throw you out, then you can approach them and ask for compensation for the complete period until you find another place. If they don't take seriously, then you can consider whether it is worth the trouble (say, you relocated to another town, rented an appartment and now you're out) or not (you just take one of the other job offers you hopefully had). In any case, the decision is yours.I would only tattle if they pushed first i.e. they forced me to use their pirated software or face disciplinary action. I personally don't have a problem with software piracy, it's a fact of life in the industry we work in. But for a company to force you to use software they obtained illegally in this day in age, when there are so many viable open source alternatives, is a little bit much.

If they just said, ""here, use this illegally downloaded software if you'd like to,"" and let me use other software if I felt like it, I would just move on and forget about them.I've been faced with this sort of thing, and my solution has always been to go over my management's head asking an ""innocent"" question, to make sure it's known all the way to the top.

When asked to take part in a scheme to defraud a vendor, I emailed the company's lawyers asking whether they felt I could be held criminally responsible, and if so, whether they would pay for my defense.

Of course by doing this you're asking to be fired. In this case, it was a large enough company (publically traded with a multi-billion dollar market cap) and I had enough political capital built up that it caused them to correct their behavior and increase my bonus. But I was not counting on this.

If it's already known all the way to the top, you have to decide whether you consider it more unethical to pirate software or be a rat. In cases I've dealt with this sort of thing, I was just making sure that the policy was known to upper management. Also in the case where I emailed the company's lawyers, I was asked to be an active participant and had been complaining about the situation for a full year. I was not simply asked to look the other way.My opinion is to report it.  At a corporate level, if they want to use the software and not in an evaluation situation, they should pay for it, plain and simple.  The BSA has a good anonymous reporting scheme, and you could get a reward.This is a simple answer.  The company is doing something other than what is in the nature of my character an beliefs.  I have only achieved in this life through being truthful and honest in my dealings.

I'm leaving the company.If it was an out-of-the-ordinary thing, I'd let it go; however, your case is more systemic.  The fact that the company required the use of certain software is the most telling bit.

I'd give that corporation a warning, and if they fail to heed that warning, then turn them in to the BSA.Using Free Software instead was definitely the right way to go. In my opinion one of the main things holding Free Software back from wider acceptance among the public at large is the general public's lack of respect for software licenses. If everybody suddenly started obeying the letter of their software licenses and the law, Microsoft's installed user base would probably be cut in half overnight.

As for being forced to use unlicensed software, that's a toughie. It is important that you make sure everyone understands that what they are asking you to do is illegal, and that you know they are asking you to break the law (or help them break it). If they still insist at that point, of course the Right Thing would be to quit on the spot. Folks with kids to feed and mortgages to pay often feel they have to do less drastic things. But we all like to think we'd do The Right Thing.I'm not sure I would handle ""reporting"" them to the BSA, because of cultural issues and because the BSA, like the RIAA, is doing evil under a legitimate cause.

That being said, as a software developer I am perhaps more altruistic (or naive) and I am feeling more sensitive to software companies getting paid. More software piracy means less jobs and lower pay for a lot of us and indirectly myself. I feel that most business software that is used by software companies is fairly priced, and that large companies like MS have recently been more sensitive to the needs of small shops rather than huge enterprises in their licensing and pricing schemes. Licensing most typical software should cost a small fragments of what the employees cost. 

In addition, there are sufficient acceptable alternatives if one prefers not to use major products. If I ran a company doing .NET development, I'd expect to pay for .NET. 

There are also cheaper alternatives. I would argue that most PDFS that the average dev needs to generate can be created without adobe, there are cheaper alternatives. So maybe the solution is limiting the amount of available software and paying for it.I'll take a middle of the road approach:  Does it represent a lost sale?  I have a hard time being bothered by piracy that doesn't represent lost sales.

Thus if the company is in the red would any good be done by driving them farther into the red, likely out of business?  However, if they are decently in the black the case for reporting it grows much stronger.

Since this is apparently a government agency it's not going to be forced out of business by paying for it's software and furthermore I think the government should be held to a higher standard.  Report it.

Edit:  I'm NOT saying it's right, I'm saying that if there is no lost sale I don't see it as that big a wrong.I can't identify where I work, other than ""it's a government agency"". 

It flabergasts me that many (?maybe most?) people in our IT department use some piece of software illegally every day... everything from text editors to RDBMS's.

While much of the software I use at home is ""of questionable lineage"", none of the software I use at work is even remotely ""grey"". 

If I am using your product(s) to earn my living then it is asbsolutely my responsability to ensure that you recieve a fair share of the fruits of our combined labours. I couldn't DO my job without tools, good tools. I pay for my tools, and I pay more for good tools, just like a carpenter. 

There are good reasons why a DeWalt drill costs ten times as much as ""the equivalent"" Back&Decker. The DeWalt works, reliably!, which is worth money to me, and my customers. 

Would you condone a carpenter ""stealing"" a drill from ToolCity? Why or why not? 

Would you condone a programmer ""stealing"" a compiler from Borland? Why or why not?

Would you condone a starving peasant ""stealing"" deer from the Kings Park? Why or why not?

What are the differences?

What do you think would happen to drill manufacturers if most people thought it was ""fair enough"" to steal drills? Who would go broke first? DeWalt or Back & Decker?

Cheers. Keith.As long as the company is not doing anything that endangers you, endangers others, or places you at legal risk (and using the software provided by the company no matter how ill-gotten does not place you personally at risk) I think it is fair of the company to make the request and it would be underhanded and slimey to turn them in. Sorry, but we can say anything moral and ethical we want all we want, but at the end of the day its just like your mother told you as a child -- no one likes a tattle-tale. 

Now, if your company requests you to use illegal software, and you have voiced your objections, and you feel strongly about those objections, and the company has chosen to ignore them, then you also should consider leaving the company -- not because of the software but because your company obviously has no respect for you.",,,,,1,1696,40.8,39.37,46.87,23.97,20.68,19.22,91.92,74.29,59.55,16.1,9.96,3.66,0.53,3.3,0.06,2.3,6.13,15.51,7.61,0.53,12.68,10.14,4.25,7.61,1.83,19.16,7.19,4.95,4.48,0.77,1,2.71,17.33,0.94,16.39,2.54,2.77,2.59,3.83,0.65,6.01,0.06,3.24,1.77,1.47,0.71,0.59,0.12,0,0.12,0,0,12.85,4.07,0.35,0.29,0.35,0.83,1.95,7.55,0.18,0,0.12,0.12,2.18,0.24,0,1.95,6.43,0.06,0.12,4.25,2.59,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.47,0.24,1,0.24,0.41,0,0.29,0.41,0.06,5.48,7.96,0.77,1.3,5.19,0.41,0.06,0.53,1.65,3.24,5.54,0.88,0.06,0,0.06,0,0,16.63,5.19,4.25,0.83,0.06,2.3,4.01,

	You are very right. But it is also true that you are lagging behind. Unfortunately.🙂I'll report any errors I see, but so far I've been running it on a fairly busy, large forum for at least two months...long enough for Google to notice anyway 😁, and so far the main thing I've noticed is improved performance.


	Any estimate on when the update will come out that fully supports 8.1?



			
				


	Edited May 25 by sadams101Also note that once IPS announces support for 8.1 anyone using third-party apps will have to be assured each and every app is fully 8.1 compliant.  There will likely be a lag between official IPS support and every app getting updated (if needed).  There are lots of great new features in 8.1 that some developers may want to take advantage of to take their apps to the next level.  This upcoming PHP version will likely be a bumpy ride, but hopefully worth it in the long term.I run over 25 apps and plugins, most are custom, and I did have to upgrade around 1/3 of them when I upgraded to PHP 8.0, but every single one of them seems to work fine with 8.1, so it seems to me the big leap was going from PHP 7.4 to 8.0, and the jump to 8.1 was not as big of a deal,

Please clear test install URL,"Hi Invision Support



	I accidentally began a local installation at http://192.168.1.16/ips_6b004/ which was the default option on the installation screen instead of localhost. When I realised that it was going into the ips_6b004 folder, I removed that part from the URL, but hadn't noticed that it wasn't localhost and I then got the test URL license error message. Note that this is after I'd already clicked next to start the installation, which is likely what locked it. However, I'd used a bad MySQL password, so the installation never actually proceeded. Now, when I try to change it in the client area by clicking Change Licensed URL, I see the error below, so can't change it. I'd be grateful if you could please blank it out for me.

	Hi again, I tried to do all of those things you've mentioned but still not working, probably I'm doing something wrong ?  

	As @dndarknight said, only after you install a plugin from marketplace or even a custom one, the managing blocks would not work anymore. But if there are no plugins, than everything works perfectly.

	This would likely indicate that there is something wrong with the plugin (or plugins) which you have installed. I'm afraid, you would need to disable and try each one independently till you find the culprit.I have the same problem, but I have removed all plugins and restoring to the default theme doesn't change nothing.Bump

	Okay my bad. I will tell him to recreate a new topic / reply in here. 

	Sorry.No problem. 🙂 As mentioned, there is no problem you requesting support for someone if that needs to happen.

The system is Windows Server 2008R2. What am I doing wrong?If you're using Windows Server 2008 R2 then there is an x64 and x86 version of PowerShell both of which have to have their execution policies set. Did you set the execution policy on both hosts?
As an Administrator, you can set the execution policy by typing this into your PowerShell window:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

For more information, see Using the Set-ExecutionPolicy Cmdlet.
When you are done, you can set the policy back to its default value with:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted

You may see an error:
Access to the registry key
'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell' is denied. 
To change the execution policy for the default (LocalMachine) scope, 
  start Windows PowerShell with the ""Run as administrator"" option. 
To change the execution policy for the current user, 
  run ""Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser"".

So you may need to run the command like this (as seen in comments):
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUserYou can bypass this policy for a single file by adding -ExecutionPolicy Bypass when running PowerShell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script.ps1I had a similar issue and noted that the default cmd on Windows Server 2012, was running the x64 one.
For Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012, run the following commands as Administrator:
x86 (32 bit)

Open C:\Windows\SysWOW64\cmd.exe

Run the command powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
x64 (64 bit)

Open C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe

Run the command powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
You can check mode using

In CMD: echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%
In Powershell: [Environment]::Is64BitProcess

MSDN - Windows PowerShell execution policies

Windows - 32bit vs 64bit directory explanationMost of the existing answers explain the How, but very few explain the Why. And before you go around executing code from strangers on the Internet, especially code that disables security measures, you should understand exactly what you're doing. So here's a little more detail on this problem.

From the TechNet About Execution Policies Page:


  Windows PowerShell execution policies let you determine the conditions under which Windows PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts.


The benefits of which, as enumerated by PowerShell Basics - Execution Policy and Code Signing, are:


  
  Control of Execution - Control the level of trust for executing scripts.
  Command Highjack - Prevent injection of commands in my path.
  Identity - Is the script created and signed by a developer I trust and/or a signed with a certificate from a Certificate Authority I trust.
  Integrity - Scripts cannot be modified by malware or malicious user.
  


To check your current execution policy, you can run Get-ExecutionPolicy. But you're probably here because you want to change it.

To do so you'll run the Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet.

You'll have two major decisions to make when updating the execution policy.

Execution Policy Type:


Restricted† - No Script either local, remote or downloaded can be executed on the system.
AllSigned - All script that are ran require to be digitally signed.
RemoteSigned - All remote scripts (UNC) or downloaded need to be signed.
Unrestricted - No signature for any type of script is required.


Scope of new Change


LocalMachine† - The execution policy affects all users of the computer.
CurrentUser - The execution policy affects only the current user.
Process - The execution policy affects only the current Windows PowerShell process.


† = Default

For example: if you wanted to change the policy to RemoteSigned for just the CurrentUser, you'd run the following command:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser


Note: In order to change the Execution policy, you must be running PowerShell As Adminstrator.
If you are in regular mode and try to change the execution policy, you'll get the following error:


  Access to the registry key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell' is denied. To change the execution policy for the default (LocalMachine) scope, start Windows PowerShell with the ""Run as administrator"" option.


If you want to tighten up the internal restrictions on your own scripts that have not been downloaded from the Internet (or at least don't contain the UNC metadata), you can force the policy to only run signed sripts.  To sign your own scripts, you can follow the instructions on Scott Hanselman's article on Signing PowerShell Scripts.

Note: Most people are likely to get this error whenever they open Powershell because the first thing PS tries to do when it launches is execute your user profile script that sets up your environment however you like it.  

The file is typically located in:

%UserProfile%\My Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile.ps1


You can find the exact location by running the powershell variable

$profile


If there's nothing that you care about in the profile, and don't want to fuss with your security settings, you can just delete it and powershell won't find anything that it cannot execute.We can get the status of current ExecutionPolicy by the command below:
Get-ExecutionPolicy

By default it is Restricted. To allow the execution of PowerShell scripts we need to set this ExecutionPolicy either as Unrestricted or Bypass.
We can set the policy for Current User as Bypass by using any of the below PowerShell commands:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force

Unrestricted policy loads all configuration files and runs all scripts. If you run an unsigned script that was downloaded from the Internet, you are prompted for permission before it runs.
Whereas in Bypass policy, nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts during script execution. Bypass ExecutionPolicy is more relaxed than Unrestricted.Also running this command before the script also solves the issue:
Set-ExecutionPolicy UnrestrictedIn Windows 7:

Go to Start Menu and search for ""Windows PowerShell ISE"".

Right click the x86 version and choose ""Run as administrator"".

In the top part, paste Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned; run the script. Choose ""Yes"".

Repeat these steps for the 64-bit version of Powershell ISE too (the non x86 version).

I'm just clarifying the steps that @Chad Miller hinted at.  Thanks Chad!If you are in an environment where you are not an administrator, you can set the Execution Policy just for you (CurrentUser), and it will not require administrator.
You can set it to RemoteSigned:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope ""CurrentUser"" -ExecutionPolicy ""RemoteSigned""

or Unrestricted:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope ""CurrentUser"" -ExecutionPolicy ""Unrestricted""

You can read all about Getting and Setting Execution policy in the help entries:
Help Get-ExecutionPolicy -Full
Help Set-ExecutionPolicy -FullRemoteSigned: all scripts you created yourself will be run, and all scripts downloaded from the Internet will need to be signed by a trusted publisher.

OK, change the policy by simply typing:

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSignedI'm using Windows 10 and was unable to run any command. The only command that gave me some clues was this: 

[x64]


  
  Open C:\Windows\SysWOW64\cmd.exe [as administrator]
  Run the command> powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
  


But this didn't work. It was limited. Probably new security policies for Windows10. I had this error: 


  Set-ExecutionPolicy: Windows PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, but the setting is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific scope. Due to the override, your shell will retain its current effective execution policy of...


So I found another way (solution):


Open Run Command/Console (Win + R) 
Type: gpedit.msc (Group Policy Editor)
Browse to Local Computer Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Powershell. 
Enable ""Turn on Script Execution""
Set the policy as needed. I set mine to ""Allow all scripts"".


Now open PowerShell and enjoy ;)Open Windows PowerShell Command and run below query to change ExecutionPolicy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
if it ask for confirm changes press 'Y' and hit enter.sou should run this command
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy UnrestrictedWin + R and type copy paste command and press OK:

powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope ""CurrentUser"" -ExecutionPolicy ""RemoteSigned""


And execute your script.

Then revert changes like:

powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope ""CurrentUser"" -ExecutionPolicy ""AllSigned""Open command prompt in windows,
If the problem is only with powershell use the following command,
powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope ""CurrentUser"" -ExecutionPolicy ""RemoteSigned""Setting the execution policy is environment-specific. If you are trying to execute a script from the running x86 ISE you have to use the x86 PowerShell to set the execution policy. Likewise, if you are running the 64-bit ISE you have to set the policy with the 64-bit PowerShell.you may try this and select ""All"" Option

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSignedOpen Run Command/Console ( Win + R )
Type: gpedit. msc (Group Policy Editor)
Browse to Local Computer Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Powershell.
Enable ""Turn on Script Execution""
Set the policy as needed. I set mine to ""Allow all scripts"".


Now run the run command what ever you are using.. Trust this the app will runs.. Enjoy :)You can also bypass this by using the following command:

PS > powershell Get-Content .\test.ps1 | Invoke-Expression


You can also read this article by Scott Sutherland that explains 15 different ways to bypass the PowerShell Set-ExecutionPolicy if you don't have administrator privileges:

15 Ways to Bypass the PowerShell Execution PolicyI have also faced similar issue try this hope it helps someone
As I'm using windows so followed the steps as given below
Open command prompt as an administrator and then go to this path
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\npm\

Look for the file ng.ps1 in this folder (dir)
and then delete it (del ng.ps1)
You can also clear npm cache after this though it should work without this step as well.
Hope it helps as it worked for me.
Hope it helpsFirst, you have to need to open the powershell and run this command.
set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Then it will ask yo to confirm. Type Y and press Enter.
When you run this command, you can see that your system has set all policies for the current user as remotely. It will take few seconds to complete this process.
The image will be shown like below:

To check if execution policy has set, Type :
Get-ExecutionPolicy
If its set output would be like this:In the PowerShell ISE editor I found running the following line first allowed scripts.

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope ProcessSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Executing this command in administrator mode in powershell will solve the problem.In Window 10:
if you are not administrator, you can use this
powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser

cmdlet Set-ExecutionPolicy at command pipeline position 1
Supply values for the following parameters:
ExecutionPolicy: RemoteSigned
it solved my problem like a charm!if you have git installed, just use git bash.For Windows 11.....
It is indeed very easy. Just open settings app
Navigate to Privacy and Security
Click on For Developers and scroll to bottom and find PowerShell option under which check the checkbox stating ""Change the execution policy ...... remote scripts"".Open PowerShell as Administrator and run Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
Provide RemoteSigned and press Enter
Run Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
Provide Unrestricted and press EnterIn windows 10, enable the option under the name: 'Install apps from any source, including loose files.'

It fixed the issue for me.Open PowerShell as a administrator. Run the following command
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Type Y when asked!In PowerShell 2.0, the execution policy was set to disabled by default.

From then on, the PowerShell team has made a lot of improvements, and they are confident that users will not break things much while running scripts. So from PowerShell 4.0 onward, it is enabled by default.

In your case, type Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned from the PowerShell console and say yes.I get another warning when I tryit to run Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

I solved with this commands

Set-ExecutionPolicy ""RemoteSigned"" -Scope Process -Confirm:$false

Set-ExecutionPolicy ""RemoteSigned"" -Scope CurrentUser -Confirm:$false",,,,,1,2073,74.06,51.56,18.92,24.54,23.83,30.49,72.31,51.13,41,8.88,4.73,1.21,0.14,3.23,0,0.14,4.15,11.77,6.56,3.09,10.85,6.37,3.04,6.27,0.92,13.31,3.76,2.17,8.73,0.68,1.35,6.71,11.87,1.06,10.81,1.5,2.7,2.36,2.27,0.24,3.28,0,2.17,1.25,0.92,0.92,0.43,0.48,0,0.05,0.1,0,7.67,3.76,0.43,0.1,0.05,0.05,0.77,3.96,0,0,0,0.05,1.06,0,0,1.06,7.57,0.05,1.74,5.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.87,0.34,0.34,0.1,0.1,0,0.19,0.39,0.29,4,7.77,0.53,2.99,3.96,0.39,0.05,0.05,2.7,1.59,4.49,1.4,0.96,0.77,0.19,0,0,27.69,6.71,2.56,0.1,0.14,1.25,16.93,

Problem with displaying windows / closing menus,"Hey,



	I started having very strange problems with the system, happening all over the site including the admin panel



	For example



	When I click on the Contact Us button in the forum, the window opens properly, but when I want to close it by clicking on the X button, it simply does not respond - the solution is just to refresh the page



	In addition, in the admin panel, when I enter the forums menu and want to see all the forums in the category, it shows me the window like this 



	



	Another problem in the admin panel is when I click on System menu > Advanced Configuration and then wants to enter one of the tabs, he thinks and moves around non-stop (when I click open in a new window on one of the tabs, it opens normally) - this happens in part of the admin panel and not in all of it



	



	The server ran a version of PHP 8.1



	This is a clean and new installation of the forum system a few days ago



	The problem started a day or two ago



	 



	what can be done ?In the first instance, please check if this is cache (which it very much looks like it may be). Go to support in the top right of your admin CP, and select ""Clear cache"". Once you have done that, check things over again.



	
		If you are then still having issues and have addressed anything showing in that area, we would need to look further into this for you, however the access details on file appear to be incorrect or missing. Could you please update these details by visiting your client area, selecting the relevant purchase, then clicking ""Review/Update Access Information"" under the ""Stored Access Information"" section.I tried to clean cache but it's doesn't help , unfortunately the problem still exists....



	I updated the login information



	Thanks for the help !Looks like an update is in progress. Please let us know once it is done.It's normal that the update takes over an hour already?



	It's an update that the system suggested to install to fix the calendar even though I'm on php version 8.1

	Don't know if it will really help... There are a lot of problems all over the systemIs there any caching on your community? I am seeing that the upgrade is complete but the front-end is still displaying it. If there is no caching on your server, we will need investigate your database.No, there is no caching enabled on the server (at least not that I enabled)



	He has been updating for over two hours what can be done?On 8/17/2022 at 3:23 PM,   The DeaDly said:

	If you're stuck there and have not started the upgrader yet in /admin/upgrade, you'll want to download a full set of files from the Client Area and extract those to your computer. Then upload the contents of the ""ips_****"" folder to your server, overwriting what is there. Once that is done, go to /admin/upgrade and follow the prompts in your browser to complete the upgrade.I uploaded the files, the site is now working again

	When I enter admin/upgrade it shows that there is no update to install



	All the problems I listed in the first message still exist unfortunately....A video of some of the problems
	  Screen_Recording_20220818-092922_Samsung Internet.mp4Fetching info...Is this only happening on your custom language pack?



	If not, please check on a default unaltered language pack. If you are then still seeing issues, update your access details on file so we can take a look for youNo, this also happens in the english pack.....



	I just installed yesterday my custom language pack....the problems started even before that...



	 



	I updated my access details yesterday too .... it doesn't work? what details are incorrect / missing?Your system uses email to login, and display name was providedI changed it to login by using a username and updated the details againPlease check your server for mod_security and securi. One of these it looks like is blocking requests and causing your issuesI turned off ModSecurity on the server



	no change in the problems...I just remembered that a few days ago the server support installed the SSL certificate for my website

	Because there were some problems he forced the following rule on her

			RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off

			RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

	 in the file htaccess



	Is it related?That is very likely related, yes.



	The software controls the use of http versus https, and server-level redirects interferes with that.



	Remove or comment out those 3 lines.



	Then in your conf_global.php file, make sure the board URL is using https:// and not http://.



	Then login to your ACP, go to the Support page, and click the button to clear the system cache.

Profile cover photo,"I've got an issue with cover photos not displaying, after upload the area is showing as grey.

	I notice from an inspection the following value 


.ipsCoverPhoto_photo {
  opacity: 0.0001;

	If I open the image in another tab I can see it normally

	There are no options to reposition the image only remove or upload



	If I open the block editor, the image shows up, if I upload one, I can see the repositioning, and it saves. If I close the block editor the cover image shows but without any repositioning 

	If I refresh the page the image disappears again.


	I've run support, cleared caches, rebuilt a theme from scratch, and disabled all my plugins.



	I'm currently displaying them by adding the following in the css, but again there is no way to reposition the image.

"Profile links in ""Similar content""","In our community guests don't get a link to profiles of users in threads. It's set by permissions in ""Apps"" > System > Profile.



	But in block ""Similar content"" these links to user profiles are active for guests. They end with a 403 error. It's possible to change this behaviour?You have removed permission via modules for these. You can add them by changing access in the System>Profiles module. If you are unsure how to do this, check out the module section in the following guideThanks for your answer. But I can‘t find a Solution in this guide.



	I have removed permissions via modules, yes. Now guests don‘t get active links to user profiles. That‘s the intended behaviour.



	But in „Similar content“ block, there are the links to user profiles still active. How can I achieve that there links to user profiles also aren‘t active?Pretty sure this is a (IPS) caching issue. I’ve seen this for other block types too.  

	The code in the template is okay. It will actually remove the profile links for guests, when guests are not allowed to see profiles. But the problem is: If the cached version is generated after a member(!) saw the block, then guests will also see that same cached HTML code including those links. And once the block cache time is up, the next version of the block may or may not have those links. You never know.On 8/31/2022 at 3:00 AM,   opentype said:

	should 'similar content' blocks be cached as this would mean that forum post titles will be showing to members without permissions to view as well as the above



	such blocks has to be non-cached yes?

Programmatically Uninstall a Software using C#,"I want to uninstall a software by using my code, I have already tried wmic approach to perform uninstallation but it can't able to find my Software in the system. Is it possible to uninstall without using msi file or any setup file. I found this code but it doesn't work---The most reliable way would be to programmatically execute the following shell command:

msiexec.exe /x {PRODUCT-GUID}


If you made the original MSI you will have access to your PRODUCT-GUID, and that is all you need. No need for the actual MSI file as Windows stashes a copy of this away for exactly this purpose.

Setting Public Properties
    [PROPERTY=PropertyValue]try this

We get a ManagementObject property by using the following format:

The full block of code to list installed applications:

using System.Management
private List<string> ListPrograms()
{
    List<string> programs = new List<string>();

    try
    {
        ManagementObjectSearcher mos = 
          new ManagementObjectSearcher(""SELECT * FROM Win32_Product"");
        foreach (ManagementObject mo in mos.Get())
        {
            try
            {
                //more properties:
                //http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa394378(v=vs.85).aspx
                programs.Add(mo[""Name""].ToString());

            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                //this program may not have a name property
            }
        }

        return programs;

    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        return programs;
    }
}


Now that we have a list of installed applications we should be able to pass the [Name] property to our uninstall method.


  we now need to Invoke the Win32_Product method to “Uninstall”


Here is the entire block to uninstall an application, I'll get in detail after you take a look.

  private bool UninstallProgram(string ProgramName)
    {
        try
        {
            ManagementObjectSearcher mos = new ManagementObjectSearcher(
              ""SELECT * FROM Win32_Product WHERE Name = '"" + ProgramName + ""'"");
            foreach (ManagementObject mo in mos.Get())
            {
                try
                {
                    if (mo[""Name""].ToString() == ProgramName)
                    {
                        object hr = mo.InvokeMethod(""Uninstall"", null);
                        return (bool)hr;
                    }
                }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    //this program may not have a name property, so an exception will be thrown
                }
            }

            //was not found...
            return false;

        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }It's an old question and maybe too late to answer but here is my code anyway

Programming Modular software,"I stand in front of a little problem; I want to create a modular software. Let's make it more general and not specific for my case. What I want to create is a software which loads dlls and those dlls adds features to the software. Think of the dlls as xvid, divx or whatever additional codec, feature to your favorite video-player. I want a more custom modular program though, in my case I'm creating a software to handle Customers, Invoices and Products and different users might have different needs and therefore I need to handle this somehow! However, re-compiling the software and specificly sending the new files to each different user is ""stupid"" I would rather create a modular software ( don't actually know if this is the correct term ). So what I was thinking is that I begin creating a pattern of which my DLL's should follow. Then I create a Module handler in my software which loads the actuall DLL and calls the method in it ( here's where the pattern come in! ). What I'd like to know is; Am I on the right track? Might you guys give me some pointers or examples on this matter? This is all in C#, but would of course be interesting to see how it would differ in Java, Python or C++ too.create a common interface IMyInterface for your classes which should include everything that is common between all of your Moduals.  You should look into the Managed Extensibility Framework I believe you can get it from Codeplex.You have to have a purpose.  You either need the module to conform to some kind of interface or something the app can handle (like a method with a known attribute that you find via reflection).  The interface then performs known functionality like invoice creation, invoice printing, etc.

Alternatively your app has to conform to some interface and uses hooks for the module to use to inject itself into your app.

Plugins would be good for something that can be easily sliced up (media codecs).  Hooks would be good for something with a well-defined event model (like a web server).  Which you use depends on how you want your modularity for customers, invoices, etc. to work.Here is a similar SO thread.  Here's a list of dependency injection frameworks, Microsoft's is Unity.

Proper MIME media type for PDF files,"When working with PDFs, I've run across the MIME types application/pdf and application/x-pdf among others. Is there a difference between these two types, and if so what is it? Is one preferred over the other? I'm working on a web app which must deliver huge amounts of PDFs and I want to do it the correct way, if there is one.The standard Media Type (formerly known as MIME types) is application/pdf. The assignment is defined in RFC 3778, The application/pdf Media Type, referenced from the Media Types registry.
Media Types are controlled by a standards body, The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This is the same organization that manages the root name servers and the IP address space.
The use of x-pdf predates the standardization of the Media Type for PDF. Media Types in the x- namespace are considered experimental, just as those in the vnd. namespace are considered vendor-specific. x-pdf might be used for compatibility with old software.This is a convention defined in RFC 2045 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies.


Private [subtype] values (starting with ""X-"") may be defined
bilaterally between two cooperating agents without
outside registration or standardization. Such values
cannot be registered or standardized.

New standard values should be registered with IANA as described in RFC 2048.



A similar restriction applies to the top-level type. From the same source,

If another top-level type is to be used for any reason, it must be
given a name starting with ""X-"" to indicate its non-standard status
and to avoid a potential conflict with a future official name.

(Note that per RFC 2045, ""[m]atching of media type and subtype is ALWAYS case-insensitive"", so there's no difference between the interpretation of 'X-' and 'x-'.)
So it's fair to guess that ""application/x-foo"" was used before the IANA defined ""application/foo"". And it still might be used by folks who aren't aware of the IANA token assignment.
As Chris Hanson said MIME types are controlled by the IANA. This is detailed in RFC 2048 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures. According to RFC 3778, which is cited by the IANA as the definition for ""application/pdf"",

The application/pdf media type was first registered in 1993 by Paul Lindner for use by the gopher protocol; the registration was subsequently updated in 1994 by Steve Zilles.

The type ""application/pdf"" has been around for well over a decade. So it seems to me that wherever ""application/x-pdf"" has been used in new apps, the decision may not have been deliberate.From Wikipedia Media type,

A media type is composed of a type, a subtype, and optional
parameters. As an example, an HTML file might be designated text/html; charset=UTF-8.
Media type consists of top-level type name and sub-type name, which is
further structured into so-called ""trees"".

top-level type name / subtype name [ ; parameters ]

top-level type name / [ tree. ] subtype name [ +suffix ] [ ; parameters ]

All media types should be registered using the IANA registration procedures. Currently the following trees are created: standard, vendor, personal or vanity, unregistered x.
Standard:

Media types in the standards tree do not use any tree facet (prefix).

type / media type name [+suffix]

Examples: ""application/xhtml+xml"", ""image/png""
Vendor:

Vendor tree is used for media types associated with publicly available
products. It uses vnd. facet.

type / vnd. media type name [+suffix] - used in the case of well-known producer

type / vnd. producer's name followed by media type name [+suffix] - producer's name must be approved by IANA

type / vnd. producer's name followed by product's name [+suffix] - producer's name must be approved by IANA

Personal or Vanity tree:

Personal or Vanity tree includes media types created experimentally or
as part of products that are not distributed commercially. It uses
prs. facet.

type / prs. media type name [+suffix]

Unregistered x. tree:

The ""x."" tree may be used for media types intended exclusively for use
in private, local environments and only with the active agreement of
the parties exchanging them. Types in this tree cannot be registered.
According to the previous version of RFC 6838 - obsoleted RFC 2048
(published in November 1996) it should rarely, if ever, be necessary
to use unregistered experimental types, and as such use of both ""x-""
and ""x."" forms is discouraged. Previous versions of that RFC - RFC
1590 and RFC 1521 stated that the use of ""x-"" notation for the
sub-type name may be used for unregistered and private sub-types, but
this recommendation was obsoleted in November 1996.

type / x. media type name [+suffix]

So its clear that the standard type MIME type application/pdf is the appropriate one to use while you should avoid using the obsolete and unregistered x- media type as stated in RFC 2048 and RFC 6838.",,,,,1,797,82.68,28.34,15.04,25.06,16.27,24.47,69.76,52.45,41.66,4.89,0.88,0.5,0,0.13,0,0.13,4.02,11.29,7.03,3.14,12.42,9.03,3.01,5.77,0.88,14.18,4.77,2.51,1.76,0.25,0.5,1,13.55,0.5,13.05,1.88,3.64,1.88,2.89,0.75,4.52,0,1.38,0.88,0.5,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,0.13,0,6.02,2.38,0.13,0,0.25,0.38,1.13,3.64,0.13,0,0,0,1.25,0,0,1.25,5.02,0.13,0,4.89,0.13,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0.13,0.13,0,0,0,0,0.25,0.25,2.89,5.14,0.25,0.13,4.64,0.13,0,0,2.63,4.14,4.64,1.13,0,0,0,0,0,30.24,6.27,3.51,0.25,0,1.76,18.44,
Proper use of the IDisposable interface,"I know from reading Microsoft documentation that the ""primary"" use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources. To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the Dispose() method is implemented to free managed resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you. For example: My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would? Edit:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?IDisposable is often used to exploit the using statement and take advantage of an easy way to do deterministic cleanup of managed objects.

public class LoggingContext : IDisposable {
    public Finicky(string name) {
        Log.Write(""Entering Log Context {0}"", name);
        Log.Indent();
    }
    public void Dispose() {
        Log.Outdent();
    }

    public static void Main() {
        Log.Write(""Some initial stuff."");
        try {
            using(new LoggingContext()) {
                Log.Write(""Some stuff inside the context."");
                throw new Exception();
            }
        } catch {
            Log.Write(""Man, that was a heavy exception caught from inside a child logging context!"");
        } finally {
            Log.Write(""Some final stuff."");
        }
    }
}The purpose of the Dispose pattern is to provide a mechanism to clean up both managed and unmanaged resources and when that occurs depends on how the Dispose method is being called. In your example, the use of Dispose is not actually doing anything related to dispose, since clearing a list has no impact on that collection being disposed. Likewise, the calls to set the variables to null also have no impact on the GC.

You can take a look at this article for more details on how to implement the Dispose pattern, but it basically looks like this:

public class SimpleCleanup : IDisposable
{
    // some fields that require cleanup
    private SafeHandle handle;
    private bool disposed = false; // to detect redundant calls

    public SimpleCleanup()
    {
        this.handle = /*...*/;
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Dispose managed resources.
                if (handle != null)
                {
                    handle.Dispose();
                }
            }

            // Dispose unmanaged managed resources.

            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}


The method that is the most important here is the Dispose(bool), which actually runs under two different circumstances: 


disposing == true: the method has been called directly or indirectly by a user's code. Managed and unmanaged resources can be disposed.
disposing == false: the method has been called by the runtime from inside the finalizer, and you should not reference other objects. Only unmanaged resources can be disposed. 


The problem with simply letting the GC take care of doing the cleanup is that you have no real control over when the GC will run a collection cycle (you can call GC.Collect(), but you really shouldn't) so resources may stay around longer than needed. Remember, calling Dispose() doesn't actually cause a collection cycle or in any way cause the GC to collect/free the object; it simply provides the means to more deterministicly cleanup the resources used and tell the GC that this cleanup has already been performed.

The whole point of IDisposable and the dispose pattern isn't about immediately freeing memory. The only time a call to Dispose will actually even have a chance of immediately freeing memory is when it is handling the disposing == false scenario and manipulating unmanaged resources. For managed code, the memory won't actually be reclaimed until the GC runs a collection cycle, which you really have no control over (other than calling GC.Collect(), which I've already mentioned is not a good idea).

Your scenario isn't really valid since strings in .NET don't use any unamanged resources and don't implement IDisposable, there is no way to force them to be ""cleaned up.""There should be no further calls to an object's methods after Dispose has been called on it (although an object should tolerate further calls to Dispose). Therefore the example in the question is silly. If Dispose is called, then the object itself can be discarded. So the user should just discard all references to that whole object (set them to null) and all the related objects internal to it will automatically get cleaned up.

As for the general question about managed/unmanaged and the discussion in other answers, I think any answer to this question has to start with a definition of an unmanaged resource.

What it boils down to is that there is a function you can call to put the system into a state, and there's another function you can call to bring it back out of that state. Now, in the typical example, the first one might be a function that returns a file handle, and the second one might be a call to CloseHandle.

But - and this is the key - they could be any matching pair of functions. One builds up a state, the other tears it down. If the state has been built but not torn down yet, then an instance of the resource exists. You have to arrange for the teardown to happen at the right time - the resource is not managed by the CLR. The only automatically managed resource type is memory. There are two kinds: the GC, and the stack. Value types are managed by the stack (or by hitching a ride inside reference types), and reference types are managed by the GC.

These functions may cause state changes that can be freely interleaved, or may need to be perfectly nested. The state changes may be threadsafe, or they might not.

Look at the example in Justice's question. Changes to the Log file's indentation must be perfectly nested, or it all goes wrong. Also they are unlikely to be threadsafe.

It is possible to hitch a ride with the garbage collector to get your unmanaged resources cleaned up. But only if the state change functions are threadsafe and two states can have lifetimes that overlap in any way. So Justice's example of a resource must NOT have a finalizer! It just wouldn't help anyone.

For those kinds of resources, you can just implement IDisposable, without a finalizer. The finalizer is absolutely optional - it has to be. This is glossed over or not even mentioned in many books.

You then have to use the using statement to have any chance of ensuring that Dispose is called. This is essentially like hitching a ride with the stack (so as finalizer is to the GC, using is to the stack).

The missing part is that you have to manually write Dispose and make it call onto your fields and your base class. C++/CLI programmers don't have to do that. The compiler writes it for them in most cases.

There is an alternative, which I prefer for states that nest perfectly and are not threadsafe (apart from anything else, avoiding IDisposable spares you the problem of having an argument with someone who can't resist adding a finalizer to every class that implements IDisposable).

Instead of writing a class, you write a function. The function accepts a delegate to call back to:

public static void Indented(this Log log, Action action)
{
    log.Indent();
    try
    {
        action();
    }
    finally
    {
        log.Outdent();
    }
}


And then a simple example would be:

Log.Write(""Message at the top"");
Log.Indented(() =>
{
    Log.Write(""And this is indented"");

    Log.Indented(() =>
    {
        Log.Write(""This is even more indented"");
    });
});
Log.Write(""Back at the outermost level again"");


The lambda being passed in serves as a code block, so it's like you make your own control structure to serve the same purpose as using, except that you no longer have any danger of the caller abusing it. There's no way they can fail to clean up the resource.

This technique is less useful if the resource is the kind that may have overlapping lifetimes, because then you want to be able to build resource A, then resource B, then kill resource A and then later kill resource B. You can't do that if you've forced the user to perfectly nest like this. But then you need to use IDisposable (but still without a finalizer, unless you have implemented threadsafety, which isn't free).Scenarios I make use of IDisposable: clean up unmanaged resources, unsubscribe for events, close connections

The idiom I use for implementing IDisposable (not threadsafe):

class MyClass : IDisposable {
    // ...

    #region IDisposable Members and Helpers
    private bool disposed = false;

    public void Dispose() {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    private void Dispose(bool disposing) {
        if (!this.disposed) {
            if (disposing) {
                // cleanup code goes here
            }
            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    ~MyClass() {
        Dispose(false);
    }
    #endregion
}Yep, that code is completely redundant and unnecessary and it doesn't make the garbage collector do anything it wouldn't otherwise do (once an instance of MyCollection goes out of scope, that is.)  Especially the .Clear() calls.

Answer to your edit:  Sort of.  If I do this:

public void WasteMemory()
{
    var instance = new MyCollection(); // this one has no Dispose() method
    instance.FillItWithAMillionStrings();
}

// 1 million strings are in memory, but marked for reclamation by the GC


It's functionally identical to this for purposes of memory management:

public void WasteMemory()
{
    var instance = new MyCollection(); // this one has your Dispose()
    instance.FillItWithAMillionStrings();
    instance.Dispose();
}

// 1 million strings are in memory, but marked for reclamation by the GC


If you really really really need to free the memory this very instant, call GC.Collect().  There's no reason to do this here, though.  The memory will be freed when it's needed.If MyCollection is going to be garbage collected anyway, then you shouldn't need to dispose it.  Doing so will just churn the CPU more than necessary, and may even invalidate some pre-calculated analysis that the garbage collector has already performed.

I use IDisposable to do things like ensure threads are disposed correctly, along with unmanaged resources.

EDIT In response to Scott's comment:


  The only time the GC performance metrics are affected is when a call the [sic] GC.Collect() is made""


Conceptually, the GC maintains a view of the object reference graph, and all references to it from the stack frames of threads.  This heap can be quite large and span many pages of memory.  As an optimisation, the GC caches its analysis of pages that are unlikely to change very often to avoid rescanning the page unnecessarily.  The GC receives notification from the kernel when data in a page changes, so it knows that the page is dirty and requires a rescan.  If the collection is in Gen0 then it's likely that other things in the page are changing too, but this is less likely in Gen1 and Gen2.  Anecdotally, these hooks were not available in Mac OS X for the team who ported the GC to Mac in order to get the Silverlight plug-in working on that platform.

Another point against unnecessary disposal of resources: imagine a situation where a process is unloading.  Imagine also that the process has been running for some time. Chances are that many of that process's memory pages have been swapped to disk.  At the very least they're no longer in L1 or L2 cache.  In such a situation there is no point for an application that's unloading to swap all those data and code pages back into memory to 'release' resources that are going to be released by the operating system anyway when the process terminates.  This applies to managed and even certain unmanaged resources.  Only resources that keep non-background threads alive must be disposed, otherwise the process will remain alive.

Now, during normal execution there are ephemeral resources that must be cleaned up correctly (as @fezmonkey points out database connections, sockets, window handles) to avoid unmanaged memory leaks.  These are the kinds of things that have to be disposed.  If you create some class that owns a thread (and by owns I mean that it created it and therefore is responsible for ensuring it stops, at least by my coding style), then that class most likely must implement IDisposable and tear down the thread during Dispose.

The .NET framework uses the IDisposable interface as a signal, even warning, to developers that the this class must be disposed.  I can't think of any types in the framework that implement IDisposable (excluding explicit interface implementations) where disposal is optional.I won't repeat the usual stuff about Using or freeing un-managed resources, that has all been covered. But I would like to point out what seems a common misconception.

Given the following code


Public Class LargeStuff
  Implements IDisposable
  Private _Large as string()

  'Some strange code that means _Large now contains several million long strings.

  Public Sub Dispose() Implements IDisposable.Dispose
    _Large=Nothing
  End Sub


I realise that the Disposable implementation does not follow current guidelines, but hopefully you all get the idea.

Now, when Dispose is called, how much memory gets freed?



Answer: None.

Calling Dispose can release unmanaged resources, it CANNOT reclaim managed memory, only the GC can do that.  Thats not to say that the above isn't a good idea, following the above pattern is still a good idea in fact.  Once Dispose has been run, there is nothing stopping the GC re-claiming the memory that was being used by _Large, even though the instance of LargeStuff may still be in scope.  The strings in _Large may also be in gen 0 but the instance of LargeStuff might be gen 2, so again, memory would be re-claimed sooner.

There is no point in adding a finaliser to call the Dispose method shown above though.  That will just DELAY the re-claiming of memory to allow the finaliser to run.In the example you posted, it still doesn't ""free the memory now"". All memory is garbage collected, but it may allow the memory to be collected in an earlier generation. You'd have to run some tests to be sure.



The Framework Design Guidelines are guidelines, and not rules. They tell you what the interface is primarily for, when to use it, how to use it, and when not to use it.

I once read code that was a simple RollBack() on failure utilizing IDisposable. The MiniTx class below would check a flag on Dispose() and if the Commit call never happened it would then call Rollback on itself. It added a layer of indirection making the calling code a lot easier to understand and maintain. The result looked something like: 

using( MiniTx tx = new MiniTx() )
{
    // code that might not work.

    tx.Commit();
} 


I've also seen timing / logging code do the same thing. In this case the Dispose() method stopped the timer and logged that the block had exited. 

using( LogTimer log = new LogTimer(""MyCategory"", ""Some message"") )
{
    // code to time...
}


So here are a couple of concrete examples that don't do any unmanaged resource cleanup, but do successfully used IDisposable to create cleaner code.If you want to delete right now, use unmanaged memory.

See:


Marshal.AllocHGlobal
Marshal.FreeHGlobal
Marshal.DestroyStructureIf anything, I'd expect the code to be less efficient than when leaving it out.

Calling the Clear() methods are unnecessary, and the GC probably wouldn't do that if the Dispose didn't do it...Apart from its primary use as a way to control the lifetime of system resources (completely covered by the awesome answer of Ian, kudos!), the IDisposable/using combo can also be used to scope the state change of (critical) global resources: the console, the threads, the process, any global object like an application instance.

I've written an article about this pattern: http://pragmateek.com/c-scope-your-global-state-changes-with-idisposable-and-the-using-statement/

It illustrates how you can protect some often used global state in a reusable and readable manner: console colors, current thread culture, Excel application object properties...I see a lot of answers have shifted to talk about using IDisposable for both managed and unmanaged resources.  I'd suggest this article as one of the best explanations that I've found for how IDisposable should actually be used.
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/29534/IDisposable-What-Your-Mother-Never-Told-You-About
For the actual question; should you use IDisposable to clean up managed objects that are taking up a lot of memory the short answer would be no.  The reason is that once your object that is holding the memory goes out of scope it is ready for collection.  At that point any referenced child objects are also out of scope and will get collected.
The only real exception to this would be if you have a lot of memory tied up in managed objects and you've blocked that thread waiting for some operation to complete.  If those objects where not going to be needed after that call completed then setting those references to null might allow the garbage collector to collect them sooner.  But that scenario would represent bad code that needed to be refactored - not a use case of IDisposable.Your given code sample is not a good example for IDisposable usage. Dictionary clearing normally shouldn't go to the Dispose method. Dictionary items will be cleared and disposed when it goes out of scope. IDisposable implementation is required to free some memory/handlers that will not release/free even after they out of scope.

The following example shows a good example for IDisposable pattern with some code and comments.

public class DisposeExample
{
    // A base class that implements IDisposable. 
    // By implementing IDisposable, you are announcing that 
    // instances of this type allocate scarce resources. 
    public class MyResource: IDisposable
    {
        // Pointer to an external unmanaged resource. 
        private IntPtr handle;
        // Other managed resource this class uses. 
        private Component component = new Component();
        // Track whether Dispose has been called. 
        private bool disposed = false;

        // The class constructor. 
        public MyResource(IntPtr handle)
        {
            this.handle = handle;
        }

        // Implement IDisposable. 
        // Do not make this method virtual. 
        // A derived class should not be able to override this method. 
        public void Dispose()
        {
            Dispose(true);
            // This object will be cleaned up by the Dispose method. 
            // Therefore, you should call GC.SupressFinalize to 
            // take this object off the finalization queue 
            // and prevent finalization code for this object 
            // from executing a second time.
            GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
        }

        // Dispose(bool disposing) executes in two distinct scenarios. 
        // If disposing equals true, the method has been called directly 
        // or indirectly by a user's code. Managed and unmanaged resources 
        // can be disposed. 
        // If disposing equals false, the method has been called by the 
        // runtime from inside the finalizer and you should not reference 
        // other objects. Only unmanaged resources can be disposed. 
        protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            // Check to see if Dispose has already been called. 
            if(!this.disposed)
            {
                // If disposing equals true, dispose all managed 
                // and unmanaged resources. 
                if(disposing)
                {
                    // Dispose managed resources.
                    component.Dispose();
                }

                // Call the appropriate methods to clean up 
                // unmanaged resources here. 
                // If disposing is false, 
                // only the following code is executed.
                CloseHandle(handle);
                handle = IntPtr.Zero;

                // Note disposing has been done.
                disposed = true;

            }
        }

        // Use interop to call the method necessary 
        // to clean up the unmanaged resource.
        [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport(""Kernel32"")]
        private extern static Boolean CloseHandle(IntPtr handle);

        // Use C# destructor syntax for finalization code. 
        // This destructor will run only if the Dispose method 
        // does not get called. 
        // It gives your base class the opportunity to finalize. 
        // Do not provide destructors in types derived from this class.
        ~MyResource()
        {
            // Do not re-create Dispose clean-up code here. 
            // Calling Dispose(false) is optimal in terms of 
            // readability and maintainability.
            Dispose(false);
        }
    }
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Insert code here to create 
        // and use the MyResource object.
    }
}There are things that the Dispose() operation does in the example code that might have an effect that would not occur due to a normal GC of the MyCollection object.  

If the objects referenced by _theList or _theDict are referred to by other objects, then that List<> or Dictionary<> object will not be subject to collection but will suddenly have no contents.  If there were no Dispose() operation as in the example, those collections would still contain their contents.

Of course, if this were the situation I would call it a broken design - I'm just pointing out  (pedantically, I suppose) that the Dispose() operation might not be completely redundant, depending on whether there are other uses of the List<> or Dictionary<> that are not shown in the fragment.One problem with most discussions of ""unmanaged resources"" is that they don't really define the term, but seem to imply that it has something to do with unmanaged code.  While it is true that many types of unmanaged resources do interface with unmanaged code, thinking of unmanaged resources in such terms isn't helpful.

Instead, one should recognize what all managed resources have in common: they all entail an object asking some outside 'thing' to do something on its behalf, to the detriment of some other 'things', and the other entity agreeing to do so until further notice.  If the object were to be abandoned and vanish without a trace, nothing would ever tell that outside 'thing' that it no longer needed to alter its behavior on behalf of the object that no longer existed; consequently, the 'thing's usefulness would be permanently diminished.

An unmanaged resource, then, represents an agreement by some outside 'thing' to alter its behavior on behalf of an object, which would useless impair the usefulness of that outside 'thing' if the object were abandoned and ceased to exist.  A managed resource is an object which is the beneficiary of such an agreement, but which has signed up to receive notification if it is abandoned, and which will use such notification to put its affairs in order before it is destroyed.IDisposable is good for unsubscribing from events.First of definition. For me unmanaged resource means some class, which implements IDisposable interface or something created with usage of calls to dll. GC doesn't know how to deal with such objects. If class has for example only value types, then I don't consider this class as class with unmanaged resources.
For my code I follow next practices:


If created by me class uses some unmanaged resources then it means that I should also implement IDisposable interface in order to clean memory. 

Clean objects as soon as I finished usage of it. 

In my dispose method I iterate over all IDisposable members of class and call Dispose.

In my Dispose method call GC.SuppressFinalize(this) in order to notify garbage collector that my object was already cleaned up. I do it because calling of GC is expensive operation.

As additional precaution I try to make possible calling of Dispose() multiple times.

Sometime I add private member _disposed and check in method calls did object was cleaned up. And if it was cleaned up then generate ObjectDisposedException


Following template demonstrates what I described in words as sample of code:





public class SomeClass : IDisposable
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// As usually I don't care was object disposed or not
        /// </summary>
        public void SomeMethod()
        {
            if (_disposed)
                throw new ObjectDisposedException(""SomeClass instance been disposed"");
        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
            Dispose(true);
        }

        private bool _disposed;

        protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            if (_disposed)
                return;
            if (disposing)//we are in the first call
            {
            }
            _disposed = true;
        }
    }The most justifiable use case for disposal of managed resources, is preparation for the GC to reclaim resources that would otherwise never be collected.

A prime example is circular references. 

Whilst it's best practice to use patterns that avoid circular references, if you do end up with (for example) a 'child' object that has a reference back to its 'parent', this can stop GC collection of the parent if you just abandon the reference and rely on GC - plus if you have implemented a finalizer, it'll never be called. 

The only way round this is to manually break the circular references by setting the Parent references to null on the children. 

Implementing IDisposable on parent and children is the best way to do this. When Dispose is called on the Parent, call Dispose on all Children, and in the child Dispose method, set the Parent references to null.",,,,,1,4027,63.33,18.24,31.06,19.35,22.75,25.95,78.94,63.37,51.2,9.11,2.81,1.09,0.02,1.29,0,0.35,6.31,15.35,7.72,0.94,12.14,9.88,4.77,6.06,2.11,16.49,5.56,3.25,2.19,0.32,0.77,1.12,18.1,1.32,16.69,2.26,2.58,2.28,3.43,0.99,4.77,0.74,3.5,1.71,1.79,1.37,0.3,1.07,0,0.02,0.97,0,5.79,3.4,0.12,0,0.07,0.17,2.19,2.31,0.15,0,0,0.02,0.35,0.05,0,0.3,4.1,0,0.05,4,0.02,0.02,0.1,0.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05,0.72,0.1,1.22,0.07,0.05,0.05,0.07,0.3,0.45,4.54,6.51,0.42,0.89,5.02,0.27,0,0.02,3.65,3.28,5.24,1.56,1.07,1.04,0.05,0,0,26.77,6.16,3.4,0.07,0.17,1.91,15.05,

An obfuscator will make it harder for somebody to reverse-engineer (and then steal) your source code. There is a trade-off in that obfuscation has a significant testing burden, and also mess with the stack trace for an unhandled exception.
Copyrighting the binary won't do anything to stop somebody stealing your source. Depending on the country that you use for your software licensing, copyrighting the binary may help you with attacks that aren't aimed at your source code.


If you're using a managed language such as C# or Java, you can use a packer such as Themida or the free MPress to pack your executable into an encrypted wrapper application.

That way you know who download your program and it would be easier to track its usage. 

Edit: I found a great article about software licensing here, you might want to read them too.If you publish just your executable, the only thing that could be done is reverse engineer it.To answer your 2 questions, which are specifically about stealing source code:


An obfuscator will make it harder for somebody to reverse-engineer (and then steal) your source code. There is a trade-off in that obfuscation has a significant testing burden, and also mess with the stack trace for an unhandled exception.
Copyrighting the binary won't do anything to stop somebody stealing your source. Depending on the country that you use for your software licensing, copyrighting the binary may help you with attacks that aren't aimed at your source code.


If you're using a managed language such as C# or Java, you can use a packer such as Themida or the free MPress to pack your executable into an encrypted wrapper application. This will slow down attackers using tools like .NET Reflector, and IMO is a more maintainable approach than using obfuscation.",,,,,1,678,27.41,67.69,16.19,52.09,25.11,20.35,88.5,70.21,58.11,16.81,10.03,2.65,0,6.49,0,0.59,6.78,14.45,6.19,0.29,12.98,9.44,6.19,9.14,2.06,19.17,2.95,1.18,2.95,1.18,0.59,1.18,19.47,0.59,18.88,1.77,3.83,2.95,6.49,0.29,5.31,0,4.42,3.24,1.18,0.88,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,12.98,4.42,1.47,0.29,0.59,0,1.18,8.26,0,0,0,0,2.36,0,0,2.36,6.19,0.29,0,5.6,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,1.77,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,5.6,5.01,0.29,1.18,2.95,0.59,0,0,1.77,1.47,4.72,2.65,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,15.34,5.01,4.42,0.59,0,2.06,3.24,

	Currently, when I use the button, by mistake it will take a full price for already purchased add-on which will lead no refund policy!I'm a little confused as to what you have said there. If there has been a mistake on something in the marketplace, on something you already own, then of course we would take a look at that for you.

	This is exactly what I meant, thanksNot misunderstood at all. We cannot of course account for any external service, if that service is not using the software correctly. Keys should be validated using the API call shown. So in your example above, the situation should be

Questions about Clubs and Mails,"I have some questions or settings. I do not find it so i dont know if it is possible or not. 


	First ,  is that possible to limit the creation of clubs to only some group ? 

	I want that only certain groups can create clubs not everyone.


	Another thing, is it possible to prevent certain groups from sending me private messages or to maybe block the possibility to send me private messages ?


	Thank youIf you edit any group and look on the social tab, you will see you can set whether or not a group can create clubs, and even limit to different types if needed



	With regard PMs there isnt a way in which to do this at present. We do have the ability to disable the PM system coming in the next releaseIs that possible to give Role / group when somoene join the club and remove it if the member quit the club ? 


	thank youClubs are not integrated with the member group system at this time. You may wish to suggest this in our official Feature Suggestion forum if you wish to see it in a future release.You could use IPS webhooks and Zapier to accomplish this.



	unfortunately it will require a paid plan because Webhooks are only available in their paid plans.

Questions about the Forums,"So I'm setting up a new self-hosted installation of an Invision Community forum module (my last one was a number of years ago).  However, I’m running into a few issues that I can’t figure out / remember how to solve.



	 



	Before I get into it, I want to make clear that I did change the URL to the admin CP (via a newly created constants.php file).  However, since I’ve done that, several of the basic links are no longer working.  For instance, if I arrive at the sign and click on the link for “Existing User > Sign In” link, then enter my login information in the drop down, I get an error message that the requested URL was not found.  The requested URL was https://xxxxx.com/login.  



	 



	Besides that (which is important to fix)….



	 



	1) This forum is only for members (no guests).  So if someone arrives at the forum and isn’t logged in, I don’t want to show a blank “Forums” title, but instead show the login page.  I have this set up on my other forum but can’t remember how to do that here.



	 



	2) There are a few other links that are broken, even after you are logged in.  For instance, the main menu shows a link for “Calendar”, and that comes up with a “URL was not found” message.



	 



	3) Is there a way to remove the “Powered by Invision Community” text at the bottom of the pages?  Personally I feel like this is a bit of a security issue.



	 



	Thanks in advance for any assistance!Did you just change the URL of an existing instance?



		Did you truncate the data store?
	
	
		Have you also also changed the base url in the confit file?On 8/31/2022 at 1:00 AM,   Daniel F said: 

	
		
			Did you just change the URL of an existing instance?
		

		
				Did you truncate the data store?

	This was a new installation.  So I believe the URL was set for me in conf_global.php (the value for ""base_url"" is correct anyway).  I only changed the CP URL (""CP_DIRECTORY"") in the constant.php file.  Nothing else is in there.



	I did not do anything to the data store.  Is there some place i can go to purge that?



			
				


	Edited August 31 by Todd Richards1Is your htaccess file properly setup and correct for this host?As Randy mentioned, it sounds like you may have enabled Rewritten URLs but did not properly setup the .htaccess. You can find this file in ACP -> System -> Search Engine Optimization.

	This is not a security issue necessarily by itself as it does not disclose a version number or anything of that nature that is specific. Most competent attackers will also just know you're running our software by the outputted information on the page. They won't need a banner stating it.



	However, should you wish to remove this for any reason, you would need to purchase our Branding Remove license by going to the Client Area -> Manage Purchases -> click your license ->  Manage Your Community. It is a $500 USD one time fee at the time of writing this.So I had Friendly URLs enabled.  When I upload the .htaccess file, I get a 500 error and can't get see the home page or the CP.  When I rename the .htaccess file (so it doesn't exist), then I can get into the CP.  Strange.



	Also, when clicking around the CP, a lot of links aren't working.  For instance, I get an error message trying to access the log files.

	Please ensure that if you have an existing .htaccess file, you rename that. Please also ensure you have mod_rewrite installed (that really shouldn't cause a 500 error though).



	If you're still having issues, a 500 Internal Server Error is very much like a check engine light. It says something is wrong but not exactly what or where. You would need to contact your hosting provider or server administrator to obtain the server error log entry for that issue. You will want to have them review for any server errors and pass any software errors to us.

	What is the error message? Is it a page not found? If so, you may wish to see if you have mod_security or another security module enabled on your server. If so, this may be blocking you from performing certain things and you will need to either disable it or work with your provider/server administrator so that these actions are allowed.OK, turns out that the ""Options -MultiViews""  line in the .htaccess file was the culprit.  Once I removed this, the login on the front-end started working, and no more error messages in the CP!

	Was this plugin the cause of the issue?I don't know its not like I can turn it off and wait a few weeks for the particularly RSS feed to post to the blog.If you can send me the RSS Feed URL that you're grabbing from, I can test this on my test installation. If it does not render this then it would be an issue likely with something third party on your community.feed:https://www.filemakermagazine.com/rss.xmlI have the same RSS importing in to a blog and also a forum the tag doesn't show in the forum but does in the blog, so it's definitely related to blog rss import.Unfortunately, I did not have any issues with the tag on importing this RSS into a blog. If you are able to create a new test blog to test this with the third party applications/plugins disabled, I would advise doing that.I have created a test blog, and disabled the app, and imported the same RSS feed. No [] tags were present.



	I deleted the blog created a new blog with the app running and imported the same RSS feed. Same result NO tags were present.



	Must be something with this one old blog that it defaults to [] tag.Please could you provide that test example?My Test: https://fmforums.com/blogs/blog/124-test/



	(this was done with the Application Radical Tags installed and active NO TAGS )



	 



	Original RSS: https://fmforums.com/blogs/entry/2982-sql-multi-table-query-optimization/



	Only the latest along in the original RSS has the empty tags I had manually cleared older posts. 



	 



	There is something lingering in OLD blogs that seem to insert the array [] 



	 



	I plan to delete the test blog in a few hours just FYI.You would really need to do your test with nothing in terms of 3rd party items added. If you have radical tags installed, it may well be what is causing issuesBut it works just fine with it installed on a new test blog importing the RSS even if the APP is off it works just fine on NEWLY created blogs with RSS.



	It's something with OLDER blogs set up years ago with RSS imports.

	While, it may be working in cases, it would need to be removed for complete testing to rule it out.I do not have a blog feed that I can turn things off and wait around till someone gets around to posting a blog article. So it is impossible to test waiting for a posting.

RSS Feed Import Post IP Address,"We have a couple of RSS Feeds that are being imported to Forums on our site and everything is working great.  No problems with the Feeds and setup was easy.  All Feed imports use the same User account as the Author, which is a dedicated User account (""NewsFeed"") that is not used by any 'real' user.



	However, we have noted that the IP Address recorded for the Feed Posts in the forum use what appear to be another User's IP Address.  In all cases, the IP Address has been used by other User - so they aren't truly random.  While there is no real harm per-se, it is confusing for Moderators and Admins that are attempting to trace activity for specific Users across the system.



	I would suggest using either the Forum's host IP Address or the IP Address of the RSS Feed's host when recording the Address in the RSS Feed Post.  This would remove the 'random' appearance of addresses and should eliminate any confusion of commonality with other Users.



	Thoughts?

RSS Feeds Take Hours To Update (Cloud),"I use RSS feeds from my databases (just the standard ones enabled with the database itself) and it often takes hours, if not an entire 8hr workday for new content to get pushed to the feed.  I never had this issue before moving to the Cloud.  I don't see any setting that could effect this either.



	 



	E.G: I am still waiting for this article (https://www.uncrownedgaming.com/home/esports/the-call-of-duty-league-championship-kicks-off-today-r80/) to get pushed to its RSS feed (https://www.uncrownedgaming.com/home/?rss=1) and it has been almost 6 hours since posting.



	 



	EDIT: Actually once it does go to the feed, the feed does not seem to be pushing it out anywhere.  Even basic readers like Feedly are not picking up the new articles once they are added to the feed for an extended period of time.  Which I don't have any issues with on all my non-cloud projects or any RSS feed to be honest.



			
				


	Edited August 4 by UncrownedGuardUnfortunately, I am seeing that article present in the feed. If you go straight to the RSS feed are you seeing the article? If the feed clients you use only update at a certain interval, you will need to await the client to update from your community, I'm afraid. We do not have control over that.To put some times on the issue.



	The article was posted at 0800 via a scheduled post.

	The first sighting of it from the RSS was on Feedly at 1331



	This is not my normal experience with any RSS feed including my numerous IPS feeds.



	 



	At the same time, the article that was published and live to the community at 0800 is now relisted as a 1323 published time.

	Unfortunately, the article should keep the previous publish date, even when editing so this would require manual involvement for it to change or there is something else acting on this field. I would advise watching it and disabling any related third party add-ons to Pages if you continue to see any issue.On 8/4/2022 at 1:44 PM,   Jim M said:

"RSS for ""Downloads"" not grabbing correct Image.","I cannot seem to find any posts about this issue, so maybe there is something on my end?

	I use online 3rd parties to repost my content to social media. I have been using Zapier as it is very fancy, but expensive. So I decided to try another service, and it reads my RSS, but then it was grabbing the first image in my description tag (So I thought!) I went to read over my RSS, and sure enough, the <Enclosure url=""XXX"" is the first image in the description tag. 

	It should be showing the main thumbnail image instead. I went over to a few other sites that I KNOW use the Invision Community, but they are always a few updates behind, and they are not having this issue. I have been disabling 3rd party apps trying to figure out what could be causing this but none of them seem to make a difference. is anyone else having this issue?Do you have an example of this that I can take a look at?Sure. Here is my ""Downloads"" Directory. and there is RSS feeds options at the bottom to compare with.
My Website.Could you please provide us which RSS feed specifically you are using? We would like to compare apples to apples on what you're mentioning here.lol. Sorry, I didn't even think of that. The one I am currently working with is THIS one.

	If I post a link to any social media, the Embed always grabs the correct image, but the RSS instead shows the first image in the description instead. I played around and made an RSS for Forums, one for Pages, etc., and all of those seem to work correctly. It's just my Downloads, and the issue is the URL in the ""Enclosure"" node. I am currently building a C# application and I'm using my RSS feeds to grab some information for the application. but this is a real hang up.Before we go any further through this, please update your site to the latest release of the software. You appear to be a version behind (soon to be 2).



	You would then need to ensure the user you have on file has access to see the items in that feed if you still have an issue. We dont seem to have that access at the moment unfortunately.My father passed away 2 weeks ago so I took a step back to deal with my life, and since the next one was soon to come out, I was going to just wait until next came out. I will go ahead and update and I will update 3rd party apps as well, and run thru all my processes again and I will report back here once I have exhausted all my tests and ideas.Very sorry to hear about your father. Please let us know once you have managed to get that done, and we can take a closers look if needed.On 8/30/2022 at 10:06 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

	Thank you. I have now updated everything and I have the same result. I must also ask, is there a place in the ACP where I can append the RSS, basically where I can add an author node for example? or is the only way to edit such, is by editing the PHP?  I do realize I could obtain all this information via Webhooks, but I am still learning webhooks at the moment. It would easily solve many issues, but for now I am going to create things based off of RSS. I have created a Forum which is filled with content that is imported via RSS, and that works perfect. But when I am grabbing my own RSS that is exporting an RSS feed of my downloads, everything is all messed up. I can read my RSS from Forums (Topics actually), and that is all good. I would compare using this website, but Invision doesn't post an RSS for Downloads.Im not sure what you mean in regards adding a user ID. What is it you are trying to achieve? If the RSS feed URL from the front end is used by an individual, that link would have that users permissions. Please could you explain further on that?As far as asking to be able to edit (Or add info to) the RSS, I'm asking is there a way to add information like ""Author"" for example, the person who posted the content. I noticed there is no ""Author"" node. As most places usually have Author included as well as a few other things. I was wondering if there was a tool, I may have overlooked that may allow us website owners to add more nodes inside the ""Item"" categories.



	As we all know, Information is great, the more I can provide, the more that others can take advantage of and make use with. There is a fine line between too much info, and not enough. I think by default, there is just not enough, and I would like to add to it. Of course, if it has to be done via PHP, then that is something out of my skill set, but if it is in a setting somewhere (Which i cannot find) then That would be just awesome!


	But honestly, I should have asked this in a different Forum. I am mainly trying to fix my RSS feed, then I would like to be able to add information to it.Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention! I can confirm this should be further reviewed and I have logged an internal bug report for our development team to investigate and address as necessary, in a future maintenance release.Honestly, I will admit, I was betting it was something on my end, I was hoping for advice to fix it, usually it is on my end.

	This is the HTML page for a 500 Server Error. Are you still receiving this via CRON?Hi Jim.



	Yup, via Cron. So I went into my cPanel to see if the Cron matched the one on the site. Seems to. Re-entered it just in case. Now I'm waiting to see if it fixed it (don't think it did, but we'll see).



	In other news, still no feedback from E. at Headstand. That FAQ error is still going also.I'd check your System Log for any errors but ultimately, CRON shouldn't be hitting that error, unless it was temporary while you were having another issue.Deactivated FAQ and all the errors stopped.

Random post approval?,"Hi all,



	Have a problem that appears to be random.



	Members posts are requiring approval. I have inquired with each person as to their account status, what device or browser they are using. If the content is restricted. I can not find any correlation to lead me to the source of the problem.



	I have read on the forum there is a new update for a post approval ""reason"" to be viewable. So we can understand why it is flagged.



	 



	My question is. Can I just unilaterally across all settings options TURN OFF any post needing approval. Really just need this to go away. It's becoming a big chore and is killing my membership growth. Members are frustrated.



	Thanks so much.Maybe you have restricted links?I dug around and searched for restricted links options. I don't see anything. Where can I find this settings area to check ?On 8/11/2022 at 9:06 PM,   MeanGene said:

Rating in forums,"When I should enable the Rating for forum? How it works and how it affect our forum management?It's not really a question of when. Rather, do you need your users to be able to rate topics (from either 1 to 5 or 1 to 10 stars) on the forum?



	For example I've seen some sites using the rating function for a forum where topics are actually reviews of products and people vote the topic based on the review's quality. Do you have something similar that requires enabling the rating option?



	As for how it works: people can simply vote X stars but the voting itself doesn't really impact forum management.

	Am I understanding the system wrong?



	Or do I have to set something differently?



	I did check permissions and every group is supposed to have access to the rating.Looks like you recently switch to HTTPS or changed your URL. Due to this it looks like some Javascript wasn't loading properly as it was referencing an old URL. I have cleared your cache and other Javascript related items are functioning now. As we do not have a login to the front-end of your website with your SSO, please test the rating system and let us know if it is working or not.I have had https for a few years now so I didn't recently do anything.

	Please provide us a login to your SSO and we can take a look. You can add this in the notes section of the Access Details area of the Client Area.



	We would need to look further into this for you, however the access details on file appear to be incorrect or missing. Could you please update these details by visiting your client area, selecting the relevant purchase, then clicking ""Review/Update Access Information"" under the ""Stored Access Information"" section. 



	We look forward to further assisting you.Thanks @Jim M



	I have added a temporary admin account information on the Access Information.



	I am still waiting on any information from the SSO plugin author.Please ensure you have provided the permission for a group to be able to rate images. This can be in ACP -> Members -> Groups -> edit group -> content tab -> Can give star ratings for content?



	Once I gave that permission, our test user was able to leave ratings on Gallery images where the Gallery category allowed it. Please also note that a user can disable ratings on their album so if a user has done that, it will not be available.On 9/1/2022 at 10:51 AM,   Jim M said:

	You're very welcome. Glad to hear it is working for you.



	Can think of it as often the setting on the application/category whether or not those items are enabled for the application/category. Then the member group setting controls whether or not that specific member group can use it.



	We are always trying to simplify these settings/permissions down, as you're right, often it is a little overwhelming. Especially, when just starting your community.

Registration page checkbox,"Hi,



	We've been having users reporting issues registering for our site, and the problem has turned out to be the final terms of use checkbox that they are required to select.



	The problem reported is that when they try to click it, it won't select. I have even stood by users and watched them struggle with this and give up... and to be fair, I can't really blame them, because see our checkbox is a bit of a UI/UX quagmire - requiring the user to click on exactly the right place to get the checkbox to toggle:



	


	This is a tougher challenge than it might seem - I can't be there to explain to every user ""you need to click on the text... no, the text... no not the checkbox, the text itself... no not the blue text, that's a link - the text in-between the checkbox and the first bit of blue text... no you can't click the checkbox directly, you need to click on the text NEXT to the checkbox, but not on the link...""



	Other people must have encountered this issue? I have seen this multiple times, and have had actual interactions with users like the one above during user testing.



	I would modify the template but it appears to be rendered out in popupRegisterTemplate at around line 81:


						{{foreach $content as $input}}
							{{if \is_object( $input ) }}
								{$input->rowHtml($form)|raw}
							{{else}}
								{$input|raw}
							{{endif}}
						{{endforeach}}


	the line:


{$input->rowHtml($form)|raw}


	...and fixing this appears to be non-trivial; there looks to be some rogue javascript buried somewhere that is toggling the checkbox off and disabling it.



	Can anybody suggest a simple solution to this? Putting a line of text instruction underneath is not really helping (and is a bit ugly when we could just fix the UI!). Is this some sort of EU/GDPR requirement?



	regards

	Then there is something broken on your site. You can certainly click on the checkbox. Example from this website:Sounds like a theme issue. Does this happen on a stock unmodified theme?  If so, have you disabled your various plugins and custom applications?Well that's odd.



	Our theme is basically stock, we've only changed some colours and added some text.



	We don't have any plugins, and the only integrations we have are GeoIP Service, Spam Defence and Google Analytics. I have tried disabling all three of those and still had the same issue.



	I tried creating a new blank theme though and the checkbox works so... go figure.



	Thanks for the suggestion; I guess I'll have to start again and copy everything over one by one.


	Fixed! My bad. Was actually just some rogue CSS we included. Grr. Thanks for the suggestions.Glad you got it squared away!  It’s hard sometimes to figure it out without going back to the basics!!

	Always bare in mind that when stating ""we've only changed"", this is by very definition custom. Its always worth checking those items first, as you have seen there. The simplest way to check first of all is by going to support in the admin CP, clicking customisation overview, and clicking disable.

Rehash: Accounting Software Design Patterns,"Back in October, Kristopher Johnson asked about Accounting Software Design Patterns He received several answers, but they were all basically the same, pointing to Martin Fowlers Accounting Patterns. I don't really find Fowlers patterns all that useful.  They seem overly complex for a more simplistic accounting system, so I'm rehashing Kristopher's question and looking for more options, preferably for smaller systems. This would be primarily a cash based system in which users are given accounts similar to a bank.  They can log in (web based) and check balances, make certain transactions, etc.. I guess it would be more similar to a Paypal or Credit Card company than a bank, but on a smaller scale.  It won't have to deal with taxes, or Amortizations, or any of the things you would see in a full fledged accounting system.  Just balances, and transactions. So can anyone point to any additional resources for accounting based software design or even good implementations of a simple accounting system?Fowler's patterns are not overly complex. They are about what is needed. You are unlikely to be able to build something simpler without getting in trouble with either the end users or the accountant.So can anyone point to any additional resources for accounting based software design or even good implementations of a simple accounting system?


The Free Digital Money Project looks helpful for your needs. It provides a basic transaction and balance framework. It is intentionally simple and abstract, so may offer useful design insights, particularly if you want to test novel ideas.

Cyclos is more practical. It covers user accounts and transactions.

MyBanco is another open source banking system, supporting user bank accounts and web-based access. It can be used with both virtual and real currencies.

All of these are open source so you can check out the docs, architecture and code directly.

As an aside, if you are really only interested in balances and transactions, then it sounds like any pattern or project related to reputation, karma, or points systems will likely have relevant overlap...When I implement accounting it's the typical model of a journals, transactions and accounts and account types.

tblTransactions
    - Amount
    - AccountID1
    - AccountID2
    - Type [CR/DR]
    - DateEntered


I then also have a tblJournals which groups transactions on the obvious basis. You may also add JournalTypes, which hold a general description of what sort of journal it is, so you can detect nice things (reverals, etc).

It's nice, because reversals under this model are trivial. You can just gather all the transactions for your journal, and swap the type.

The tblTransactions has a trigger, and the trigger updates a 'CalculatedBalance' against the specific accounts depending on the type. You can then also run a report over a given period, and so on.

It doesn't require much accounting knowledge to implement this and is simple, yet effective.Google search for ""two phase commit""

Not a design pattern per se but you need to make sure operations like 
""transfer $amount from $account1 to $account2"" don't ever ""withdraw"" without the matching ""deposit""... i.e. if the power goes out before the ""deposit"" completes, the ""withdraw"" is rolled back (undone)

Commit-able Transactions are made up of undo-able (rollback-able) sub-transactions... 


acquire permissions needed: trivial rejection, ""insufficient
funds"" 
start a ""two phase commit""  
add sub-transactions 
commit or roll-back

Release Management Software,"If you're looking to provide WSUS like functionality, can you use that? If you are already playing nice with the windows installer it shouldn't be too difficult from what I can see. 

See this example for a way to publish updates to wsus. There's also a powershell script here that demonstrates publishing an msp to wsus

It looks like you need to make your own reporting interface, but I'd have to imagine that'd be easier than building wsus v4.

I'm assuming this is for ""internal"" distribution (where you can control the automatic updates client). If you're looking to provide something 'customer facing' that's probably no help at all ;)Since you mention multiple platforms, and graphics drivers, but not java/c#, I presume you have (may have) exe's to specific platforms.  Hence the Java Web Start and ClickOnce options are not for you...

Hansel Minutes had a recent chat with the Paint.Net guy largely about their installer, which seems to be a 3 or 4 layered thing.  That might be worth checking out.On the topic of Release Management, I'm investigating my options for software that will essentially perform the features WSUS offers as far as I'm aware (remote installation, version querying, per-machine/group settings, etc) but for my custom software.

Remote origin already exists on 'git push' to a new repository,"I have my project on GitHub at some location, git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git. Now I want to push all my code to a new repository at some other location, git@github.com:newname/newrep.git I used the command: but I am receiving this: fatal: remote origin already exists.You are getting this error because ""origin"" is not available. ""origin"" is a convention not part of the command. ""origin"" is the local name of the remote repository.

For example you could also write:

git remote add myorigin git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git  
git remote add testtest git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git


See the manual: 

http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html

To remove a remote repository you enter:

git remote rm origin


Again ""origin"" is the name of the remote repository if you want to
remove the ""upstream"" remote:

git remote rm upstreamThe previous solutions seem to ignore origin, and they only suggest to use another name. When you just want to use git push origin, keep reading.

The problem appears because a wrong order of Git configuration is followed. You might have already added a 'git origin' to your .git configuration.

You can change the remote origin in your Git configuration with the following line:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/projectname.git


This command sets a new URL for the Git repository you want to push to.
Important is to fill in your own username and projectnameIf you have mistakenly named the local name as ""origin"", you may remove it with the following:

git remote rm originMETHOD1->

Since origin already exist remove it.

git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git


METHOD2->

One can also change existing remote repository URL by ->git remote set-url

If you're updating to use HTTPS

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git


If you're updating to use SSH

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git


If trying to update a remote that doesn't exist you will receive a error. So be careful of that.

METHOD3->

Use the git remote rename command to rename an existing remote.
An existing remote name, for example, origin.

git remote rename origin startpoint
# Change remote name from 'origin' to 'startpoint'


To verify remote's new name->

git remote -v


If new to Git try this tutorial->

TRY GIT TUTORIALYou can simply edit your configuration file in a text editor.

In the ~/.gitconfig you need to put in something like the following:

        user = myname
        token = ff44ff8da195fee471eed6543b53f1ff


In the oldrep/.git/config file (in the configuration file of your repository):

[remote ""github""]
        url = git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git
        push  = +refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*
        push  = +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*


If there is a remote section in your repository's configuration file, and the URL matches, you need only to add push configuration. If you use a public URL for fetching, you can put in the URL for pushing as 'pushurl' (warning: this requires the just-released Git version 1.6.4).git remote rm origin
git remote -v
It will not display any repository name
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/myapp.git
git push origin master
It will start the process and creating the new branch.
You can see your work is pushed to github.I had the same issue, and here is how I fixed it, after doing some research:

Download GitHub for Windows, or use something similar, which includes a shell.
Open the Git Shell from the task menu. This will open a power shell including Git commands.
In the shell, switch to your old repository, e.g. cd C:\path\to\old\repository.
Show the status of the old repository.


Type git remote -v to get the remote path for fetch and push remote. If your local repository is connected to a remote, it will show something like this:
 origin  https://user@bitbucket.org/team-or-user-name/myproject.git (fetch)
 origin  https://user@bitbucket.org/team-or-user-name/myproject.git (push)


If it's not connected, it might show origin only.



Now remove the remote repository from the local repository by using
git remote rm origin


Check again with git remote -v, as in step 4. It should show origin only, instead of the fetch and push path.

Now that your old remote repository is disconnected, you can add the new remote repository. Use the following to connect to your new repository:


Note: In case you are using Bitbucket, you would create a project on Bitbucket first. After creation, Bitbucket will display all required Git commands to push your repository to remote, which look similar to the next code snippet. However, this works for other repositories as well.
cd /path/to/my/repo # If you haven't done that yet.
git remote add mynewrepo https://user@bitbucket.org/team-or-user-name/myproject.git
git push -u mynewrepo master # To push changes for the first time.

That's it.git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/myapp.gitYou don't have to remove your existing ""origin"" remote, just use a name other than ""origin"" for your remote add, e.g.

git remote add github git@github.com:myname/oldrep.gitI had the same problem when I first set up using Bitbucket.

My problem was that I needed to change the word origin for something self-defined. I used the name of the application. So:

git remote add AppName https://someone@bitbucket.org/somewhere/something.gitYou should change the name of the remote repository to something else.

git remote add origin git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git


to

git remote add neworigin git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git


I think this should work.

Yes, these are for repository init and adding a new remote. Just with a change of name.The below two commands should help set up.
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/NEW_REPO.git
    
git push --set-upstream origin mainYou could also change the repository name you wish to push to in the REPOHOME/.git/config file

(where REPOHOME is the path to your local clone of the repository).This can also happen when you forget to make a first commit.You need to check the origin and add if not exists.

if ! git config remote.origin.url >/dev/null; then
    git remote add origin git@github.com:john/doe.git
fi


Create file check.sh, paste the script update your git repository URL and run ./check.sh.I had the same issue but I found the solution to it. Basically ""origin"" is another name from where your project was cloned. Now the error
fatal: remote origin already exists.

LITERALLY means origin already exists. And hence to solve this issue, our goal should be to remove it.
For this purpose:
git remote rm origin

Now add it again
git remote add origin https://github.com/__enter your username here__/__your repositoryname.git__

This did fix my issue.I just faced this issue myself and I just removed it by removing the origin.
the origin is removed by this command
git remote rm origin

if you've added the remote repo as origin try implementing this command.Try to remove first existing origin, In order to see the which existing origin has registered with bash you can fire below command.
 git remote -v 

after you know the which version of origin has register with bash then you can remove existing origin by firing below command
git remote rm origin

Once you removed existing origin you can add new origin by firing below command in you case ..
git remote add origin git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git

Once you add your origin in git, then you can push your local commit to remote origin
git push -u origin --allStep:1

git remote rm origin


Step:2

git remote add origin enter_your_repository_url


Example:

git remote add origin https://github.com/my_username/repository_name.gitif you want to create a new repository with the same project inside the github and the previous Remote is not allowing you to do that in that case First Delete That Repository on github  then you simply need to delete the .git folder C:\Users\Shiva\AndroidStudioProjects\yourprojectname\.git delete that folder,(make sure you click on hidden file because this folder is hidden )

Also click on the minus(Remove button) from the android studio Setting->VersionControl
click here for removing the Version control from android  And then you will be able to create new Repository.Try this command it works for me.
rm -rf .git/git remote rm origin

Remove all guest posts from entire forum,"Since Invision decided to allow ""posts by guests"" and setting it on by default, our forum has been ruined by about 365000 guest posts from Russian spam bots.

	The update subscription to fix your exploits is a cash earning module and doesn't take into consideration helping the clients. We had a very popular forum which was ruined by your new features and security exploits.



	 



	Now we are trying to clean up the forum by simply removing all the GUEST posts! Sorry, this function does not exist.



	 



	How can I batch / bulk delete all comments posted by GUESTS????? and why isn't this feature in the forum by default. What kind of a forum in this day in age where 95% of internet traffic is spam bots, allows people to post without making accounts? the CAPCHA is a joke, it can be bypassed easily.



	 



	Please advise how to remove all the guests and delete all of their posts. We're not interested in having our forum selling russian knock offs of viagra..

	If this feature isn't added fixed or whatever it takes, this will be the downfall of this software.

	No captcha will ever be 100%. While it may appear that everything is getting through, this will certainly not be the case (feel free to switch it off, and you will see the comparison pretty quickly).



	We certainly wish we could come up with a solution which would stop all spam on a permanent basis. Unfortunately, these days, many of these spam bots are sophisticated and just circumvent any measures put in place. And this is when they are bots at all, as often they are actually people posting. The reality is, the only way to stop guest spam posting completely, is to remove guests from posting completely.

Remove/Delete Fraudulent Pending Invoices,"Just today alone I have thirty-eight pages of pending invoices that stripe.com has blocked as fraudulent. Looks like they are coming from my donation button. For the time I have removed it and trying to clean up these invoices. In total I have 1200+, all pending, all marked as fraud. Is there a way to cancel/remove them all in one go? The clicking cancel then delete for each one is proving to be very time consuming. 



	I have an IP of this person; can they be blocked from the site via an IP? Man, this is out of control. The invoices are like seven every second, a bot or something.You should be able to delete the invoice/transaction straight up from the invoice listing screen.

	I have rebuilt the leaderboard but nothing has changed and those crazy numbers still appear.Hmm, sounds like something else is wrong then. Try checking the reactions in your ACP and see how many points they add every time one is used. Usually they're setup to add/remove 1 point (or 0 points). Maybe the conversion setup the points to a higher value?

	Reactions are +1 or 0.I guess the next step would be recounting the reputation then. Keep in mind that recounting the reputation will not consider deleted content.



	 



	The option for it is in a bit of a weird location:



		Edit any random member in your ACP.
	
	
		Top-right you'll see REPUTATION LEVEL, click the arrow to open a dropdown menu and click Recount.
	
	
		A popup with 3 options will appear, click Recount for all members.
	
	
		Once the recount is done you may need to rebuild the leaderboard again.
	

	It the above still doesn't work there's most likely an issue with the conversion.I would certainly try rebuilding first of all. You are likely going to need to do that regardless of outcome here.

Reuse preinstalled software in Azure,"Sometimes installing new software takes a lot of time. I would like to install software in the VM and reuse this software later in new VMs. There are two ways to do that. In the first case I would just create a new VM directly from that image, in the second case I would attach the disk after the new VM is created. Which way is preferable and possible at all?Let me try to address your two points below. 

1) An image is really about creating a sys prepped [1] version from an existing Azure VM ( that presumably has all the software you need installed). 

Once you have captured the image, you can then create additional VM(s) based on it.  

You can also go Azure Marketplace or VM Depot [2] and choose from a  set of pre-built images and easily spin VMs based on it. This is the quickest way to get up and running with a VM. 

2)

A disk is created from an image when you provision a VM. By default an OS disk will be created. But if your image includes data disks those will also be added to the VM. 

To your point, #2 allows you to attach additional data disks (number of disks you can attach depends on the size of the VM you are creating). Note that you can attach an empty or an existing disk.

S3 File Storage Move Failing,"So I recently tried changing my downloads file storage from the local server to S3. I set up a cron and even tried running the maintenance tasks manually, but nothing is moving over. I can't stop the change because it says no changes can be made while a move is in process (there should be a cancel option)




	

	. At first I got an error about the PHP upload size limit, which was 2M (I updated this to 16M), but now I am getting this error when I try to manually run the tasks:


Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 2147483648 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 1077367400 bytes) in /var/www/vhosts/swrebellion.net/httpdocs/system/Http/Request/Sockets.php on line 247


	 



	There has got to be a way to abort this process and remove the S3 storage option altogether.



			
				


	Edited September 6 by Ryan MYou have the same issue there. You are running out of memory.  You would need to up your memory limit again in order to ensure there is enough for moving large files across.



	There is no cancel option, as this has already been started, and even if that button were to exist, it would actually have to start a move process itself (to move the items its already moved back)@Marc Stridgen



	imo it tried to allocate 2+1GB here.

	very few servers allow that much ram for PHP. does the whole file need to be in memory for the upload?

	So server options in the control panel don't allow me more than 16M for the upload_max_filesize but I manually edited php.ini so I think it is set for 100M now.


	So I started the manual run again and it just spins looking like this. We'll see what happens. My largest file is just under 90M

	At the moment less than 200MThe problem is that you are changing the wrong value. Its memory_limit that you need to be increasingCurrent memory limit is 128M. My largest file it should be trying to transfer is only 85MB. There are only 7 files of this type listed in the admin center, and the rest of them are under 2MB. I had the ""run tasks manually"" page up attempting to run for the last 4 hours and according to the dashboard, progress meters for everything are at 0.




	This will basically be a showstopper if none of the background tasks ever can run.,.



	


	 



	What I also wonder about is why the background process manual run page gets stuck on ""Starting ..."" with a spinning ""thinking"" circle. If I recall correctly, it usually would have numbers like X processes of (total) completed and would frequently refresh that number.



	I can't even check the settings of the S3 storage to see if I notice anything wrong since it won't let me view it while it is attempting to move files, though I think I would have seen an error of some kind if it weren't connectiving at all.Sorry, Im a little confused here. You had checked your error logs and it states there that you are out of memory, which is what is causing you the issue. This would not necessarily correlate to file size. If you havent upped the memory limit since you were trying this last, then nothing will change. You need to temporarily significantly increase your memory limit setting.I did up the limit to 256M with no difference in results. Is there a specific higher limit I should try?



	I also want to mention this is a dedicated server, not a VPS or shared host.



			
				


	Edited September 6 by Ryan MAs you stated this was the error, it was trying to allocate over 2G


Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 2147483648 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 1077367400 bytes)Ah yes, sorry about that. So I upped the memory limit to 2G and then to 4G and I am still seeing similar or same errors. I verified the config with phpinfo. Since no files have moved, is there a way I can delete the move task somewhere in the db or a config file and then delete the S3 endpoint? There has got to be a way to stop it, otherwise all tasks won't run and be stuck because its holding it up, making the backend functions of the community stop working.


	Any chance of you guys connecting to take a look?Sorry, could I clarify here, its not yet moved anything at all to your s3 bucket?Edit: I checked the bucket - I am seeing some things in there - not sure if it has anything else to move though, I only chose ""File Downloads"" category.

SDLC and Software Process,"I have some confusion about the terms SDLC and Software Process. With respect to these (and more or less similar) terms, a have a few question.SDLC stands for System Development Life Cycle, and it is a more or less generic term to describe whatever standard life cycle that you have implemented is.

SDLC is essentially your software process, but in my experience, most people associate it more directly with waterfall processes, as you indicated and more specifically, CMMI standards.

Typically with the SDLC, you will find that different groups have different methodologies to express it. 

Since I don't recall the exact definition, there may be more linking it to the waterfall methods than just semantics. For instance, I believe Agile methodologies could be considered a type of SDLC, but I could be wrong about that.

I hope this helps.SDLC in shortcut for software development life cycle for a software product that contains the process for a product the software from requirement software.. maintenance
the SDLC  that contain viruses methodologies like waterfall ,scream,agile   that follow each the process software from the requirement , design, implementation, testing, maintains but
different to how to apply this process some methodologies  as agile do the multi-process in same time as implementation with  design in want to write Document.
in a waterfall, methodology cont go to apply the next process until the previous process finish  cont do mult process at the same time example cont be go implementation with the design in the same time you should be complete the design process cont be execution 2 process at same timeSoftware Process - is a set of activities and associated results that produce a software product. There are 4 fundamental process activities that are common to all software processes


Software Specification
Software Development
Software Validation
Software Evolution


SDLC - is the oldest and the most widely used approach in software engineering.It follows a number of sequential phases and partitioned set of activities. Based in an engineering/construction/production new.


Problem exploration
Feasibility Study
Requirement Gathering
Analysis
Design
Construction
IS implementation
Operation and Maintenance
Evoluation

 - Phase out


I very much agree with you, SDLC dates back to the 1950s and it was the first framework introduced at the time. However, I have a few notes on the SDLC phases - I'd say that there are 7 stages of the SDLC:
1.Planning
2. Requirements Analysis
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing 
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance and improvement.

Today, there are a lot of SDLC models, Waterfall being the most popular one. Though, Agile is becoming quite popular lately - yet, I find a lot of teams to be highly disappointed of Agile. ""We are constantly changing things that we never get anything done"" - that's the most common phrase I hear.What is the difference between SDLC and Software Process ? (I understand SDLC is not just Waterfall).
Ans: SDLC is the development lifecycle that is used in each and every project.SDLC defines all the standard phases which is very useful in software development. Software Process defines all the activities/phases to improve the quality of the product.


Software process is the testing lifecycle as it includes all the phases even the basic phases.


Can we map SDLC with Unified Process?
Ans: Yes you can map but only methodologies not the life cycle",,,,,1,553,76.45,25.45,40.66,27.41,19.75,30.02,77.22,58.41,49.01,8.86,3.98,2.17,0.54,1.27,0,0,4.88,16.82,8.86,2.35,11.03,8.14,4.34,4.88,0.72,12.66,7.05,5.61,2.17,1.27,0.72,0.18,12.48,1.27,11.21,2.71,1.27,1.63,1.99,0,3.8,0.18,1.63,1.08,0.54,0.54,0.18,0.36,0,0,0.18,0,5.24,2.17,0.36,0,0,0.36,1.27,2.17,0,0,0,0,3.62,0,0,3.62,3.07,0,0,3.07,0,0,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.72,0.36,0.36,0,0.18,0,0,0.18,0.36,4.34,6.51,0.18,1.45,4.52,0,0.36,0,3.8,1.08,4.88,0.9,0.36,0,0.36,0,0,14.29,5.79,4.16,0.36,0,0.54,3.44,

Sharing content from a members-only community,"Hi.



	We are running a members-only community from which we would like to share individual topics or posts. Possible implementations:



	1) Member could share her individual topic/post on social media. Guest following link back access just that specific topic/post



	2) Member -""- other member’s individual topic/post -""- 



	3) Moderators managing 1 and 2 above for topics/posts of their choice



	Has anyone solved how to do this, or has any ideas on how to - without adding 3rd party solutions?

	 



	/JoachimThere is no way in which to do this within the core platform. The only option for this is 3rd party developmentIs it possible to copy, not move, a post from one forum to another? (We haven't found any solution on this in the IPB guides or in the support forum.) Such functionality would  open up for a solution.Unfortunately not. What you are looking for there is quite a unique thing. Generally duplicating content would be seen as a bad thing.



	Could I ask here, if you are thinking of duplicating it elsewhere, what the difference is to them seeing the original?


	I guess what Im asking here, is what are you trying to achieve?Assuming a paid member-only forum.

	Posted Social Media links shouldn't and wouldn't work for the guests using them. We obviously don’t want to grant read-rights to all the content, just chosen posts. Since there aren’t privileges on the post level, but on the forum level, we could make the chosen posts visible for guests by copying them to a separate dedicated open-to-guests forum. We don’t want to move the posts since this would drain the paid forum.



	But since there is no copy function this workaround does not work.



	All workaround proposals are welcome.



	/JoachimUnfortunately, as you mentioned, permissions are not at the post-level but forum-level. Additionally, the software was not built to have content in 2 places for 2 different userbases (as Marc mentioned. I am not aware of a way to accomplish this via third party existing tools so this might need to be custom if its something you need).



	Therefore, you have two options really:



		You tailor your forums to what you want your guests to see. If it's content X but not content A, B, C... then that would need to be tailored in your forum category decisions.
	
	
		If you don't want to give guests access to all content in a forum, you may wish to not allow guest access at all but rather provide free trials. Then via Pages (our CMS application) write your own marketing content which would entice (based on some sample content that you screenshot or copy into your marketing material) your guests to go sign up for a trial and that free or minimally priced trial will expire so you are not providing endless content to anyone forever. This option would not, however, allow you to post topics to social media directly because guests would need to login to read it but would allow you to promote the content via your marketing material.
	

	There are some third party add-ons out there (Please note, these would only be supported by their authors so you would want to contact them to verify their features and their support):



		That go a bit deeper with permissions and put them on the topics.
	
	
		Limit the number of topics a guest can view. While this may be enticing, I would not recommend this as if you intend to leverage guest viewing so that search engines can index your content. As this will impact you negatively.The only stock option I can think of: Pages blocks have the ability to ignore permissions. So, one could create topic/feed blocks to let guests see snippets from the closed areas.

Should I use Vagrant or Docker for creating an isolated environment?,"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 5 years ago. I use Ubuntu for development and deployment and have a need for creating an isolated environment. I am considering either Vagrant or Docker for this purpose. What are the pros and cons, or how do these solutions compare?Disclaimer: I wrote Vagrant! But because I wrote Vagrant, I spend most of my time living in the DevOps world which includes software like Docker. I work with a lot of companies using Vagrant and many use Docker, and I see how the two interplay.

Before I talk too much, a direct answer: in your specific scenario (yourself working alone, working on Linux, using Docker in production), you can stick with Docker alone and simplify things. In many other scenarios (I discuss further), it isn't so easy.

It isn't correct to directly compare Vagrant to Docker. In some scenarios, they do overlap, and in the vast majority, they don't. Actually, the more apt comparison would be Vagrant versus something like Boot2Docker (minimal OS that can run Docker). Vagrant is a level above Docker in terms of abstractions, so it isn't a fair comparison in most cases.

Vagrant launches things to run apps/services for the purpose of development. This can be on VirtualBox, VMware. It can be remote like AWS, OpenStack. Within those, if you use containers, Vagrant doesn't care, and embraces that: it can automatically install, pull down, build, and run Docker containers, for example. With Vagrant 1.6, Vagrant has docker-based development environments, and supports using Docker with the same workflow as Vagrant across Linux, Mac, and Windows. Vagrant doesn't try to replace Docker here, it embraces Docker practices.

Docker specifically runs Docker containers. If you're comparing directly to Vagrant: it is specifically a more specific (can only run Docker containers), less flexible (requires Linux or Linux host somewhere) solution. Of course if you're talking about production or CI, there is no comparison to Vagrant! Vagrant doesn't live in these environments, and so Docker should be used. 

If your organization runs only Docker containers for all their projects and only has developers running on Linux, then okay, Docker could definitely work for you! 

Otherwise, I don't see a benefit to attempting to use Docker alone, since you lose a lot of what Vagrant has to offer, which have real business/productivity benefits:


Vagrant can launch VirtualBox, VMware, AWS, OpenStack, etc. machines. It doesn't matter what you need, Vagrant can launch it. If you are using Docker, Vagrant can install Docker on any of these so you can use them for that purpose.
Vagrant is a single workflow for all your projects. Or to put another way, it is just one thing people have to learn to run a project whether it is in a Docker container or not. If, for example, in the future, a competitor arises to compete directly with Docker, Vagrant will be able to run that too. 
Vagrant works on Windows (back to XP), Mac (back to 10.5), and Linux (back to kernel 2.6). In all three cases, the workflow is the same. If you use Docker, Vagrant can launch a machine (VM or remote) that can run Docker on all three of these systems.
Vagrant knows how to configure some advanced or non-trivial things like networking and syncing folders. For example: Vagrant knows how to attach a static IP to a machine or forward ports, and the configuration is the same no matter what system you use (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.) For synced folders, Vagrant provides multiple mechanisms to get your local files over to the remote machine (VirtualBox shared folders, NFS, rsync, Samba [plugin], etc.). If you're using Docker, even Docker with a VM without Vagrant, you would have to manually do this or they would have to reinvent Vagrant in this case.
Vagrant 1.6 has first-class support for docker-based development environments. This will not launch a virtual machine on Linux, and will automatically launch a virtual machine on Mac and Windows. The end result is that working with Docker is uniform across all platforms, while Vagrant still handles the tedious details of things such as networking, synced folders, etc.


To address specific counter arguments that I've heard in favor of using Docker instead of Vagrant:


""It is less moving parts"" - Yes, it can be, if you use Docker exclusively for every project. Even then, it is sacrificing flexibility for Docker lock-in. If you ever decide to not use Docker for any project, past, present, or future, then you'll have more moving parts. If you had used Vagrant, you have that one moving part that supports the rest.
""It is faster!"" - Once you have the host that can run Linux containers, Docker is definitely faster at running a container than any virtual machine would be to launch. But launching a virtual machine (or remote machine) is a one-time cost. Over the course of the day, most Vagrant users never actually destroy their VM. It is a strange optimization for development environments. In production, where Docker really shines, I understand the need to quickly spin up/down containers.


I hope now its clear to see that it is very difficult, and I believe not correct, to compare Docker to Vagrant. For dev environments, Vagrant is more abstract, more general. Docker (and the various ways you can make it behave like Vagrant) is a specific use case of Vagrant, ignoring everything else Vagrant has to offer. 

In conclusion: in highly specific use cases, Docker is certainly a possible replacement for Vagrant. In most use cases, it is not. Vagrant doesn't hinder your usage of Docker; it actually does what it can to make that experience smoother. If you find this isn't true, I'm happy to take suggestions to improve things, since a goal of Vagrant is to work equally well with any system.

Hope this clears things up!I'm the author of Docker.

The short answer is that if you want to manage machines, you should use Vagrant. And if you want to build and run applications environments, you should use Docker.

Vagrant is a tool for managing virtual machines. Docker is a tool for building and deploying applications by packaging them into lightweight containers. A container can hold pretty much any software component along with its dependencies (executables, libraries, configuration files, etc.), and execute it in a guaranteed and repeatable runtime environment. This makes it very easy to build your app once and deploy it anywhere - on your laptop for testing, then on different servers for live deployment, etc.

It's a common misconception that you can only use Docker on Linux. That's incorrect; you can also install Docker on Mac, and Windows. When installed on Mac, Docker bundles a tiny Linux VM (25 MB on disk!) which acts as a wrapper for your container. Once installed this is completely transparent; you can use the Docker command-line in exactly the same way. This gives you the best of both worlds: you can test and develop your application using containers, which are very lightweight, easy to test and easy to move around (see for example https://hub.docker.com for sharing reusable containers with the Docker community), and you don't need to worry about the nitty-gritty details of managing virtual machines, which are just a means to an end anyway.

In theory it's possible to use Vagrant as an abstraction layer for Docker. I recommend against this for two reasons:


First, Vagrant is not a good abstraction for Docker. Vagrant was designed to manage virtual machines. Docker was designed to manage an application runtime. This means that Docker, by design, can interact with an application in richer ways, and has more information about the application runtime. The primitives in Docker are processes, log streams, environment variables, and network links between components. The primitives in Vagrant are machines, block devices, and ssh keys. Vagrant simply sits lower in the stack, and the only way it can interact with a container is by pretending it's just another kind of machine, that you can ""boot"" and ""log into"". So, sure, you can type ""vagrant up"" with a Docker plugin and something pretty will happen. Is it a substitute for the full breadth of what Docker can do? Try native Docker for a couple days and see for yourself :)
Second, the lock-in argument. ""If you use Vagrant as an abstraction, you will not be locked into Docker!"". From the point of view of Vagrant, which is designed to manage machines, this makes perfect sense: aren't containers just another kind of machine? Just like Amazon EC2 and VMware, we must be careful not to tie our provisioning tools to any particular vendor! This would create lock-in - better to abstract it all away with Vagrant. Except this misses the point of Docker entirely. Docker doesn't provision machines; it wraps your application in a lightweight portable runtime which can be dropped anywhere.


What runtime you choose for your application has nothing to do with how you provision your machines! For example it's pretty frequent to deploy applications to machines which are provisioned by someone else (for example an EC2 instance deployed by your system administrator, perhaps using Vagrant), or to bare metal machines which Vagrant can't provision at all. Conversely, you may use Vagrant to provision machines which have nothing to do with developing your application - for example a ready-to-use Windows IIS box or something. Or you may use Vagrant to provision machines for projects which don't use Docker - perhaps they use a combination of rubygems and rvm for dependency management and sandboxing for example.

In summary: Vagrant is for managing machines, and Docker is for building and running application environments.If your purpose is the isolation, I think Docker is what you want.

Vagrant is a virtual machine manager. It allows you to script the virtual machine configuration as well as the provisioning. However, it is still a virtual machine depending on VirtualBox (or others) with a huge overhead. It requires you to have a hard drive file that can be huge, it takes a lot of ram, and performance may be not very good.

Docker on the other hand uses kernel cgroup and namespacing via LXC. It means that you are using the same kernel as the host and the same file system.
You can use Dockerfile with the docker build command in order to handle the provisioning and configuration of your container. You have an example at docs.docker.com on how to make your Dockerfile; it is very intuitive.

The only reason you could want to use Vagrant is if you need to do BSD, Windows or other non-Linux development on your Ubuntu box. Otherwise, go for Docker.I preface my reply by admitting I have no experience with Docker, other than as an avid observer of what looks to be a really neat solution that's gaining a lot of traction.

I do have a decent amount of experience with Vagrant and can highly recommend it. It's certainly a more heavyweight solution in terms of it being VM based instead of LXC based. However, I've found a decent laptop (8 GB RAM, i5/i7 CPU) has no trouble running a VM using Vagrant/VirtualBox alongside development tooling.

One of the really great things with Vagrant is the integration with Puppet/Chef/shell scripts for automating configuration. If you're using one of these options to configure your production environment, you can create a development environment which is as close to identical as you're going to get, and this is exactly what you want.

The other great thing with Vagrant is that you can version your Vagrantfile along with your application code. This means that everyone else on your team can share this file and you're guaranteed that everyone is working with the same environment configuration.

Interestingly, Vagrant and Docker may actually be complimentary. Vagrant can be extended to support different virtualization providers, and it may be possible that Docker is one such provider which gets support in the near future. See https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/404 for recent discussion on the topic.They are very much complementary.

I have been using a combination of VirtualBox, Vagrant and Docker for all my projects for several months and have strongly felt the following benefits.

In Vagrant you can completely do away with any Chef solo provisioning and all you need your vagrant file to do is prepare a machine that runs a single small shell script that installs docker.  This means that my Vagrantfiles for every project are almost identical and very simple.

Here is a typical Vagrantfile

# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = ""2""
Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|

  config.vm.provision :shell, path: ""script/vagrant/docker_build"", :privileged => true
  # Start containers
  # config.vm.provision :shell, path: ""script/vagrant/docker_start"", :privileged => true
end


The Bootstrap file that installs docker looks like this

#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo 'vagrant  ALL= (ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers
apt-get update -y
apt-get install htop -y
apt-get install linux-image-extra-`uname -r` -y

echo deb http://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
apt-get update -y
apt-get install lxc-docker -y
apt-get install curl -y


Now to get all the services I need running I have a docker_start script that looks somthing like this

#!/bin/bash
cd /vagrant
echo Starting required service containers
export HOST_NAME=192.168.56.20
# Start MongoDB
docker run --name=mongodb --detach=true --publish=27017:27017 --publish=28017:28017 dockerfile/mongodb
read -t5 -n1 -r -p ""Waiting for mongodb to start..."" key
# Start rabbitmq
docker run --name=rabbitmq --detach=true --publish=5671:5671 --publish=5672:5672 --publish=55672:55672 --publish=15672:15672 --publish=15674:15674 --publish=61613:61613 --env RABBITMQ_USER=guest --env RABBITMQ_PASS=guest rabbitmq
read -t5 -n1 -r -p ""Waiting for rabbitmq to start..."" key
# Start cache
docker run --name=memcached --detach=true --publish=11211:11211  ehazlett/memcached
read -t5 -n1 -r -p ""Waiting for cache to start..."" key
# Start elasticsearch
docker run --name=elasticsearch --detach=true --publish=9200:9200 --publish=9300:9300 dockerfile/elasticsearch
read -t5 -n1 -r -p ""Waiting for elasticsearch to start..."" key
echo ""All services started""


In this example I am running MongoDB, Elastisearch, RabbitMQ and Memcached

A non-docker Chef solo configuration would be considerably more complicated.

A final big plus is gained when you are moving into production, translating the development environment over to an infrastructure of hosts that are all the same in that they just have enough config to run docker means very little work indeed.

If you interested I have a more detailed article on the development environment on my own web site at

Implementing A Vagrant / Docker Development EnvironmentVagrant-lxc is a plugin for Vagrant that let's you use LXC to provision Vagrant. It does not have all the features that the default vagrant VM (VirtualBox) has but it should allow you more flexibility than docker containers. There is a video in the link showing its capabilities that is worth watching.With Vagrant now you can have Docker as a provider. http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/docker/. Docker provider can be used instead of VirtualBox or VMware.

Please note that you can also use Docker for provisioning with Vagrant. This is very different than using Docker as a provider. http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/docker.html

This means you can replace Chef or Puppet with Docker. You can use combinations like Docker as provider (VM) with Chef as provisioner. Or you can use VirtualBox as provider and Docker as provisioner.Using both is an important part of application delivery testing. I am only beginning to get involved with Docker and thinking very hard about an application team that has terrible complexity in building and delivering its software.  Think of a classic Phoenix Project / Continuous Delivery situation.

The thinking goes something like this:


Take a Java/Go application component and build it as a container
(note, not sure if the app should be built in the container or built then
installed to the container) 
Deliver the container to a Vagrant VM.
Repeat this for all application components. 
Iterate on the component(s) to code against. 
Continuously test the delivery mechanism to the VM(s) managed by Vagrant
Sleep well knowing when it is time to deploy the container, that integration testing was occurring on a much more continuous basis than it was before Docker.


This seems to be the logical extension of Mitchell's statement that Vagrant is for development combined with Farley/Humbles thinking in Continuous Delivery. If I, as a developer, can shrink the feedback loop on integration testing and application delivery, higher quality and better work environments will follow.

The fact that as a developer I am constantly and consistently delivering containers to the VM and testing the application more holistically means that production releases will be further simplified. 

So I see Vagrant evolving as a way of leveraging some of the awesome consequences Docker will have for app deployment.Definitely Docker for the win!

As you may know Vagrant is for virtual machine management whereas Docker is for software containers management.
If you are not aware of the difference, here is:
A software container can share the same machine and kernel with other software containers. Using containers you save money because you don't waste resources on multiple operating systems (kernels), you can pack more software per server keeping a good degree of isolation.

Of course is a new discipline to care with its own pitfals and challenges.

Go for Docker Swarm if your requirements cross the single machine resources limit.There is a really informative article in the actual Oracle Java magazine about using Docker in combination with Vagrant (and Puppet):

Conclusion


  Docker’s lightweight containers are faster compared with classic VMs
  and have become popular among developers and as part of CD and DevOps
  initiatives. If your purpose is isolation, Docker is an excellent choice.
  Vagrant is a VM manager that enables you to script configurations of
  individual VMs as well as do the provisioning. However, it is sill a
  VM dependent on VirtualBox (or another VM manager) with relatively
  large overhead. It requires you to have a hard drive idle that can be
  huge, it takes a lot of RAM, and performance can be suboptimal. Docker
  uses kernel cgroups and namespace isolation via LXC. This means that
  you are using the same kernel as the host and the same ile system.
  Vagrant is a level above Docker in terms of abstraction, so they are
  not really comparable. Configuration management tools such as Puppet are
  widely used for provisioning target environments. Reusing existing
  Puppet-based solutions is easy with Docker. You can also slice your
  solution, so the infrastructure is provisioned with Puppet; the
  middleware, the business application itself, or both are provisioned
  with Docker; and Docker is wrapped by Vagrant. With this range of
  tools, you can do what’s best for your scenario.

Signs of Dying Software [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 5 years ago. What are signs that software is dying? How does a developer find early warnings to save a piece of software from dying? From user perspective, I think it is pretty clear - What they can not use efficiently, they will trash. Apart from this the software can die because of it's code - the architecture, coding style, size of codebase, codebase organization and quality of the programmers. I want to know how to listen to the signs of a software dying and take corrective actions. Any famous examples software being dead because no developer listened to the signs? Any examples of dying software being saved?Any of the following are clear indication that your system is on the endangered species list:


Single point of failure permitted to exist (only one person understands it)
Resources are not allocated by management to fix defects 
No active development for six months 
No release cycle in a year
Underlying vendor products/libraries go out of support 
Resources taken off a project and not replaced more than twice in a quarter
Environmental changes (higher volume of users for example) are not remediated
Performance is not measured and tuning does not regularly occur (performance degrades)
Infrastructure changes are looming (OS, DB, HARDWARE)
Users have created work arounds due to flaws, frustrations, or bugs in your system
Users base is falling


Ways to keep a project vital:


Engage your management openly and directly
Report defect rates accurately and quantify them in terms of cost to management
Automate as much of the build, test, packaging, and deployment cycles as you can
Modularize the system as much as possible
Have clear metrics in place and tune the applicaiton if necessary
Understand what your users find most critical and address those needs


On sofware libraries coming back from the dead I would have to give the first place ribbon to Objective-C.Insert cranky Windows joke here.

There are really several signs: 


increasing defect arrival rate
higher cost per defect repaired
higher cost per new feature


All of these suggest higher entropy in the code, ie, a low signal to noise ratio.

There are a number of ways to attack this; probably the most effective one is to identify modules that have high defect rates -- defects tend to have a Pareto distribution, ie, 20 percent of the modules account for 80 percent of the defects.  You build a test frame work for these modules, and re-implement them from a clean page, building good tests (using unit testing frameworks etc as appropriate) then fitting them back into the overall system.I believe that software dying from the internal ""technical reasons"" you seem to have in mind is relatively rare. I can't really think of any examples; maybe Delphi (though that's not dead, just badly ailing).

It seems far more common for software to be die because 


The underlying hardware or OS becomes obsolete and the software fails to make the transition (WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3)
A competing product offers superior features while the market leader stagnates due to complacency (Amiga)
The software becomes obsolete through ""paradigm changes"" (Encarta)


While the first two points are probably often partly the fault of quality problems (which make it too slow and costly to react to market changes), the latter isn't.Not fixing critical bugs soon. Say you ship a new version that has a bug affecting 10 % of users. If you don't fix it promptly and ship a fixed version these users will be unable to fully use the program and will search for a replacement. When you finally ship the delayed fixed version they are gone.When the developers are making excuses _NOT_ to touch or support the software.The only measure that counts is the one that derives from the ""user perspective"" you reference above.

The most likely candidates are:

1. Support request increases, and

2. Sales decreases.",,,,,1,665,78.81,29.24,36.65,32.77,31.67,25.71,80.75,62.71,47.37,7.37,3.31,0.75,0,1.65,0,0.9,4.06,14.74,7.82,2.41,12.33,6.47,4.66,5.41,2.26,13.38,7.52,6.17,3.01,0,1.65,1.65,14.74,1.2,13.38,2.71,3.01,1.05,3.46,0.6,3.61,0,3.31,2.11,1.2,0.75,0.15,0.6,0.15,0.3,0,0,5.41,2.41,0.45,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.75,3.01,0,0,0,0,2.41,0.15,0,2.26,5.86,0.15,0.15,4.51,1.2,0,1.8,0.3,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,1.5,1.05,0.3,0.3,0,0.15,0,0,0.45,0.45,4.81,7.52,0.9,1.2,4.81,0,0.75,0.15,4.21,0.9,5.41,1.05,0,0,0,0,0,14.74,3.31,3.31,0.75,0,0.75,6.62,

Simulator or Emulator? What is the difference?,"While I understand what simulation and emulation mean in general, I almost always get confused about them. Assume that I create a piece of software that mimics existing hardware/software, what should I call it? A simulator or an emulator? Could anyone explain the difference in terms of programming? Bonus: What is the difference in English between these two terms? (Sorry, I am not a native speaker :))Emulation is the process of mimicking the outwardly observable behavior to match an existing target.  The internal state of the emulation mechanism does not have to accurately reflect the internal state of the target which it is emulating.
Simulation, on the other hand, involves modeling the underlying state of the target.  The end result of a good simulation is that the simulation model will emulate the target which it is simulating.
Ideally, you should be able to look into the simulation and observe properties that you would also see if you looked into the original target.  In practice, there may some shortcuts to the simulation for performance reasons -- that is, some internal aspects of the simulation may actually be an emulation.
MAME is an arcade game emulator; Hyperterm is a (not very good) terminal emulator.  There's no need to model the arcade machine or a terminal in detail to get the desired emulated behavior.
Flight Simulator is a simulator; SPICE is an electronics simulator.  They model as much as possible every detail of the target to represent what the target does in reality.
EDIT: Other responses have pointed out that the goal of an emulation is to able to substitute for the object it is emulating.  That's an important point.  A simulation's focus is more on the modeling of the internal state of the target -- and the simulation does not necessarily lead to emulation.  In particular, a simulation may run far slower than real-time.  SPICE, for example, cannot substitute for an actual electronics circuit (even if assuming there was some kind of magical device that perfectly interfaces electrical circuits to a SPICE simulation.)
A simulation does not always lead to emulation --If a flight-simulator could transport you from A to B then it would be a flight-emulator.

An emulator can replace the original for real use.

A Virtual PC emulates a PC.  

A simulator is a model for study and analysis.  

An emulator will always have to operate close to real-time. For a simulator that is not always the case. A geological simulation could do 1000 years/second or more.Simulation = For analysis and study

Emulation = For usage as a substitute

A simulator is an environment which models but an emulator is one that replicates the usage as on the original device or system.

Simulator mimics the activity of something that it is simulating. It ""appears""(a lot can go with this ""appears"", depending on the context) to be the same as the thing being simulated. For example the flight simulator ""appears"" to be a real flight to the user, although it does not transport you from one place to another. 

Emulator, on the other hand, actually ""does"" what the thing being emulated does, and in doing so it too ""appears to be doing the same thing"". An emulator may use different set of protocols for mimicking the thing being emulated, but the result/outcome is always the same as the original object. For example, EMU8086 emulates the 8086 microprocessor on your computer, which obviously is not running on 8086 (= different protocols), but the output it gives is what a real 8086 would give.It's a difference in focus. Emulators1 focus on recreating the behavior of a system, with no regard for how the system functions internally. Simulators2 focus on modeling the components of a system. You use an emulator when you care mostly about what a system does, and a simulator when you care about how it does it.

As for their general English meanings, emulation is ""the endeavor to equal or to excel another in qualities or actions"", while simulation is ""to model, replicate, duplicate the behavior, appearance or properties of"". Not much difference. Emulation comes from æmulus, ""striving, rivaling,"" and is related to ""imitate"" and ""image,"" which suggests a surface-lever resemblance. ""Simulation"" comes from similis ""like"", as does the word ""similar,"" which perhaps suggests a deeper congruence.

Wikipedia: Emulator
Wikipedia: Computer Simulation
Wiktionary: emulation
Wiktionary: simulation
Etymology Online: emulation
Etymology Online: simulationI don't think emulator and simulator can be compared. Both mimic something, but are not part of the same scope of reasonning, they are not used in the same context.

In short: an emulator is designed to copy some features of the orginial and can even replace it in the real environment. A simulator is not desgined to copy the features of the original, but only to appear similar to the original to human beings. Without the features of the orginal, the simulator cannot replace it in the real environment.

An emulator is a device that mimics something close enough so that it can be substituted to the real thing. E.g you want a circuit to work like a ROM (read only memory) circuit, but also wants to adjust the content until it is what you want. You'll use a ROM emulator, a black box (likely to be CPU-based) with a physical and electrical interfaces compatible with the ROM you want to emulate. The emulator will be plugged into the device in place of the real ROM. The motherboard will not see any difference when working, but you will be able to change the emulated-ROM content easily. Said otherwise the emulator will act exactly as the actual thing in its motherboard context (maybe a little bit slower due to actual internal model) but there will be additional functions (like re-writing) visible only to the designer, out of the motherboard context. So emulator definition would be: something that mimic the original, has all of its functional features, can actually replace it to some extend in the real world, and may have additional features not visible in the normal context.

A simulator is used in another thinking context, e.g a plane simulator, a car simulator, etc. The simulation will take care only of some aspect of the actual thing, usually those related to how a human being will perceive and control it. The simulator will not perform the functions of the real stuff, and cannot be sustituted to it. The plane simulator will not fly or carry someone, it's not its purpose at all. The simulator is not intended to work, but to appear to the pilot somehow like the actual thing for purposes other than its normal ones, e.g. to allow ground training (including in unusual situations like all-engine failure). So simulator definition would be: something that can appear to human, to some extend, like the original, but cannot replace it for actual use. In addition the pilot will know that the simulator is a simulator.

I don't think we'll see any ROM simulator, because ROM are not interacting with human beings, nor we'll see any plane emulator, because planes cannot have a replacement performing the same functions in the real world. 

In my view the model inside an emulator or a simulator can be anything, and has not to be similar to the model of the original. A ROM emulator model will likely be software instead of hardware, MS Flight Simulator cannot be more software than it is.

This comparison of both terms will contradict the currently selected answer (from Toybuilder) which puts the difference on the internal model, while my suggestion is that the difference is whether the fake can or cannot be used to perform the actual function in the actual world (to some accepted extend, indeed).

Note that the plane simulator will have also to simulate the earth, the sun, the wind, etc, which are not part of the plane, so a plane simulator will have to mimic some aspects of the plane, as well as the environment of the plane because it is not used in this actual environment, but in a training room. 

This is a big difference with the emulator which emulates only the orginal, and its purpose is to be used in the environment of the original with no need to emulate it. Back to the plane context... what could be a plane emulator? Maybe a train that will connect two airports -- actually two plane steps -- carrying passengers, with stewardesses onboard, with car interior looking like an actual plane cabin, and with captain saying ""ladies and gentlemen our altitude is currenlty 10 kms and the temperature at our destination is 24°C"". Its benefit is difficult to see, hum...

As a conclusion, the emulator is a real thing intended to work, the simulator is a fake intended to trick the user.To understand the difference between a simulator and an emulator, keep in mind that a simulator tries to mimic the behavior of a real device. For example, in the case of the iOS Simulator, it simulates the real behavior of an actual iPhone/iPad device. However, the Simulator itself uses the various libraries installed on the Mac (such as QuickTime) to perform its rendering so that the effect looks the same as an actual iPhone. In addition, applications tested on the Simulator are compiled into x86 code, which is the byte-code understood by the Simulator. A real iPhone device, conversely, uses ARM-based code.

In contrast, an emulator emulates the working of a real device. Applications tested on an emulator are compiled into the actual byte-code used by the real device. The emulator executes the application by translating the byte-code into a form that can be executed by the host computer running the emulator.

To understand the subtle difference between simulation and emulation, imagine you are trying to convince a child that playing with knives is dangerous. To simulate this, you pretend to cut yourself with a knife and groan in pain. To emulate this, you actually cut yourself.In more or less normal parlance: If your software can do everything the mimicked system can do, it's an emulator. If it only approximates the results of a system (IT or otherwise), it's a simulator.An emulator is a model of a system which will accept any valid input that that the emulated system would accept, and produce the same output or result. So your software is an emulator, only if it reproduces the behavior of the emulated system precisely.Some years ago I came up with a very short adage that, I believe, captures the essence of the difference quite nicely:


  A simulator is an emulator on a mission.


By that I mean that you use an emulator when you can't use the real thing, and you use a simulator when you can't use the real thing and you want to find something out about it.Simple Explanation.

If you want to convert your PC (running Windows) into Mac, you can do either of these:


  (1) You can simply install a Mac theme on your Windows. So, your PC feels more like Mac, but you can't actually run any Mac programs. (SIMULATION)


(or)


  (2) You can program your PC to run like Mac (I'm not sure if this is possible :P ). Now you can even run Mac programs successfully and expect the same output as on Mac. (EMULATION)


In the first case, you can experience Mac, but you can't expect the same output as on Mac. 

In the second case, you can expect the same output as on Mac, but still the fact remains that it is only a PC.Simulator: it is similar to interpreter.
i.e. it actually executes the real code in line by line to mimic the behaviour

Emulator: it is similar executable.
i.e. it takes compiled code and executes it.The distintion between the two terms is a bit fuzzy.  Coming from a world where ""Emulators"" are pieces of hardware that allow you debug embedded systems.  And remember products that allowed you to have ICE (In Circuit Emulation) capabilities to debug a PC platform, I find the use of the term ""Emulation"" to be a somewhat of a misnomer for software that SIMULATES the behaviour of a piece of hardware.

My justification for the current use of the term is Emulation is that it may ""augment"" the functionality, and only is concerned with a ""reasonable"" approximation of the behaviour of the system.  

ICE: (In Circuit Emulation)
A piece of hardware that is plugged into a board in place of the actual processor.  It allows you to run the system as if the actual processor was present.  Typically these have a variant of the processor on them to actually execute the software with glue logic to allow the user to break executation and single step under hardware control.  Some would also provide logging capability.  Most modern processors development systems have replace ICE type emulation with JTAG Emulation, where the JTAG just talks to the processor via a special purpose serial link and all execution is perform by the processor mounted on the board.

Software EMULATOR:
An 0x86 emulator is only concerned with being able to execute 0x86 assembly language, not providing accurate cycle per cycle behaviourial model of a SPECIFIC 0x86 processor.  Bochs is an example of this.  QEMU does this, but also allows ""virtualization"" using special kernel modules.

SIMULATOR:
Texas Instruments provides a CYCLE ACCURATE behaviourial model of there processors for software development that is intended to be a accurate SIMULATION of SPECIFIC processor cores behavior for the developers to use prior to having working hardware.

Software EMULATOR augmenting functionality:
BLEEM not only allowed you to run Playstation Software, but also allowed the display to be output with higher resolution than the Playstation was able to provide, and also took advantage of more advanced capabilities of GPUs that were avaliable.  (i.e. Better blending and smoothing of textures.)An emulator is an alternative to the real system but a simulator is used to optimize, understand and estimate the real system.A simulation is a system that behaves similar to something else, but is implemented in an entirely different way. It provides the basic behavior of a system but may not necessarily abide by all of the rules of the system being simulated. It is there to give you an idea about how something works.

An emulation is a system that behaves exactly like something else, and abides by all of the rules of the system being emulated. It is effectively a complete replication of another system, right down to being binary compatible with the emulated system's inputs and outputs, but operating in a different environment to the environment of the original emulated system. The rules are fixed, and cannot be changed or the system fails.Both terms are something completely different and only intersect very little.  To find the right term is actually very easy, just think about following:
A simulation does not do anything for real.  You can study it, for example how computer work, but it usually has no outcome other than that.    A plane crash in a Flight Simulator causes no real harm.  A weather forecast simulation itself does not change the weather.
An emulation does something for real.  You can work with an emulated computer like with a physical one and create documents with it.  And a plane crash in a Flight Emulator would have an outcome, like people experiencing the real impact including possible physical harm.
Your confusion probably stems from the fact, that ""studying the simulation"" and ""accessing the emulation"" often is quite the same thing.
You are not alone with your confusion.  The Film ""Matrix"" speaks of a simulation.  However The Matrix is running an emulation, as it has real impact on all members of The Matrix.  In contrast the training room has no real impact, so this is a simulation (of The Matrix).
Let's see some examples.
Simulated vs. Emulated Rain
Take a water hose in the garden and let it rain.  What's the difference between simulation and emulation here?
When you are simulating rain, people still will blame you for getting wet.  Your rain has some real impact on the world, but your simulation hasn't, as the simulation does not fool anybody in that it is real rain.
In contrast, when you are emulating rain, people would blame the weather.  This is, your emulated rain really behaves like rain in reality.
This rain emulation hence distorts reality,
in making people belie in the wrong culprit.

It took me quite some time to understand that.
Hence it isn't easy nor obvious which explains all the confusion.

Keep in mind that a simulation can have sideeffects,
like the weather forecast is based on simulations,
which takes quite some computing power and thus electrical energy,
which has an environmental impact.
Hence in the example of ""simulated rain"", people getting wet just is a sideffect and not part of the simulation.  Same is true if you simulate a rainbow with this simulated rain.  While the property of ""how rainbows work"" is part of this simulation, the simulation itself is not providing the rainbow, this just happens due to refraction of the sun on the sideffect of the waterdrops.
Simulated vs. Emulated Computer
While you might think ""a simulated computer can have an outcome"" this is practically wrong reasoning.  If you save files onto a simulated harddrive, these files cannot leave the simulated drive outside of the simulation.  You can obtain the files by studying the simulated drive, but this is not part of the simulation itself.
In case the harddrive saves the data such, that the data is actually usable outside of the simulation, you have an emulated harddrive within the simulation to do so.
So an emulation can be part of a simulation and vice versa.
Simulated vs. Emulated Filesystem
If you simulate a filesystem, you probably, for practicability, will choose to save the files onto your real filesystem as-is (perhaps with some additional meta-information).  In that case the simulation seems to create real ""value"" outside of the simulation:  Usable files!
But this is just by coincidence, because your simulated filesystem actually emulates a filesystem as well.  You actually emulated the outside filesystem inside your simulation!
Simulated vs. Emulated TPM or HSM
A good example of the difference is, when you think of security.  A TPM is a specific device to keep it's own keys secure (source of identity) while an HSM is a general device to secure foreign keys (verify identity).

Fun Fact:  My fingers constantly type TMP instead of TPM.

If you simulate a TPM this has a huge effect on security, because then you can observe the internal states of the TPM.  Which renders all the security void.  Even that such a simulation can give you valuable hints of improving the design of a TPM itself, you won't want to expose precious data to the simulated TPM for real.
However if you emulate a TPM you will try to hide these internal states to the outside as good as you can.  Such an emulated TPM then can be possibly used to really secure something else better than without it.
With a real TPM you cannot emulate the properties of a real HSM.  All you can archive is to simulate an HSM, but this will not have the security properties of a real HSM, so all data which is stored in this simulated HSM will not be protected (they will only be protected within the simulation itself).
In contrast, with a real HSM you can emulate a TPM with all properties of a real TPM.  For this the HSM needs to be constructed such, that no information needs to leave the HSM which does not leave a TPM as well.
(Please note that I do not know anything about HSMs or TPMs in particular, so it might be that there are no HSMs out there which are able to provide emulated TPMs.)
Simulated vs. Emulated World
If our world is simulated, we are simulations, too.  Hence some spectator (let's call her God) can look at us and change the simulation any time.  Also we cannot find out if we are simulated or not.  As I am pretty sure that I know that I am, I do not think I am simulated, because self-awareness looks like an effect with a real component to me, which contradicts simulation.  This also means, our world cannot be a simulation, too, as a simulation can only affect me like the world does, if I am part of the simulation.
But our world still can be emulated (like in the Film ""Matrix""), as all I have to ""prove the world"" is my state of mind and sensory input, which I cannot verify, as I cannot leave myself.  If I am not part of the emulation, then there should be a chance to observe discontinuity (like in the film ""Matrix""), in case the emulation does not work flawlessly.
This changes when I emulated, too, like running an OS in an emulator.  Then I cannot observe such errors, as my state can be reset from within the emulation (call it: Sleep) without observable discontinuation.
However I rather think that the world is a holographic hallucination than something like an emulation.  Because if it is emulated, then I am pwned by somebody (call him Rick) who is running the emulation for some purpose, while a hallucination is purely my own thing.
I stop here, because hallucinations lead us to something completely different.This question is probably best answered by taking a look at historical practice.

In the past, I've seen gaming console emulators on PC for the PlayStation & SEGA.

Simulators are commonplace when referring to software that tries to mimic real life actions, such as driving or flying. Gran Turismo and Microsoft Flight Simulator spring to mind as classic examples of simulators.

As for the linguistic difference, emulation usually refers to the action of copying someone's (or something's) praiseworthy characteristics or behaviors. Emulation is distinct from imitation, in which a person is copied for the purpose of mockery.

The linguistic meaning of the verb 'simulation' is essentially to pretend or mimic someone or something.In computer science both a simulation and emulation produce the same outputs, from the same inputs, that the original system does; However, an emulation also uses the same processes to achieve it and is made out of the same materials. A simulation uses different processes from the original system.  Also worth noting is the term replication, which is the intermediate of the two - using the same processes but being made out of a different material.

So if I want to run my old Super Mario Bros game on my PC I use an SNES emulator, because it is using the same or similar computer code (processes) to run the game, and uses the same or similar materials (silicon chip).
However, if I want to fly a Boeing 747 jet on my PC I use a flight simulator because it uses completely different processes from the original (there are no actual wings, lift or aerodynamics involved!).

Here are the exact definitions taken from a computer science glossary:

A simulation is a model of a system that captures the functional connections between inputs and outputs of the system, but without necessarily being based on processes that are the same as, or similar to, those of the system itself.

A replication is a model of a system that captures the functional connections between inputs and outputs of the system and is based on processes that are the same as, or similar to, those of the system itself.

An emulation is a model of some system that captures the functional connections between inputs and outputs of the system, based on processes that are the same as, or similar to, those of that system, and that is built of the same materials as that system.

Reference: The Open University, M366 Glossary 1.1, 2007Both are models of an object that you have some means of controlling inputs to and observing outputs from.

The key difference is that:


With an emulator, you want the output exactly match what the object you are emulating would produce.
With a simulator, you want certain properties of your output to be similar to what the object would produce.


Let me give an example -- suppose you want to do some system testing to see how adding a new sensor (like a thermometer) to a system would affect the system. You know that the thermometer sends a message 8 time a second containing its measurement.

Simulation -- if you do not have the thermometer yet, but you want to test that this message rate will not overload you system, you can simulate the sensor by attaching a unit that sends a random number 8 times a second. You can run any test that does not rely on the actual value the sensor sends.

Emulation -- suppose you have a very expensive thermometer that measures to 0.001 C, and you want to see if you can get by with a cheaper thermometer that only measures to the nearest 0.5 C. You can emulate the cheaper thermometer using an expensive thermometer and then rounding the reading to the nearest 0.5 C and running tests that rely on the temperature values.

Note that simulations can also be used for forecasting or predicting behavior. Finite element analysis simulations are used in many applications, including weather prediction and virtual wind tunnels.

The definitions of the terms:


emulation -- surpass or exactly match
simulate -- imitate in appearance or characterThe definitions of the words describe the difference the best. A google search gives the following definitions of simulate and emulate:

simulate imitate the appearance or character of.

emulate match or surpass (a person or achievement), typically by imitation.

A simulation imitates a system. An emulation simulates a system so well that it could replace it or may even surpass it.

In computing, an emulation would be a drop in replacement for the system it is emulating. Often times it will even outperform the system it is imitating. For example, game console emulators usually make improvements such as greater hardware compatibility, better performance, and improved audio/video quality.

Simulations, on the other hand, are limited by them being models. They are a best attempt to mimic a system, but not replacements for it. There are hardware emulators because hardware can be imitated and it would be hard to tell the difference. There is no Farming Emulator because there is no emulation that could replace actual farming. We can only simulate a model of farming to gain insight on how to farm better.A Virtual PC tries to emulate a Computer, from the point of view of a Programmer BUT, at the same time, it simulates a Computer from the point of view of a Electrical Engineer.Simulator is something more broader than Emulator and it seems like the duality of this terms is overthought in the posts above.

Emulator

People decided to use a new word emulation in the ""computer world"" when they started replacing some hardware parts of the existing system in straightforward manner - imitating their behaviour and relying on the computational nature to be sure to not break something and leave everything in the equivalent state. So we have emulated the piece of this! (and the whole still works as before)

Emulator usually used in narrow sense in digital area as replacement and virtualization - presenting in digital form as a piece of software - of something known and existed before (virtual chips, circuit boards, electronic devices). So when the world became more digital and brought the emulator word to the masses,  the masses added uncertainty to it (or additional reasons).

Simulator

First of all, I saw many comments about emulators do or replace something real but simulators not.

BUT flight simulator is used for a real thing - it trains pilots, gives them skill up and knowledge and it replaces expensive real planes and saves much of money. And we cannot just say a plane-emulator because we have inner feeling that this is much more than that, so we call it simulator :) Plane simulator could contain emulated radar or transponder that is true.

Contra-statements that simulators are used for analysis and study (and emulators for something real), but that analysis and study not less a real thing than emulated GSM boards (even more in the informational age we live in). Analysis adds a value to the business, cuts costs or points out to profits not less than the replaced (emulated) hardware.

Simulator is similar to modelling of something that we can't obtain for some reason (cost, technology, physical impossibility). It is usually simulated for something new or intangible or complex or not properly known to us like market, weather, combustion, user. So here comes the flight, black hole, stock exchange, simulations.

So finally:  


Simulator is broader than Emulator   
Simulator tends to imitate/model more global processes/things in general with ability to narrow the imitation down (e.g. capacitor simulator with presets representing some known models)    
Emulator tends to imitate certain hardware devices with certain specification, known characteristics and properties (e.g. SNES emulator, Intel 8087 or Roland TB-303)


As for words origin

All came from Latin and mean:  


emulate is ""to be equal"" (looks like more aggressive and straightforward - rivalry)  
simulate is ""to be similar"" (looks like more sly and tricky - imitation)Emulator:

Consider a situation that you know only English and you are in China. In order to interact with a Chinese person you need a translator. Now, role of translator is that it will seek input from you in English and convert to Chinese and and give that input to the Chinese person and gets response from the Chinese person and convert to English and give the output to you in English. Now that translator and Chinese person is the emulator. Both combine will provide similar functionality as if you were communicating with the English person. So hardware may be different but functionality will be same.

Simulator:

I can't give better example than SPICE or flight simulator. Both will replace hardware component behavior with the software or mathematical model which will behave similar to the hardware.

In the end it depends on the context that which solution better suits project needs.Emulation is like
Abstruction.
It shows what it can do.
Example: Car driving emulation.
Simulation is like
Encaptulation.
It shows how it can do
Example: Car engine inner activity.The simulator is necessarily a scale model.

Six sigma quality management and software development [closed],"Is it possible to use Six Sigma Quality Management with Software Development Processes?

What's your experience on that?

If you're using an Agile method like Scrum or XP, isn't Six Sigma too bureaucratic?

I'm talking about quality management on software development as a whole, since requirements gathering until deployoment and operations, and not only the construction phase (which tools like TDD and unit testing are more or less already established as best practices).Six Sigma works well with reproducible processes. By that, I mean pure process that consistently produces (or is supposed to produce) the same output. Given that software development rarely produces the same output, SS is not really applicable, IMO. This is because software development is more a practice than a process.

That being said, it doesn't hurt to read about it and try to see what top-level ideas can be put into software development...If I understand it correctly, six sigma depends on having meaningful, measurable metrics.  What will yours be?   KLOC?  Classes checked into your archive?  Agile velocity?

Six sigma works great on shop floors, but I don't believe that software development is sufficiently ""widget-like"" to lend itself to such an approach.It is definitely possible as long as you aren't developing a new product. 

Just follow these steps.

1) Create a bug free version of the application. This may take a considerable amount of effort thus it is best to select an application that is trivial in scope.

2) Recreate the application from scratch and compare the iteration to the ideal created in step 1 to create a metric.

3) Tweak your process to acheive closer alignment next to the metric on the next iteration.

4) Go to step 2.

What? You don't create the same application over and over in your shop? Hmm, I don't think six sigma is going to be much use in that scenario.For Six Sigma to be useful you need easily comparable metrics or procedures. 

Software is too abstract to have the type of metrics needed.

Maybe a good question to ask would be 


  Is there a quality control tool for software development similar to Six Sigma for the production and manufacturing world?I've used a wide range of methodologies, Six Sigma, Agile etc.  Really the success of quality management on software development is dependent on one key thing.  The quailty of the team.  It all boils down to that.  A good team can work within a horrible methodology and make it work.  That's why they are good.  Process is important, and you can make a bad process more efficient, but it's all dependent on the team.Six Sigma can be a good fit for maintenance teams that have a big backlog of discrete work items.

Design for Six Sigma has some elements that can be applied to building a new software product.

And since most software is an enabler to a business process, and that business process may be a highly repeated process where the statistics tools of six sigma can be applied, six sigma can have a role in determining what the highest value software feature is to deliver maximal business value.  It can take the emotion out of the decision making process for feature prioritization.  If you have an environment where the product manager/stakeholder who yells loudest or most eloquently got their stuff built, six sigma can be applied to fix that unhealthy aspect of your development process by putting some rational measurement behind the prioritization process.There are parts of software development that don't fit well, as they do not provide a process with a normal distribution of results. On the other hand, the focus on risk, value and doing the right things is essential 

[edit] Take a look at the Cynefin model (on wikipedia) to understand why large parts of software development are in the complex domain.I am not sure to follow you.

SixSigma is a is a methodology to manage process variations that uses data and statistical analysis to measure and improve a company's operational performance.

So take any process (SDP or other), choose what you want to measure, identify the issues, plan the solutions, evaluate the impacts.

The SixSigma projects I have participated were all fairly transversal and not linked to a software life cycle.



By transversal, I mean transversal to the ""product design-development-construction-delivery"" process that is software development.

For example, in an environment were we need to produce a set of programs running on our internal production platform, most of our SixSigma projects are centered around Operational Architecture, that is ""making operational an execution environment"" (how to set up servers and networks in order to stop, update, install and launch a set of executables, and that for many projects each with their own SDP).

That is a notion transversal to any SDP you want, since in the end, all those ""Development Processes"" have but one goal in common: put your software into production.

The criteria to measure were precise and reproducible, going from the time to manage the merges needed to consolidate a final executable to the number of merge errors to the deployment errors (because of an incorrect labels or a faulty release notes).

All those missteps were noted release after release, and the goal was to reduce them.

One side-effect was to identify an inadequate merge workflow, workflow which, once fixed, allowed us to greatly reduce the errors in the final set of deliveries.I had a professor in a class that taught six sigma and other manufacturing efficiency techniques, and after telling him I was in the software development field he suggested the book Lean Software Development.  Unforunately I haven't read it, but it seems to deal with applying some of the applicable concepts of six sigma and lean manufacturing to producing software (like eliminating waste, reducing defects, continuous improvement).  Here's a short white paper describing lean software development.I have used Six Sigma for specific performance testing projects which begin with a specific measurable problem statement and end with a counter measure that is again measurable.

Software Automation tool,"At my company, we have to fill out a daily timecard, and I want to automate it.
I want to use some sort of tool that will allow me to write something like this: It would be really nice if the software solution will also execute itself daily at a given time.Since you are asking about UI automation you might want to check out AutoHotKey.

It's a macro language and you can compile the code into executable binaries (.exe).

However, sending web request could be done better without a browser by sending the necessary HTTP requests. Such an approach is more light-weight, more flexible and probably easier to maintain as well.Check out the Chickenfoot extension for Firefox.  I believe it may help you a long the way.


  Chickenfoot is a Firefox extension that puts a programming environment in the browser's sidebar so you can write scripts to manipulate web pages and automate web browsing.


It also provides a basic record feature, and you can then fine-tune the interactiosn with the web page(s).If all you need to automatize is related to browsers, then you may try out Selenium Remote Control which provides libraries in different languages.

For browser automation, there are a couple more experimental libraries in javascript (you should search for web app testing tools as these are imo your best bet for now)

./alexFor decision making, you might have to write some code.  

iMacros for firefox has the ability to record/playback.I have not used it myself but I have heard good things about Selenium. This is a Web UI testing tool that can be scripted in a number of different languages.I would try to accomplish this with twill.If by ""some sort of tool"" do you mean something like a programming language or environment that will allow you to automate what FireFox does? If so, I recommend learning how to write a FireFox extension. Extensions are written in Javascript.  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions

Software Design vs. Software Architecture [closed],"Could someone explain the difference between Software Design and Software Architecture? More specifically; if you tell someone to present you the 'design' - what would you expect them to present? Same goes for 'architecture'. My current understanding is: Correct me if I'm wrong. I have referred Wikipedia has articles on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture, but I'm not sure if I have understood them correctly.You're right yes. The architecture of a system is its 'skeleton'. It's the highest level of abstraction of a system. What kind of data storage is present, how do modules interact with each other, what recovery systems are in place. Just like design patterns, there are architectural patterns: MVC, 3-tier layered design, etc. 

Software design is about designing the individual modules / components. What are the responsibilities, functions, of module x? Of class Y? What can it do, and what not? What design patterns can be used?

So in short, Software architecture is more about the design of the entire system, while software design emphasizes on module / component / class level.In some descriptions of the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) they are interchangeable, but the consesus is that they are distinct.  They are at the same time:  different (1) stages, (2) areas of responsibility, and (3) levels of decision-making. 


Architecture is the bigger picture: the choice of frameworks, languages, scope, goals, and high-level methodologies (Rational, waterfall, agile, etc.).
Design is the smaller picture:  the plan for how code will be organized; how the contracts between different parts of the system will look; the ongoing implementation of the project's methodologies and goals.  Specification are written during this stage.


These two stages will seem to blend together for different reasons.  


Smaller projects often don't have enough scope to separate out planning into these to stages.
A project might be a part of a larger project, and hence parts of both stages are already decided.  (There are already existing databases, conventions, standards, protocols, frameworks, reusable code, etc.)
Newer ways of thinking about the SDLC (see Agile methodologies) somewhat rearrange this traditional approach.  Design (architecture to a lesser extent) takes place throughout the SDLC on purpose.  There are often more iterations where the whole process happens over and over.
Software development is complicated and difficult to plan anyway, but clients/managers/salespeople usually make it harder by changing goals and requirements mid-stream.  Design and even architectural decisions must bemade later in the project whether that is the plan or not.


Even if the stages or areas of responsibility blend together and happen all over the place, it is always good to know what level of decision-making is happening.  (We could go on forever with this.  I'm trying to keep it a summary.)  I'll end with:  Even if it seems your project has no formal architectural or design stage/AOR/documentaiton, it IS happening whether anyone is consciously doing it or not.  If no one decides to do architecture, then a default one happens that is probably poor.  Ditto for design.  These concepts are almost more important if there are no formal stages representing them.Architecture is strategic, while Design is tactical.

Architecture comprises the frameworks, tools, programming paradigms, component-based software engineering standards, high-level principles.. 

While design is an activity concerned with local constraints, such as design patterns, programming idioms, and refactorings.I found this as I was looking for simple distinction between architecture and design myself;

What do you think of this way of looking at them:  


architecture is ""what"" we're building;
design is ""how"" we're building;Architecture means the conceptual structure and logical organization of a computer or computer-based system.
Design means a plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings of a system or an object before it is made.

If you are “architecting” a component, you are defining how it behaves in the larger system.
If you are “designing” the same component, you are defining how it behaves internally.



All architecture is design but NOT all design is architecture.

What part is the Design, the How is the concrete implementation and the intersection of What and How is Architecture.
Image for differentiating Architecture and Design:

There are also design decisions, that are not architecturally significant, i.e. does not belongs to the architecture branch of design. For example, some component’s internal design decisions, like- choice of algorithm, selection of data structure etc.
Any design decision, which isn’t visible outside of its component boundary is a component’s internal design and is non-architectural. These are the design decisions a system architect would leave on module designer’s discretion or the implementation team as long as their design don’t break the architectural constraints imposed by the system level architecture.
The link that gives good analogyI'd say you are right, in my own words;

Architecture is the allocation of system requirements to system elements. Four statements about an architecture:


It can introduce non-functional requirements like language or patterns.
It defines the interaction between components, interfaces, timing, etc.
It shall not introduce new functionality, 
It allocates the (designed) functions that the system is intended to perform to elements. 


Architecture is an essential engineering step when a complexity of the system is subdivided. 

Example: Think about your house, you don't need an architect for your kitchen (only one element involved) but the complete building needs some interaction definitions, like doors, and a roof.

Design is a informative representation of the (proposed) implementation of the function. It is intended to elicit feedback and to discuss with stakeholders. It might be good practice but is not an essential engineering step. 

It would be nice to see the kitchen design see before the kitchen is installed but it is not essential for the cooking requirement:

If I think about it you can state:


architecture is for a public/engineers on a more detailed abstraction level
design is intended for public on a less detailed abstraction levelMy reminder:  


We can change the Design without asking someone
If we change the Architecture we need to communicate it to someone (team, client, stakeholder, ...)I think we should use the following rule to determine when we talk about Design vs Architecture: If the elements of a software picture you created can be mapped one to one to a programming language syntactical construction, then is Design, if not is Architecture.

So, for example, if you are seeing a class diagram or a sequence diagram, you are able to map a class and their relationships to an Object Oriented Programming language using the Class syntactical construction. This is clearly Design. In addition, this might bring to the table that this discussion has a relation with the programming language you will use to implement a software system. If you use Java, the previous example applies, as Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language. If you come up with a diagram that shows packages and its dependencies, that is Design too. You can map the element (a package in this case) to a Java syntactical construction.

Now, suppose your Java application is divided in modules, and each module is a set of packages (represented as a jar file deployment unit), and you are presented with a diagram containing modules and its dependencies, then, that is Architecture. There isn’t a way in Java (at least not until Java 7) to map a module (a set of packages) to a syntactical construction. You might also notice that this diagram represents a step higher in the level of abstraction of your software model. Any diagram above (coarse grained than) a package diagram, represents an Architectural view when developing in the Java programming language. On the other hand, if you are developing in Modula-2, then, a module diagram represents a Design.

(A fragment from http://www.copypasteisforword.com/notes/software-architecture-vs-software-design)Personally, I like this one:   

""The designer is concerned with what happens when a user presses a button, and the architect is concerned with what happens when ten thousand users press a button."" 

SCEA for Java™ EE Study Guide by Mark Cade and Humphrey SheilI agree with many of the explanations; essentially we are recognizing the distinction between the architectural design and the detailed design of the software systems.

While the goal of the designer is to be as precise and concrete in the specifications as it will be necessary for the development; the architect essentially aims at specifying the structure and global behavior of the system just as much as required for the detailed design to begin with.

A good architect will prevent hyper-specifications - the architecture must not be overly specified but just enough, the (architectural) decisions established only for the aspects that present costliest risks to handle, and effectively provide a framework (""commonality"") within which the detailed design can be worked upon i.e. variability for local functionality.

Indeed, the architecture process or life-cycle just follows this theme - adequate level of abstraction to outline the structure for the (architecturally) significant business requirements, and leave more details to the design phase for more concrete deliverables.Architecture is design, but not all design is architectural. Therefore, strictly speaking, it would make more sense to try to differentiate between architectural design and non-architectural design. And what is the difference? It depends! Each software architect may have a different answer (ymmv!). We develop our heuristics to come up with an answer, such as 'class diagrams are architecture and sequence diagrams are design'. See DSA book for more.

It's common to say that architecture is at a higher abstraction level than design, or architecture is logical and design is physical. But this notion, albeit commonly accepted, is in practice useless. Where do you draw the line between high or low abstraction, between logical and physical? It depends!

So, my suggestion is:


create a single design document.
name this design document the way you want or, better, the way the readers are more accustomed to. Examples: ""Software Architecture"", ""Software Design Specification"". 
break this document into views and keep in mind you can create a view as a refinement of another view. 
make the views in the document navigable by adding cross-references or hyperlinks
then you'll have higher level views showing broad but shallow overview of the design, and closer-to-implementation views showing narrow but deeper design details.
you may want to take a look at an example of multi-view architecture document (here).


Having said all that... a  more relevant question we need to ask is: how much design is enough? That is, when should I stop describing the design (in diagrams or prose) and should move on to coding?Yep that sounds right to me. The design is what you're going to do, and architecture is the way in which the bits and pieces of the design will be joined together. It could be language agnostic, but would normally specify the technologies to be used ie LAMP v Windows, Web Service v RPC.The software architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software components, the externally visible properties of those components, and the relationships between them.  

(from Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)

Software design is a process of problem-solving and planning for a software solution. After the purpose and specifications of software are determined, software developers will design or employ designers to develop a plan for a solution. It includes low-level component and algorithm implementation issues as well as the architectural view.

(from Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design)

Couldn't have said it better myself :)I view architecture as Patrick Karcher does - the big picture. For example, you can provide the architecture to a building, view its structural support, the windows, entries and exits, water drainage, etc. But you have not ""designed"" the floor layout's, cubicle positions etc.

So while you've architected the building you have not designed the layout of each office.
I think the same holds true for software.

You could view designing the layout, as ""architecting the layout"" though ...Good question... Although the line between them is hardly a bright sharp line,  imho, if you are using both terms, then Architecture encompasses more technical or structural decisions about how to build or construct something, especially those decisions that will be hard (or harder) to change once implemeneted, whereas Design encompasses those decisions that either are easy to change later (like method names, class <-> file organizational structure, design patterns, whether to use a singleton or a static class to solve some specific problem, etc. ) and/or those that effect the appearance or esthetic aspects of a system or application (Human Interface, ease of use, look and feel, etc.)Software architecture is“concerned with issues...beyond the algorithms and data structures of the computation.

Architecture is specifically not about…details of implementations (e.g., algorithms and data structures.) Architectural design involves a richer collection of abstractions than is typically provided by OOD” (object-oriented design).

Design is concerned with the modularization and detailed interfaces of the design elements, their algorithms and procedures, and the data types needed to support the architecture and to satisfy the requirements.

“architecture” is often used as a mere synonym for “design” (sometimes preceded with the adjective “high-level”). And many people use the term “architectural patterns” as a synonym for “design patterns.”

Check out this link.

Defining the Terms Architecture, Design, and ImplementationArchitecture:

Structural design work at higher levels of abstraction which realize technically significant requirements into the system. The architecture lays down foundation for further design.

Design:

The art of filling in what the architecture does not through an iterative process at each layer of abstraction.I really liked this paper for a rule of thumb on separating architecture from design:

http://www.eden-study.org/articles/2006/abstraction-classes-sw-design_ieesw.pdf

It's called the Intension/Locality hypothesis. Statements on the nature of the software that are non-local and intensional are architectural. Statements that are local and intensional are design....long time ago in a faraway place philosophers worried about the distinction between the one and the many.  Architecture is about relationship, which requires the many.  Architecture has components.  Design is about content, which requires the one.  Design has properties, qualities, characteristics.  We typically think that design is within architecture.  Dualistic thinking gives the many as primordial.  But architecture is also within design.  It's all how we choose to view what is before us - the one or the many.Pretty subjective but my take:

Architecture
The overall design of the system including interactions with other systems, hardware requirement, overall component design, and data flow.

Design
The organization and flow of a component in the overall system. This would also include the component's API for interaction with other components.Software architecture is best used at the system level, when you need to project business and functions identify by higher architecture levels into applications.

For instance, your business is about ""Profit and Loss"" for traders, and your main functions involved ""portfolio evaluation"" and ""risk computation"".

But when a Software Architect will details his solution, he will realize that:

""portfolio evaluation"" can not be just one application. It needs to be refined in manageable projects like:


GUI
Launcher
Dispatcher
...


(because the operations involved are so huge they need to be split between several computers, while still being monitored at all times through a common GUI)

a Software design will examine the different applications, their technical relationship and their internal sub-components.

It will produce the specifications needed for the last Architecture layer (the ""Technical Architecture"") to work on (in term of technical framework or transversal components), and for the project teams (more oriented on the implementation of the business functions) to begin their respective projects.if somebody constructs a ship, then engine, hull, electric-circuits etc. will be his ""architectural elements"". For him, engine-construction will be ""design work"".

If he then delegates the construction of the engine to another team, they will create an ""engine architecture""...

So - it depends on the level of abstraction or detail. One persons' architecture might be anothers' design!Architecture are ""the design decisions that are hard to change.""

After working with TDD, which practically means that your design changes all the time, I often found myself struggling with this question. The definition above is extracted from Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, By Martin Fowler 

It means that the architecture depends on the Language, Framework and the Domain of your system. If your can just extract an interface from your Java Class in 5 minutes it is no longer and architecture decision.Cliff Notes version:

Design: Implementing a solution based on the specifications of the desired product.

Architecture: The foundation/tools/infrastructure/components that support your design.

This is a pretty broad question that will invoke a lot of responses.Architecture is the resulting collection of design patterns to build a system.

I guess Design is the creativity used to put all this together?Software design has a longer history while the term software architecture is barely 20 years old.  Hence, it is going through growing pains right now.  

Academics tend to see Architecture as part of the larger field of software design.  Although there is growing recognition that Arch is a field within it's own.

Practitioners tend to see Arch as high-level design decisions that are strategic and can be costly in a project to undo.  

The exact line between Arch and design depends on the software domain. For instance, in the domain of Web Applications, the layered architecture is gaining the most popularity currently (Biz Logic Layer, Data Access Layer, etc.)  The lower level parts of this Arch are considered design (class diagrams, method signatures, etc.)  This would be defined differently in the domains of embedded systems, operating systems, compilers, etc.Architecture is high level, abstract and logical design whereas software design is low level,detailed and physical design.Also, refer to:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_Architectural_View_ModelI like Roy Thomas Fielding's definition and explanation about what is software architecture in his paper:
Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures 


  A software architecture is an abstraction of the run-time elements of a software system during some phase of its operation. A system may be composed of many levels of abstraction and many phases of operation, each with its own software architecture. 


He emphasizes ""run-time elements"" and ""levels of abstraction"".There is no definitive answer to this because ""software architecture"" and ""software design"" have quite a number of definitions and there isn't a canonical definition for either.

A good way of thinking of it is Len Bass, Paul Clements and Rick Kazman's statement that ""all architecture is design but not all design is architecture"" [Software Architecture in Practice].  I'm not sure I quite agree with that (because architecture can include other activities) but it captures the essence that architecture is a design activity that deals with the critical subset of design.

My slightly flippant definition (found on the SEI definitions page) is that it's the set of decisions which, if made wrongly, cause your project to get cancelled.

A useful attempt at separating architecture, design and implementation as concepts was done by Amnon Eden and Rick Kazman some years ago in a research paper entitled ""Architecture, Design, Implementation"" which can be found here: http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/ICSE03-1.pdf.  Their language is quite abstract but simplistically they say that architecture is design that can be used in many contexts and is meant to be applied across the system, design is (err) design that can be used in many contexts but is applied in a specific part of the system, and implementation is design specific to a context and applied in that context.

So an architectural decision could be a decision to integrate the system via messaging rather than RPC (so it's a general principle that could be applied in many places and is intended to apply to the whole system), a design decision might be to use a master/slave thread structure in the input request handling module of the system (a general principle that could be used anywhere but in this case is just used in one module) and finally, an implementation decision might be to move responsibilities for security from the Request Router to the Request Handler in the Request Manager module (a decision relevant only to that context, used in that context).

Software Development Analysis [closed],"That's the purpose of the blog, to make you feel inadequate so that you'll want to get better.  I know that's the effect it has on me.

Based on what little I've seen of his website, he seems to have the right sensibility, which is to use tools to simplify, not complicate.

He has quite the mug shot, too.It's an interesting read, but the most striking part to me was the link out for the concept of ""Technical Debt"". This is most intriguing.

He has good way of presenting tips and citing references as a part of the walk-through of how he solved (or came across) problems.Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 3 years ago. What do you think of Mr. King's software development analyst at http://devadept.com/? I ask because reading his blog has made me rethink how I should be coding software.  I mean, I used to concern myself with just getting a project done, but I think I may be missing something and his blog makes me feel that way. Am I just a programmer ""playing"" software architect?  I don't know, but one thing is for sure, and that is his blog has made me want to become a better coder and architect.A ha!!!!  He finally started blogging again.  I thought it was cool how Ivan caught a bug on one of his posts and he graciously thanked him and called him his pair from 10,000 kilometers away.

Splitting the Organization and Integrating the Code:
Conway's Law Revisited



Debugging the Development Process



Managing Humans - Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering ManagerI believe you will find most software developed for business systems follows iterative development cycles with a rough methodology similar to SCRUM even though most wouldn't have realized it.

The only times you will ever see a static methodology such as Waterfall would be in most likely a large government project that requires every single technical and business design document to be completed and approved before any type of software development begins.Since you are willing to spend money, you could turn to a professional analyst firm like Gartner Research.  They generate tons of reports and you might find something in their archives.  Major corporations often cite studies by Gartner.

If that does not yield any results, you should do a search in research papers.  Google Scholar might help you there.

If all else fails, and you have enough time on your hands, you could perform a small study yourself:  Pick random companies and tell them you are doing research and that you would like to ask them a few questions.If such a thing existed...


There would be standards based on the results.  If anywhere close to 50% of shops actually used Scrum or RUP or anything, there would be an applicable standards organization pounding out the details.  
We'd all be told specifically what to do based on the results.  Our lawyers and accountants would ask why we're using a methodology only used by 15% and not a methodology used by 28%.  We'd have to contend with armchair generals quoting the results at us.
There would be products for sale based on the results.  ""Supporting the most popular methodology.""  ""One of the most popular methodologies.""  ""Trouble-tickets for the fastest growing methodology.""
You'd see advertising that quoted the results and claiming specific quantitative benefits.  ""28% of organizations use our version of Scrum with improved on-time delivery.""


Ever see any advertising or standards based on adoption of a methodology?  Anything?

Such quantitative studies probably don't exist.

Also, a precondition for counting is definition.  Can you define Scrum in a way that it's somehow different from XP?  I doubt it.

I think this kind of data cannot possibly exist.  It requires far more formality and standardization than are even remotely possible for something so complex as software development.I don't think you will find reliable data on what you're looking for. I've been looking for that kind of figures for a few years and I haven't found them.

First of all, very few organisations tell you what method they are using. Some just don't use any. Some other don't know what they use, or what to call it. And some know what to call it, but won't disclose it for whatever reasons. Of the organisations that will tell you, which are (in my experience) a minority, there's a big assymetry in how they characterise what they tell you. The way in which your own question is worded illustrates this: most industry people (and many academics) today, when asked to list methodologies, think of waterfall, RUP, Scrum, XP, and a few other ""trademarked"" agile approaches. It is interesting, but they are perfectly capable of citing a number of agile approaches, the differences between which are usually much smaller than the differences between (almost forgotten) methods that are bunched together under ""waterfall"". Agile approaches are so heavily marketed and hyped that, like Coca-Cola or McDonald's, are so present in our daily lives.

Methodologies are often presented as either waterfall or agile. That is a terrible fallacy, fostered by the agile community. There are successful methodologies that do not qualify as waterfall and predate (and do not qualify as) agile. However, they seem to be ignored, and they rarely surface on surveys such as the one you demand in your question. Very rarely I find people in industry reporting to use methods such as Catalysis, OPEN/Metis or Fusion.

(Note: Don't misunderstand me; I appreciate the value and contributions of the agile movement. But I am no raving fan; I am a researcher who tries to make an objective assessment.)

In summary, I don't think you'll find a study with data that answers your question. But, in your search, I suggest you take into account these comments.

Good luck. :-)maybe not sound helpfull, but don't give to much to buzzwords. good programmer/software engineers with an sense/instinct what needs to be done you need. most of these proceses where invented because fearfull programmer sticked to closely to one of these pradigmes and the car went against the wall and some guy rightfully pointed out what they missed. but that can happen with most strategies if you don't see you situation in which you developing as a whole.

Software Development Methodology [closed],"I'd like to know the difference between Software Development Process and Software Development Methodology if there is any.A process is only a component of a methodology. A methodology has:


A process aspect: what tasks are to be carried out?
A product aspect: what things are to be used and/or created?
A people aspect: what people and teams are going to do all this?
A time aspect: how does all this get organised in time?
A modelling aspect: what modelling units (language) are used to capture all this?


This is a simplified interpretation of the more formal definitions that you can find in ISO/IEC 24744 Software Engineering - Metamodel for Development Methodologies.

Still, the terms ""method"", ""methodology"" and ""process"" are used by different people with different meanings. After 20 years working in this field, I think that trying to agree on a standard use is futile. :-)It's the same as the difference between process and methodology in any other discipline.  I think of the processes as the implementation of the methodology.The methodology is more a general mindset which sets basic parameters. A process is a concrete manifestation within the given borders of the methodology. You can think of agile as methodology and Scrum as concrete implementation. 

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish between the two. As rule of thumb: If you can immediately start to work with it, it's probably a process. A methodology requires more adaptation .A more wide term would be Software Development Philosophies.

Software Display Problem,"Using VB6 My Default Software display setting as ""800 x 600"" Clients having different display setting like ""800 x 600"", ""1366 x 768"", ""1280 x 768"" Client using the software more than ""800 x 600"" display setting means software is not fitted with full screen.  Software is displaying 75% width of the monitor size. When i manually resize the software according to the display, the images are displaying very large. How to display the software in a full screen according to the monitor display size. Need Code HelpThe simple option is to allow the users the ability to maximize your form, which will cause it to fill the entire screen, regardless of their computer's current resolution settings. 

The only problem with this approach is that it won't stretch/resize the controls on your form to match its new size. The layout will look the same as it did before, but now it will be crammed into the upper-left corner, with a vast expanse of empty space below and to the right of it. So the trick is dynamically resizing the controls on your form whenever the form itself changes size.

Unfortunately, VB 6 doesn't have any built-in support for this. You have no choice but to write the code to handle resizing all of your controls yourself. The best place to do this is your form's Resize event. You can determine the current size of your form by checking its ScaleWidth and ScaleHeight properties. Each of your controls expose a similar Width and Height property that you can use to set their sizes, relative to the size of their container form. You'll need to devise some rudimentary mathematical logic to determine the sizes. A quick Google search should turn up several examples of how others have done this, but there's no shining model available.

One example can be found in e-mail programs like Microsoft Outlook. You might have  a TreeView that takes up 100% of the form's height, but only 50% of its width; a ListView that takes up 50% of the form's height and 50% of its width; and a TextBox positioned under that taking up 50% of the form's height and 50% of its width. That would produce a fluid layout similar to that shown below:

--------------------------------
|              |               |
|              |               |
|              |   ListView    |
|              |               |

|   TreeView   |---------------|

|              |    TextBox    |
|              |               |
|              |               |
--------------------------------Just change your main form to be maximized (set the property window state to 2 - Maximized) and then make sure that any controls it contains resizes or moves as needed.You can use the move method to resize the controls.
Make use of scalewidth,scaleheight,scalemode,twipsperpixel properties while resizing.

But move method wont work correctly when resizing controls in an SSTab which needs some more effort overcome that.You can refer this 

Other way is to design the forms in the least resolution (i.e 800X600) so that form
will be displayed in all other resolutions.",,,,,1,478,78.23,50.02,25.17,25.64,23.9,21.55,81.8,63.81,49.58,10.88,4.6,0.63,0,3.35,0,0.63,6.28,18.62,8.58,4.6,13.18,7.74,2.93,5.23,1.26,13.39,4.81,7.95,2.72,0,1.05,1.67,14.85,1.26,13.39,1.67,3.97,2.3,1.05,0,4.18,0,0.84,0.63,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.28,1.88,0.84,0,0,0,0.42,4.39,0,0,0,0,2.51,0.63,0,1.88,2.3,0,0.21,2.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.84,0,0.63,0.63,0.63,0,0,0,0.21,3.97,10.67,0.84,1.05,6.49,2.51,0,0,2.72,0.84,4.81,2.09,0,0,0,0,0,39.12,4.81,2.93,0,0,1.88,29.5,
Software Engineering Component Repository Tool,"I'm working as a software engineer for a company. We are going to apply some software engineering standards in our development process. We need a tool which provides a repository for our peripheral products (functions, classes, libraries, ...) which is created during software development process for later use. The tool should provide some functionalities (e.g Name of the component, it's functionality, withing which projects it is used?, author, publication date, list of known bugs, user rating, comment, ...) and it's better to have a web-based interface. Does anybody know such a software?You should check out FogBugz. Its a great project management tool which has recently released Kiln which is source control you can integrate with your projects.

A cheaper alternative is to look at something like XP-Dev.Open source tools like GIT or SVN may provide source code management however they may lack in the functions you are asking particularly bugs or ratings. There are also many paid tools available in the market which not only provides source code management but also management and integrations over projects. You may explore:

TFS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Foundation_Server
Rational Clear Case http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/clearcaseIn my experience, such a tool doesn't exist because the problem is solved differently. Companies typically use component frameworks, whether their own or 3rd party, and develop new components that conform to the component standard from their framework. 

Each project then depends on the framework rather than on specific versions of specific components. This also resolves interdependencies and all related version compatibility issues.

Component framework is typically documented somewhere by its vendor and newly created components can be added to your company's wiki, such as mediaWiki.

Alternatively, the company may need some knowledge management. See the introductory videos from kbPublisher. kbPublisher is an OpenSource Knowledge Base which may be even more suitable than a groupware like mediaWiki. The free version of kbPublisher can be downloaded here.

Note each project should have a feature which displays the framework version number and configuration, as needed by staff.

GreetingsGSMA published Embedded SIM Specification and it has been already implemented by device manufacturers on several models. This standard defines remote provisioning of machine to machine (M2M) and mobile consumer devices by taking “over the air” concept much further. Now OTA can perform initial MNO subscription and change subscription from one MNO to another through eSIM profile provisioning flow,  Refer to the SGP.22 for the details 


Profile Preparation
When user is ready to subscribe to the operator's service, the MNO prepares a profile in the SM-DP+ . MNO and SM-DP+ shares a code that identifies the generated profile in the SM-DP+. The operator provides the code and the SM-DP+ address to the user
Profile download
The user launches the LPA in the device, and inputs the code and the SM-DP+ address. The LPA contacts the SM-DP+ and augments the eUICC to establish a secure channel to the SM-DP+. If the eUICC and SM-DP+ successfully completes mutual authentication, then the LPA downloads a profile package from the SM-DP+.
Profile installation and report

Software Instruments,"I really enjoyed the music apps on the iPhone, like Ocarnia by Smule and I have always wanted to create a music app for Android. Is there some sort of API/Framework that you can use to create software instruments/create ""styled"" sounds? 
Thanks! *EDIT*
I found a Java Music programming API called ""JFugue"", but it cannot be built in Android, due to its lack of Java MIDI support... Is there something like ""JFugue"" available?I know nothing about those apps.

but there are a few different ways you could achieve musical type applications on android.

MediaPlayback <--- will give you an overview of how to use MediaPlayer object to load and play your own sound files.

MediaPlayer <---more in-depth look at how the MediaPlayer object works.

SoundPool <--- an alternative to MediaPlayer. SoundPool was designed to hold multiple sounds and is capable of playing them accross multiple streams. MediaPlayer on the other hand can only have one piece of media loaded at a time.

and ToneGenerator but I have to go now. You'll have to search around for that one yourself, sorry.There are a couple of approaches you might take

You can include instrument samples as application resources, and play them with MediaPlayer/SoundPool. For more information, see the media player topic

You also can take a more procedural approach, where you dynamically generate the actual audio samples yourself, and then play them back using AudioTrack.

Android does have limited midi support via the JetPlayer class. But it doesn't support dynamic generation of midi events, it can only play a pre-existing midi file.There are APIs on Android that can be used to make software instruments, and the other answers covered some of them.

But there's a much bigger problem, which is the ridiculously high latency (that is, the delay from the time you issue the software command to the time that the sound comes out the speaker). On most Android hardware, it's something like 400 ms, which is unacceptable for even a ""toy"" musical instrument (that's almost a quarter note at a moderate tempo!)

Search for ""android audio latency"" and you'll see thousands of comments from pissed-off developers, but no real solutions. Google is certainly aware of the problem, but nobody knows when they'll fix it.

Basically I want to be the sole person who can distribute it for commercial purposes. However, non-commercial distribution and modification is open for everyone.License Information

Here is a useful breakdown of the different software licenses.  Jeff Atwood's Coding Horror blog does a great job explaining each license type.



Name: None | Source: Open | Type (Clauses): None

Without a license, the code is copyrighted by default. People can read the code, but they have no legal right to use it. To use the code, you must contact the author directly and ask permission.

Name: Public domain | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Permissive (0)

If your code is in the public domain, anyone may use your code for any purpose whatsoever. Nothing is in the public domain by default; you have to explicitly put your work in the public domain if you want it there. Otherwise, you must be dead a long time before your work reverts to the public domain.

Name: GPL | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Copyleft (12)

The archetypal bearded, sandal-clad free software license. Your code can never be used in any proprietary program, ever! Take that, capitalism!

Name: LGPL | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Mostly Copyleft (16)

GPL with a cleverly-constructed pressure valve release. Your free software can be binary linked to proprietary programs under certain very specific circumstances.

Name: MIT/X11 | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Permissive (2)

Short and sweet. Includes generic legal disclaimer of liability.

Name: BSD | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Permissive (2)

Short and sweet. Includes legal disclaimer of liability with explicitly named organization.

Name: Apache | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Permissive (9)

Requires derivative works to provide notification of any licensed or proprietary code in a common location.

Name: Eclipse | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Permissive (7)

Business friendly. Allows derivative works to choose their own license for their contributions.

Name: Mozilla | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Weak Copyleft (13)

Allows liberal mixing with proprietary software.

Name: MS Permissive | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Permissive (3)

Resembles the MIT and BSD licenses. Not formally accepted by OSI, and also offered in a ""Windows-only"" LPL variant.

Name: MS Community | Source: Open | Type (Clauses):Copyleft (3)

Resembles the GPL license. Requires all contributed code to be returned to the community. Not formally accepted by OSI, and also offered in a ""Windows-only"" LCL version.

Name: MS Reference | Source: Proprietary | Type (Clauses):Read Only (3)

You can review the code, or make copies of it, but you can't use it or change it in any way. Allows a window (no pun intended) on formerly completely proprietary, secret code.

If you do not have a software license template to use, take a look at what Binpress's license generator.  I am not a Binpress employee.  I came across their tool and found it useful.When you are the copyright owner, you can define the terms of use much to your liking...

You could require your customers / licensees to use your software under a license such as GNU GPL, Creative Commons NonCommercial ShareAlike or anything you deem appropriate.Yes, you simply need to use multi-licensing to distribute your software under two or more different sets of terms and conditions. There are a number of products using this approach, one of the good examples is MySQL.It's a typical case when license templates will not help you much.

Software Routing,"""Commercial software routers from companies such as Vyatta can typically only attain transfer data at speeds of up to three gigabits per second. That isn’t fast enough to take advantage of the full speed of a typical network card, which operates at 10 gigabits per second."" [1] How is the speed of the network interface card relevant in this scenario? Aren't software routers connecting multiple Virtual Machines running on the same physical host? [2] Unless a PC has multiple network interface cards, it is unlikely that it functions as a packet switch between different physical hosts. My interpretation suggests that there seem to exist two different kinds of software routing: (1) Embedding a real time operating system on an actual router. (2) Writing application layer code on a PC that can handle packets being transmitted between different virtual machines running on that very PC. Is this correct?It depends on what your router is doing. If it's literally just looking at a static route table and forwarding packets out another interface, there isn't much hit in performance. 

It's when you get into things like NAT, Crypto, QoS, SPI... that you will see performance degradation. Hardware vendors are usually using custom silicon to process the more advanced features, this allows for higher throughput packet forwarding. 

Now that merchant silicon is fast enough and the open source applications are getting better, the performance gap is closing. 

It really depends on your use case as far as what you want to use. I've gone with both and not seen performance hits, but the software versions weren't handling high throughput workloads.Performance of the link from the virtual network to the physical eventually becomes important at any reasonable scale.  You're right that, within the same physical host, things can be pretty quick, but that requires that one can get everything needed in one box.

While merchant silicon has come a long way in improving the performance of networking equipment, greater gains are taking place getting CPU's to handle networking tasks better.  Both AMD and Intel have improved their architectures to the point where 10 Gbps forwarding is a reality.  Intel has developed a specialized library (DPDK Wiki Page) that takes care of a lot of low-level networking functions at high performance.",,,,,1,377,77.42,28.4,39.89,35.25,19.84,29.71,80.37,63.4,46.42,9.55,2.39,0.53,0,1.59,0,0.27,7.16,15.65,6.63,3.18,13,7.96,3.71,3.71,1.33,15.38,10.88,5.57,2.39,0,1.86,0.8,12.47,0.27,12.2,1.33,2.39,1.59,2.12,0.53,4.51,0,2.12,1.59,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.24,1.33,0.27,0,0,0,0.8,2.65,0,0,0,0.8,3.98,0,0,3.98,5.04,0,0,4.77,0.8,0,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.53,0.27,2.12,0,0.8,0,0.53,0,0,5.84,9.55,0,1.86,7.16,0.8,0,0,2.92,1.33,7.69,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,15.65,5.31,3.45,0.8,0,2.39,3.71,
Software SPI Implementation,"I'm thinking about creating my own pure-C software SPI library because there are none available (as far as I can tell). Which also worries me - why aren't there any software SPI libraries? Is there some hardware limitation I'm not considering? EDIT: I've decided to write my own library due to how buggy the SPI peripheral is in STM32. Especially in 8 bit mode, but I've also had a lot of problems with 16 bit mode. Many other issues I didn't even bother documenting. I've now written the software implementation (it is pretty easy) and in works just fine.why aren't there any software SPI libraries?


Because it's about 10 lines of code each for the WriteByte and ReadByte functions, and most of that is bit banging processor-specific registers. The higher level protocol depends on the device connected to the SPI. Here's what wikipedia has to say on the subject


  The SPI bus is a de facto standard. However, the lack of a formal
  standard is reflected in a wide variety of protocol options. Different
  word sizes are common. Every device defines its own protocol,
  including whether or not it supports commands at all. Some devices are
  transmit-only; others are receive-only. Chip selects are sometimes
  active-high rather than active-low. Some protocols send the least
  significant bit first.


So there's really no point in making a library. You just write the code for each specific situation, and combination of devices.Although the others have answered that its just bitbanging; I would argue that there is benefit to writing a small layer:


If you don't use a HAL, or the Standard Libs (like myself) you can write a layer to deal with initialization which can do things as per the initialisation sequence of the chip.
You can map all your interrupt vectors for a specific peripheral in this layer utilising callback mechanisms
Create separation between application and system domains which is a core principle for modular design
Increase of code reusability utilising techniques such as function pointers and common interfaces
Add input validation on settings/parameters that would otherwise cause code duplication if no layer was used. For example, ensuring that the HCLK does not exceed 180MHz on the stm32f429 when initialising it.


Whilst it is true that to send data generally all you need to do is set a register, but more often that not the initialisation sequence is complicated.

With the increase in power and capacity in microcontrollers along with project size, its important to implement balanced design choices that promote scalability and maintainability - especially in commercial projects.If you are asking for microcontrollers then you can have your own SPI library.
You need to use bit-banging technique for that.
There are software SPI libraries available.
As every microcontroller have different PORT architecture and registers those are not generic and they are specific for that controller only.

Software Safety Standards [closed],"Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post. Closed 1 year ago. What industry known software safety standards has anyone had experience in having to adhere to while developing software that is involved in controlling a device/system that has potential to harm the individuals using it?Different industries have different standards. Aircraft and robotics for example. Standards are still evolving in some new industries, such as surgical robots. Still there are some common elements. The first is redundancy. I work with industrial robots. For critical items such as speed control, we use three different calculations on two different controllers. For emergency stop systems we use dual circuits, every red e-stop button has two physical switches behind it. 

I used to work on aircraft. On aircraft autopilots there are often two or even three separate computers doing the calculations and comparing results.

The goal is to prevent any single failure from making the system unsafe. 

You need to look at the rules and regulations that govern the area you are working in to see what the legal requirements are, but you have to make the entire system safe.MISRA is the standard followed in the automotive industry, but it's a coding standard to ensure correctness of operation and portability.

You need to read up on the Therac accidents to understand the complexity of this issue.

Also, NASA and military documents are widely available and discuss standards for coding that allow determination of safety of the system.

-AdamNot a saftey standard, but reading comp.risks for a while will show the kind of problems you will need to work hard to prevent.

(The book, ""Computer Related Risks"" is very good as well.)Software should never run a system that could injure someone. The only possible (and still questionable) time this might be false is when using a safety reliable PLC which is specially engineered for safety.

You should look into:

Software Signing,"I am new to software security, but so far reading about software signing on Android, I understand software signing is useful to prevent someone from injecting code inside your code. The user of the software can compare the software hash with your signature using your signature's public key, and if they don't match so the software is altered. What I don't understand is how this really ensures protection using self signing software. What prevents someone from changing my software, injecting his code inside it, taking my self signed signature off, and making a brand new one on top of it? this way this new signature will say that everything is ok with the software and I will only find it out IF I have access to the modified software right? Or is it there something that I am not understating about the process?What prevents someone from changing my software, injecting his code inside it, taking my self signed signature off, and making a brand new one on top of it?

Software Testing vs Software Evaluation [closed],"This question does not appear to be about a specific programming problem, a software algorithm, or software tools primarily used by programmers. If you believe the question would be on-topic on another Stack Exchange site, you can leave a comment to explain where the question may be able to be answered. Closed 4 years ago. Can anyone clearly explain the difference between Software Testing and Software Evaluation? I think I have pretty clear what Testing is, but I don't have that clear what Evaluation is, so can you please provide an example? And finally, if I wanted to include a list of the previously defined requirements of the project, establishing whether each of them has been achieved, and in the case it's not been achieved, a discussion of why not... where does this fit?Software Testing: 
Software Testing is the Process of Executing a program instant of finding error.

Software Evaluation: 
A software evaluation is a type of assessment that seeks to determine if software or a combination of software programs is the best possible fit for the needs of a given client.First of all, these terms are not related. Software testing is the process to make sure that the software that you are coding meets client's requirements and it is relatively free from bugs. Software evaluation on the other hand is to identify an already available software which might suit your need.

Assume your need is for a database compare tool. You have 2 options - either you create your own custom made software (or get some vendor to create one for you) or you can look to buy an off-the-shelf or ready-made tool. In case you are creating your own custom made tool, it would mean that it needs to be planned, designed, coded, tested and then implemented. This would involve a complete software development life-cycle. Here, testing comes into the picture.

If you choose to purchase an already developed tool, then you might look for different vendors to quote their projects, the tools capability. You might want to try out all of them to see which one is the best tool for you w.r.t. your need and pricing. This is software evaluation.Software Evaluation is a widespread relative term. 

According to Wikipedia:


  Evaluation is a systematic determination of a subject's merit, worth
  and significance, using criteria governed by a set of standards. It
  can assist an organization to assess any aim, realisable
  concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making; or
  to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim
  and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed.
  
  The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into
  prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in
  the identification of future change.


As you see, it's complex and related to business administration B.A.

I think you are looking for a procedure model, like Quantitative Methods for Software Selection and Evaluation. There's no standard model or guidelines for evaluation handling in software.Software Testing is a method of finding out whether a software is working as it should, e.g. giving correct output, working fast enough, handling expected loads, responding to user inputs properly.

Software Evaluation is a process of judging how well the Software’s original intended goals have been achieved.

Software Versioning,"Platform : Visual Studio 2008 (I know it's old but I have my own reasons). I am new to the concept of software versioning so I need advice as how to use it. Currently, here is how I use software versioning:- I learned this from here. Now the problem I can think of is that when the software reaches version 3.5.17.3485 from version 1.0.0.0 then there would be bajillion lines of code. For example: Update 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.1 Update 1.0.0.1 to 1.0.0.2 Update 1.0.0.2 to 1.0.0.3 Now lets assume that updating from version 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.1 took 40 lines of code to change the design of database or files stored in the system and for every separate update it will take more and more code depending upon the update. Now after reaching 3.5.17.3485 version think of how many lines of code will be there. Can anyone tell me how to handle such a situation?You should look into Semantic Versioning:


  Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes increment the major version.


Only releases that change the major version actually might require the user of your application to change his/her own code.Why would the developer need to maintain update logs?  If you use svn/git or anything else  the task can easily be automated.  Also, I think everyone would be quite happy if the readme/history files for version 3.5.17.xxx were only containing logs since version 3.5.0.0.

Software architecture design patterns,"Can you please educate me on what are the software architecture design patterns that are available? To elaborate my question, I want to read through different architecture design patterns and decide what suits my project requirements? For example, there are Enterprise application design patterns, Enterprise Integration design patterns, ESB patterns, SOA patterns etc. Patterns occur at many levels.  Architecture patterns (i.e., architectural styles) are generally the largest in scope and cover the fundamental organization of the system.  Design patterns are at the level of several collaborating objects.  Bernd's suggestion of Fowler's and other enterprise patterns is a good one.  Just recognize that those patterns tend to be more specific than these architectural patterns:


Layered (i.e., virtual machine pattern)
Big Ball of Mud
Pipe and Filter
Batch-Sequential
Model-Centered (Shared Data)
Publish-Subscribe
Client-Server (and N-Tier)
Peer-to-peer
MapReduce


Architecture patterns most often apply to the runtime structure of the system, but can also apply to its modules or its hardware allocation.  One common mistake is to think that the Layered pattern applies to the runtime when it really applies to a system's modules (i.e., its compile-time dependencies).  You can, of course, mirror your module structure in the runtime 

These patterns are discussed in detail in my book, Just Enough Software Architecture, Fairbanks (2010).  Most of them are also covered in other books including Garlan & Shaw (1996), Taylor, Medvidovic, & Dashovy (2009), and Documenting Software Architectures (SEI, 2010).  

With the list of pattern names, you should be able to find plenty of web pages (I've marked this as a community Wiki so that we can add those links).  The books are helpful too because they give you more insight on how to use the patterns.Read these books:


Martin Folwler: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture

Software benefits of FPGA,"I have a doubt: I understood that it takes advantage of hardware parallelism and that it controls I/O at the hardware level in order to provide faster response times but which are the software benefits of an FPGA? Which software components can be accelerated? Thanks in advance.Both for prototyping and parallelism. Since FPGAs are cheap they are good candidates for using both when making industrial protypes and paralell systems. FPGAs consist of arrays of logic elements connected with wires. The elements contain small lookup tables and flip-flops. FPGAs scale to thousands of lookup tables. Lookup tables and programmable wires are flexible enough to implement any logic function. Once you have the function ready then you might want to use ASIC. Xilinx and Altera are the major brands. Personally I use the Altera DE2 and DE2-115.You are correct about the parallelism and I/O control of an FPGA.  FPGA's are just huge re-configurable logic circuits that allow a developer to create circuits with very specific and dedicated functions.  They typically come with a very large amount of I/O when compared to typical micro-controllers as well.  Because it is basically a bunch of gates in silicon, everything you code in your hardware description language (HDL) will happen in parallel.  This combined with the fact that you can write custom circuits is what gives the ability to accelerate operations in an FPGA over a typical processor even though the processor may have a much higher clock speed.  To better illustrate this point, lets say you have an algorithm that you need to run and you want to compare an FPGA to a processor.  The FPGA is clocked at 100Mhz and the processor at 3Ghz.  This means the processor is running at a rate that is 30 times faster than the FPGA.  Let's say you code up a circuit that is capable of computing the algorithm on the FPGA in 10 clock cycles.  The equivalent algorithm on a processor could take thousands of instructions to execute.  This places the FPGA far ahead of the processor in terms of performance.  And, because of the parallel nature of FPGA's, if you code it right and the flow through the FPGA is continuous, every clock cycle, the FPGA can finish the computation of a new result.  This is because every stage in an FPGA will execute concurrently.  So it may take 10 clock cycles, but at each clock cycle, a different piece of 10 different results can be computed simultaneously (this is called pipelinine: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28computing%29 ).  The processor is not capable of this and can not compute the different stages in parallel without taking extra time to do so.  Processors are also bound on a performance level by their instruction set whereas on an FPGA, this can be overcome by good and application specific circuit design.  A processor is a very general design that can run any combination of instructions, so it takes longer to compute things because of its generalized nature.  FPGAs also don't have the issues of moving things in and out of cache or RAM.  They typically do use RAM, but in a parallel nature that does not inhibit or bottleneck the flow of the processing.  It is also interesting to note that a processor can be created and implemented on an FPGA because you can implement the circuits that compose a processor.

Typically, you find FPGAs on board with processors or microcontrollers to speed up very math intensive or Digital Signal Processing (DSP) tasks, or tasks that require a large flow of data.  For example, a wireless modem that communicates via RF will have to do quite a bit of DSP to pick signals out of the air and decode them.  Something like the receiver chip in a cell phone.  There will be lots of data continually flowing in and out of the device.  This is perfect for an FPGA because it can process such a large amount of data and in parallel.  The FPGA can then pass the decoded data off to a microcontroller to allow it to do things like display the text from a text message on a pretty touchscreen display.  Note that the chip in your cell phone is not an FPGA, but an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).  This is a bunch of circuits stripped down to the bare minimum for maximum performance and minimal cost.  However, it is easy to prototype ASICs on FPGAs and they are very similar.  An FPGA can be wasteful because it can have a lot of resources on board that are not needed.  Generally you only move from an FPGA to an ASIC if you are going to be producing a TON of them and you know they work perfectly and will only ever have to do exactly what they currently do.  Cell phone transceiver chips are perfect for this.  They sell millions and millions of them and they only have to do that one thing their entire life.

On something like a desktop processor, it is common to see the term ""hardware accleration"".  This generally means that an FPGA or ASIC is on board to speed up certain operations.  A lot of times this means that an ASIC (probably on the die of the processor) is included to do anything such as floating point math, encryption, hashing, signal processing, string processing, etc.  This allows the processor to more efficiently process data by offloading certain operations that are known to be difficult and time consuming for a processor.  The circuit on the die, ASIC, or FPGA can do the computation in parallel as the processor does something else, then gets the answer back.  So the speed up can be very large because the processor is not bogged down with the computation, and is freed up to continue processing other things while the other circuit performs the operation.Some think of FPGAs as an alternative to processors. This is usually fundamentally wrong.
FPGAs are customizable logic. You can implement a processor in a FPGA and then run your regular software on that processor.
The key advantage with FPGAs is the flexibility to implement any kind of logic.

Think of a processor system. It might have a serial port, USB, Ethernet. What if you need another more specialized interface which your processor system does not support? You would need to change your hardware. Possibly create a new ASIC.

With a FPGA you can implement a new interface without the need for new hardware or ASICs.

FPGAs are almost never used to replace a processor. The FPGA is used for particular tasks, such as implementing a communications interface, speed up a specific operation, switch high bandwidth communication traffic, or things like that. You still run your software on a CPU.",,,,,1,1136,78.68,44.75,23.68,39.46,18.32,23.15,80.72,66.55,55.46,10.12,4.14,0.53,0.18,2.29,0,1.14,5.99,16.81,10.21,1.41,14.44,8.89,4.14,6.78,0.79,14.35,5.63,4.4,2.11,0.18,1.23,0.88,13.12,0.44,12.68,1.41,2.29,2.29,3.26,0.35,4.05,0,1.85,1.58,0.26,0.26,0.18,0.09,0,0,0,0,5.9,2.02,0.26,0.09,0,0.09,1.32,3.7,0,0,0,0,2.46,0.09,0,2.38,3.26,0,0,2.99,0.26,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,1.06,0.18,0.62,0.18,0.18,0,0.26,0,0.44,3.61,6.69,0,2.02,4.4,0.26,0,0,4.05,0.88,6.43,1.58,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,11.44,5.63,2.82,0.26,0,0.35,2.38,
Software development process and lawyer [closed],"On any if you ask a question about licenses, patents or copyright everybody will refer you to the lawyer (see SO’s “ask-a-lawyer” tag). I’m trying to setup a software development process where there will be place for a lawyer. But I cannot find any well known process that includes a lawyer, what activities a he or she performs. Can you referrer me to some publicly available resource that will explain lawyer activities and part in a software development process (RUP, MSF, XP, etc.)?

It’s really hard to convince a customer to pay money for something for activities that will cost more than project development :-) How currently organizations handle legal expenses for customer projects in most cases: via overhead or via time and materials?Since it looks, from the comments, like you're specifically trying to avoid infringing on anyone else's patents in your software development process, I'll address that point in particular.

I don't know of any software process methodology that specifically addresses the point of ""lawyer-clean"" code, but plenty (most?) of them address ""clean"" code in general (via code reviews), so getting it ""lawyer-clean"" is more-or-less just another phase of code review.

In practice, the costs of having a lawyer review all (or some ""risky"" subset) of your code base as it's developed is unlikely to be cost-effective for a customer, and I doubt you'll find anyone willing to pay for it -- the risk/benefit ratio, especially for custom code (which nobody else is going to see source for).  I can theoretically envisage some ultra-paranoid company wanting it, so there might be a niche market for it, like high-reliability/formal verification development tools/processes.  Don't expect it to ever be mass-market.

Also, on the other side, you'd have to find a lawyer willing to do all of the hard yards in understanding your code and finding any relevant patents that might apply.  I know a couple of patent-searching lawyers (doing IT for them was a speciality of a former job), and it's not a simple task to identify which patent(s) might infringe a chunk of code you've written.  I'd expect that you'd almost need a patent lawyer per developer to keep up with the output volume, and the rates they'll charge will make the most outrageous hourly rate you've seen from an IT contractor seem like chicken feed.

Lawyers are also notoriously conservative creatures -- they'll typically say ""no go"" to anything that looks even vaguely suspect.  You can't second-guess them, either, otherwise all those carefully-crafted protections you're selling to your customers are utterly worthless, so your code will have to be squeaky-clean to pass the lawyer(s)' scrutiny.  Good luck writing code at a reasonable pace without using any new technology, process, or algorithm from the last 25 years...

Finally, assuming all of the above comes together, and you find a customer, a lawyer or several, and you manage to produce code that passes their paranoia filters, what do you do if your lawyer(s) miss a patent, and your customer gets sued?  They'll sue you, and you'll have to sue the lawyer who stuffed up (or, rather, his/her professional indemnity insurance) to get any money out of them.  What's more, all the patent search agreements I've seen have been of the ""all care, but no responsibility"" form.  You might be able to crack that facade, with some extra legal maneuvering, but it'll cost you more again.

Very similar things apply to trademarks, incidentally.  Copyright is a different beast, and something that your lawyer won't be able to detect in advance (how do they know that a programmer hasn't ripped a pile of code out of a previous employer's product?).  For copyright, your best protection is to educate your developers on what constitutes copyright infringement, and thwack hard anyone dumb enough to break the rules.You don't need a lawyer as part of a software development process but you should get a lawyer whenever a legal document is involved (a license agreement or a contract for example).

Just like a small business should have lawyer write employee contracts but doesn't keep a full time lawyer in-house for that, you get a lawyer for a few hours to write you license or contract and then you fill in the names - or pay the lawyer another hour to fill in the names for you.

Once you know what legal requirements you have to fulfill in your fields (and for most software I believe there are none) you don't need a lawyer for development, all the contract work is outside the scope of the software project - at least until a salesperson adds a new feature to a contract to close a sale.I don't think you'll find a ""lawyer"" milestone in any software development process.  It seems a waste of time to find one to cite for your customer's benefit.  Even if you could, I doubt that it would provide enough cover for the objections you're worried about that will cost more than software development.

There are lawyers that specialize in open source software, but the only ""free as in beer"" law that I know is ""pro bono"".

The best argument I can think of to justify this is to figure out what a patent fight would cost if you don't bring in a lawyer.  

If you know the probability of being hit with such a suit you could multiply the average cost times the probability to come up with a dollar figure to compare to the lawyer's fees.  That might be a more convincing argument than citing a software development methodology.",,,,,1,932,62.86,67.7,28.04,25.79,30.06,21.89,86.16,68.35,55.69,13.73,7.94,1.61,0,4.83,0.43,0.97,5.79,16.74,8.48,0.32,14.16,9.66,4.08,5.69,1.72,16.63,5.69,6.01,4.94,0.11,0.97,3.86,16.74,1.61,14.91,4.08,1.07,1.93,4.83,0.21,4.83,0,2.36,1.39,0.97,0.64,0.21,0.43,0.21,0.21,0,0,10.62,2.36,0.11,0,0.32,0.32,1.07,8.05,0,0,0.21,0.21,1.5,0.11,0,1.39,9.76,0,0,8.05,2.68,0,0.43,0.11,0,0,0.11,0.11,0,0.32,0,1.29,0.11,0.54,0.11,0.75,0,0.21,0.86,0.21,5.58,6.55,0.32,0.64,3.97,0.75,0.21,0.32,2.15,1.07,4.83,3.54,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,21.03,3.54,4.83,0.54,0,4.08,8.05,
Software evaluation - licence [closed],"This question does not appear to be about programming within the scope defined in the help center. Closed 7 years ago. Can any one help me on software licence module.
We created a new application and want to release a demo version(30 days trial) of our tool later we need full version.
How can i generate license file or license code and how to limit 30 days evaluation.
Please give me some help on this. Our application is developed on windows in QTThere could be several possibilities:


Timestamp and encrypt the date of installation somewhere safe(registry or an external encrypted file)
Upon each run, validate the registry date as well as the system date.
User may tamper with system date/time; so you may would want to validate the system date/time wrt previous run date/time, and plan you app's actions accordingly.
Show the app-dormant error message upon currentDate - installationDate > 30, and provide a link to your online registration page.


You may also require to:


Develop a keygen(key encryptor) that would generate(a hash out of a certain key) the serial key.
Add the key decrytor in your product that, upon getting the key from user input, would try to generate the same(hash?) key and compare that hash with your decryptor algo.


Checkout this and this that uses SerialNumberTemplate to get serial number during installation.

--EDIT--

You can note the time either from:


The date of installation: Create a Custom Action in your visual studio setup project; and add registry item in Install override method.
The date from first-run: Use DateTime.Now.Date to get the current date and encrypt/save it somewhere, probably registry.Although I don't see the connection to patents it's as easy as that:

Software evaluation licensing [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 7 years ago. My company is looking to start distributing some software we developed and would like to be able to let people try the software out before buying.  We'd also like to make sure it can't be copied and distributed to our customers' customers. One model we've seen is tying a license to a MAC address so the software will only work on one machine. What I'm wondering is, what's a good way to generate a license key with different information embedded in it such as license expiration date, MAC address, and different software restrictions?I've used both FLEXlm from Macrovision (formerly Globetrotter) and the newer RLM from Reprise Software (as I understand, written by FlexLM's original authors).  Both can key off either the MAC address or a physical dongle, can be either node-locked (tied to one machine only) or ""floating"" (any authorized machine on the network can get a license doled out by a central license server, up to a maximum number of simultaneously checked-out copies determined by how much they've paid for).  There are a variety of flexible ways to set it up, including expiration dates, individual sub-licensed features, etc.  Integration into an application is not very difficult.  These are just the two I've used, I'm sure there are others that do the job just as well.

These programs are easily cracked, meaning that there are known exploits that let people either bypass the security of your application that uses them, either by cutting their own licenses to spoof the license server, or by merely patching your binary to bypass the license check (essentially replacing the subroutine call to their library with code that just says ""return 'true'"".  It's more complicated than that, but that's what it mostly boils down to.  You'll see cracked versions of your product posted to various Warez sites.  It can be very frustrating and demoralizing, all the more so because they're often interested in cracking for cracking sake, and don't even have any use for your product or knowledge of what to do with it.  (This is obvious if you have a sufficiently specialized program.)

Because of this, some people will say you should write your own, maybe even change the encryption scheme frequently.  But I disagree.  It's true that rolling your own means that known exploits against FLEXlm or RLM won't instantly work for your application.  However, unless you are a total expert on this kind of security (which clearly you aren't or you wouldn't be asking the question), it's highly likely that in your inexperience you will end up writing a much less secure and more crackable scheme than the market leaders (weak as they may be).

The other reason not to roll your own is simply that it's an endless cat and mouse game.  It's better for your customers and your sales to put minimal effort into license security and spend that time debugging or adding features.   You need to come to grips with the licensing scheme as merely ""keeping honest people honest"", but not preventing determined cracking.  Accept that the crackers wouldn't have paid for the software anyway.

Not everybody can take this kind of zen attitude.  Some people can't sleep at night knowing that somebody somewhere is getting something for nothing.  But try to learn to deal with it.  You can't stop the pirates, but you can balance your time/effort/expense trying to stop all piracy versus making your product better for users.  Remember, sometimes the most pirated applications are also the most popular and profitable.  Good luck and sleep well.I'd suggest you take the pieces of information you want in the key, and hash it with md5, and then just take the first X characters (where X is a key length you think is manageable).

Cryptographically, it's far from perfect, but this is the sort of area where you want to put in the minimum amount of effort which will stop a casual attacker - anything more quickly becomes a black hole.

Oh, I should also point out, you will want to provide the expiration date (and any other information you might want to read out yourself) in plain text (or slightly obfuscated) as part of the key as well if you go down this path - The md5 is just to stop the end user from changing he expiration date to extend the license.

The easiest thing would be a key file like this...

# License key for XYZZY
expiry-date=2009-01-01
other-info=blah
key=[md5 has of MAC address, expiry date, other-info]We've used the following algorithm at my company for years without a single incident.


Decide the fields you want in the code.  Bit-pack as much as possible.  For example, dates could be ""number of days since 2007,"" and then you can get away with 16-bits.
Add an extra ""checksum"" field.  (You'll see why in a second.)  The value of this field is a checksum of the packed bytes from the other fields.  We use ""first 32 bits from MD5.""
Encrypt everything using TEA.  For the key, use something that identifies the customer (e.g. company name + personal email address), that way if someone wants to post a key on the interweb they have to include their own contact info in plain text.
Convert hex to a string in some sensible way.  You can do straight hex digits but some people like to pick a different set of 16 characters to make it less obvious.  Also include dashes or something regularly so it's easier to read it over the phone.


To decrypt, convert hex to string and decrypt with TEA.  But then there's this extra step: Compute your own checksum of the fields (ignoring the checksum field) and compare to the given checksum.  This is the step that ensures no one tampered with the key.

The reason is that TEA mixes the bits completely, so if even one bit is changed, all other bits are equally likely to change during TEA decryption, therefore the checksum will not pass.

Is this hackable?  Of course!  Almost everything is, but this is tight enough and simple to implement.

If tying to contact information is not sufficient, then include a field for ""Node ID"" and lock it to MAC address or somesuch as you suggest.Don't use MAC addresses.  On some hardware we've tested - in particular some IBM Thinkpads - the MAC address can change on a restart.  We didn't bother investigating why this was, but we learned quite early during our research not to rely on it.

Obligatory disclaimer & plug: the company I co-founded produces the OffByZero Cobalt licensing solution.  So it probably won't surprise you to hear that I recommend outsourcing your licensing, & focusing on your core competencies.

Seriously, this stuff is quite tricky to get right, & the consequences of getting it wrong could be quite bad.  If you're low-volume high-price a few pirated copies could seriously dent your revenue, & if you're high-volume low-price then there's incentive for warez d00dz to crack your software for fun & reputation.

One thing to bear in mind is that there is no such thing as truly crack-proof licensing; once someone has your byte-code on their hardware, you have given away the ability to completely control what they do with it. 

What a good licensing system does is raise the bar sufficiently high that purchasing your software is a better option - especially with the rise in malware-infected pirated software.  We recommend you take a number of measures towards securing your application:


get a good third-party licensing system
pepper your code with scope-contained checks (e.g. no one global variable like fIsLicensed, don't check the status of a feature near the code that implements the feature)
employ serious obfuscation in the case of .NET or Java codeThe company I worked for actually used a usb dongle. This was handy because:


Our software was also installed on that USB Stick
The program would only run if it found the (unique) hardware key (any standard USB key has that, so you don't have to buy something special, any stick will do)
it was not restricted to a computer, but could be installed on another system if desired


I know most people don't like dongles, but in this case it was quite handy as it was actually used for a special purpose media player that we also delivered, the USB keys could thus be used as a demo on any pc, but also, and without any modifications, be used in the real application (ie the real players), once the client was satisfiedWe keep it simple: store every license data to an XML (easy to read and manage), create a hash of the whole XML and then crypt it with a utility (also own and simple).

This is also far from perfect, but it can hold for some time.Almost every commercial license system has been cracked, we have used many over the years all eventually get cracked, the general rule is write your own, change it every release, once your happy try to crack it yourself. 

Nothing is really secure, ultimately look at the big players Microsoft etc, they go with the model honest people will pay and other will copy, don't put too much effort into it.

If you application is worth paying money for people will.I've used a number of different products that do the license generation and have created my own solution but it comes down to what will give you the most flexibility now and down the road.

Topics that you should focus on for generating your own license keys are...

HEX formating,  elliptic curve cryptography, and any of the algorithms for encryption such as AES/Rijndael, DES, Blowfish, etc.  These are great for creating license keys.

Of course it isn't enough to have a key you also need to associate it to a product and program the application to lock down based on a key system you've created.

I have messed around with creating my own solution but in the end when it came down to making money with the software I had to cave and get a commercial solution that would save me time in generating keys and managing my product line...  

My favorite so far has been License Vault from SpearmanTech but I've also tried FlexNet (costly), XHEO (way too much programming required), and SeriousBit Ellipter.

I chose the License Vault product in the end because I would get it for much cheaper than the others and it simply had more to offer me as we do most of our work in .NET 3.5.It is difficult to provide a good answer without knowing anything about your product and customers. For enterprise software sold to technical people you can use a fairly complex licensing system and they'll figure it out. For consumer software sold to the barely computer-literate, you need a much simpler system.

In general, I've adopted the practice of making a very simple system that keeps the honest people honest. Anyone who really wants to steal your software will find a way around any DRM system. 

In the past I've used Armadillo (now Software Passport) for C++ projects. I'm currently using XHEO for C# projects.If your product requires the use of the internet, then you can generate a unique id for the machine and use that to check with a license web service.

If it does not, I think going with a commercial product is the way to go.  Yes, they can be hacked, but for the person who is absolutely determined to hack it, it is unlikely they ever would have paid.

We have used: http://www.aspack.com/asprotect.aspx

Software for Sequence Diagrams? [closed],"We don’t allow questions seeking recommendations for books, tools, software libraries, and more. You can edit the question so it can be answered with facts and citations. Closed 5 years ago. I've been using NClass for object/class modeling in class thus far. However, I do not believe that it is capable of sequence diagrams, which is my next task. I would prefer not to use Visio. Is there a good and free software solution for making sequence diagrams?There is www.websequencediagrams.com that is quite cool. I'm having trouble taking it seriously, but it does a really good job at very low effort from my side.Quick Sequence Diagram Editor might suit your needs.  The syntax is strange, but easy to learn.  The thing I like about it is that the diagrams are specified using text files, which makes me happy since I don't like the 'pure visual' approach used by the Visio and Rational tools.  

The example on the official site may look intimidating but the syntax is actually very simple. Here's a hello world example.

hello_world.sd:

c:Config.java

# Put all your Calls between objects here

(source: itmeyer.at)There are also a few other open-source, DSL-based approaches.

The first one (and the one I'd recommend) is mscgen.

mscgen feels like graphviz for sequence diagrams... right down to being supported out of the box by Doxygen and having integration plugins for Sphinx, AsciiDoc, LaTeX, Org-Mode, TWiki, and JIRA)

It's available in the Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Gentoo, Archlinux AUR, FreeBSD FreshPorts, Macports, Homebrew, and Cygwin repositories and Windows binaries are available from the author's website.

There's also mscgen_js, a GPLv3-licensed JavaScript port that claims perfect compatibility with the syntax of the C version in either direction. (It accepts everything mscgen does and, if you want incompatible language extensions, you have to opt into their Xù dialect.)

...plus, mscgen_js supports taking a JSON-encoded AST as input or a language named MsGenny which is to mscgen as Markdown is to HTML and provides genny2msc.js and msc2genny.js scripts for manual conversion)

The second one is called msc-generator and I'm not sure if it has any relationship to mscgen. The syntax is similar but appears subtly different and it has an optional editor GUI. However, it does claim command-line compatibility with mscgen for the purposes of piggybacking on its integration plugins.

It doesn't seem to be in anywhere near as many repositories, but I discovered it via the Archlinux AUR and it has a Windows binary installer.

The last one is UMLGraph. It has a less elegant syntax based on GNU pic2plot macros. (But it can also draw class diagrams using a mix of Java syntax and javadoc tags, if that's your thing.)

UMLGraph is a javadoc doclet, so no compilation is necessary, but it does require javadoc and graphviz. There exist Fedora and openSUSE RPMs but I couldn't find any .debs.For me there are usually about 3 tools I prefer to use.


Netbeans UML Plugin (Its free and its nice)

And since it is integrated in Eclipse you can use it near your code, you can use a lot'of modeling tool also.Umbrello is a fairly comprehensive UML modelling tool.

Software for sensor manipulation,"I am searching for open source software for wireless sensors’ management in a wireless sensor network environment. More specifically, I have some 802.11-based temperature sensors which are connected with a pc using a 802.11 router. I need to put configurable open source software into the pc to manipulate the information that comes from the sensors. Any idea?I've been using Zenoss Core Community edition to accomplish the task you mentioned. It allows you to monitor several temperature sensors, storing the information in circular databases. Once deployed, you don't need to perform too much housekeeping. 

If your sensors implements SNMP (Simple Network Managment Protocol) all you need is to enable the protocol according to manufacturer specs and let zenoss to discover your devices. 

You can create customized reports and trigger events based on your custom configuration (eg, send an email when temperature is over certain level).

Finally, if the monitoring info is retrieved using a different method other than SNMP,  you can code custom scripts with Python, so that you help to zenoss to retrieve the info needed. Dig into the forums. Chances are the script is already available for your sensor.",,,,,1,192,81.6,77.88,23.08,20.23,17.45,30.21,77.6,55.73,45.31,9.9,7.81,2.08,0,5.73,0,0,2.08,15.1,7.81,2.08,11.98,6.77,3.65,3.65,0.52,15.1,4.17,3.65,4.17,1.04,1.04,2.08,16.67,0.52,16.15,3.13,5.21,3.13,2.08,0,3.13,0,2.08,1.04,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.42,3.13,0.52,0,0,0,1.04,6.77,0,0,0,0,4.69,0,0,4.69,3.65,0,0,3.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.08,0,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,2.08,3.65,7.29,1.04,1.04,5.73,0,0,0,2.08,2.08,5.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.1,6.77,3.65,0.52,0,1.56,2.6,
Software install automation,"I work at a computer software installation center - our users run Windows. Some of the software is difficult to install for new employees. I would like to automate the setup of software using either Python or Java.  How should I fill in the information in the setup dialogs and moving through the setup process automatically?---- Edited as the solution is obviously talking about Windows / MSI ----

MSI supports the passing of configuration parameters on the command line.  Look into it.  Unless they are doing something truly exotic, or they packaged the program in a way that purposefully ignores the parameters, you might find that the best solution is just to put the parameters on the command line during your chained install.

---- Original post follows ----

First, you need to know what kind of systems you are installing software on.

Then you need to select the package management system that is the default for that system, on Windows it is MSI, many Linux systems use RPM (some use deb), etc.

Then you need to look at remote installation.  Nearly every modern package manager supports one technique or another of remote installation.  Depending on the package manager, this might involve push solutions (drop the package with configuration information into a directory or send it using an interface), while others are managed with a pull solution.

If using a pull solution, install a daily job to pull from a specific resource, and then you can convert the system to a pull solution (which generally makes management a bit easier).

Later on, you may want to look at more inclusive solutions, such as how to install additions to base software during the installation process.  Again it's different for each operating system you intend to support.I used pywinauto to automate GUIs, which should also work well for installation forms.If you want to automate dialog completions on Windows, AutoIt is the way to go. Excellent documentation and support, a powerful but readable scripting language, support for custom GUI creation and script compilation, etc

Software interrupt,"How can I program software interrupt in C? I know need to write an interrupt servicing routine and then interrupt the CPU so that the routine can be called, but I don't know how to do that in C. Also, I don't know how to register that routine with Interrupt descriptor table.
I have an x86-64 CPU (AMD Turion64 X2) and I am using gcc compiler.
Any help would be appreciated.The concept of interrupts is not included in the C specification (and is also somewhat processor specific). Most compilers, including GCC, let you write inline assembly code (or you can of course link a file written in assembly to your program). But the big problem is that common operating systems (especially those running in 64-bit mode) will not let you alter the interrupt table. I guess your best bet is to look for a simple open source OS and either install your interrupt handler from a normal program (if the OS allows it) or add your code to the kernel. The reason why you can't just run a small piece of code in a processor simulator (or virtual machine) is that the processor needs quite a bit of setup to get into 64-bit mode. And the exact details about how you alter the interrupt table depends on that setup.The operating system hides real interrupts from applications. As far as I know it isn't possible unless you are running in the kernel layer (ring 0?)writting ISR is not a matter of Language. yes you can do it in C.

Its a matter of Understanding of your OS Kernel, about routines that are called to register your ISR on a certain interrupt line with GIC or other interrupt controllers and make an Entry in Interrupt Descriptor table .
Like with Linux on ARM .. Its request_irq() to register an ISR with IRQ contoller and make an entry in IRQ_DESC table.

So will suggest first check ISR framework of your respective OS.Use sigaction. See man 2 sigaction.

To cause the interrupt, use raise or kill.",,,,,1,346,71.04,35.11,30.55,23.89,19.22,20.52,82.66,62.72,49.71,10.12,6.36,2.31,0,4.05,0,0,3.76,14.74,8.38,2.31,13.01,7.23,4.34,6.94,2.02,15.03,5.49,2.02,2.31,0.29,0.29,1.73,18.5,0.29,17.92,3.76,4.34,2.31,3.76,0.87,4.91,0,0.87,0.58,0.29,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,12.14,7.8,0.58,0.29,0.29,0,2.31,4.34,0,0,0,0.29,1.45,0,0,1.45,4.05,0,0,3.76,0.29,0,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.58,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0.29,1.16,4.91,6.94,0.87,1.16,4.34,1.16,0,0,1.16,1.16,5.78,0.58,0.29,0,0.29,0,0,15.61,6.07,1.73,0.58,0,1.16,6.07,

Software interrupt on network traffic [closed],"On my computer there is 3G, Wifi and LAN port. I would like to build a linux software to show green color if there is network traffic and red color for no network traffic.

TCPDUMP could provide the real time statistics but it would generate high CPU load. Therefore I wonder if I could get the real time statistics via software interrupt? Whenever there is network traffic a software interrupt will be generated.

Thanks in advance
I don't know whether you'd call this a software interrupt, but you could consult the following example. (The third argument to poll() is the time in milliseconds after which the network is considered inactive.)

Software interrupts in C? [closed],"Questions asking for code must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved. Include attempted solutions, why they didn't work, and the expected results. See also: Stack Overflow question checklist Closed 8 years ago. I have understand the concepts of software interrupt and hardware interrupts theoretically but anyone could give me an example for software interrupt and explain it ?? Please it would be a great help for me. C program example for windows or Linux operating systemInterrupts are handled by the operating system kernel. Applications don't see them (because the kernel processes all interrupts so hides them from applications). On Linux, application processes see signals. See signal(7) and read Advanced Linux Programming.

Notice that the C11 standard (on the C programming language) don't know about interrupts.

Please understand that signals are not interrupts (and Linux applications don't see directly any interrupts, except by measuring them thru proc(5), see file /proc/interrupts). And signal handlers have strong restrictions: only async-signal-safe functions ca be called (directly or indirectly) from a signal handler. Often, setting a volatile sig_atomic_t flag is sensible in your signal handler, and your application should test it elsewhere.

If you have an event loop (e.g. around poll(2) etc...) using the Linux specific signalfd(2) could be very convenient.

So when programming a Linux application (and probably also a Windows one) you don't care about interrupts (but you might handle some signals). BTW, a Linux kernel typically sees hundreds (or perhaps thousands) of interrupts each second, and wake up some driver and/or reschedule some task for most of them. A given Linux application process usually handles much less than one signal per second (but YMMV).",,,,,1,282,49.68,28.37,15,35.29,15.67,30.14,80.14,58.87,46.81,6.74,4.61,1.06,0,1.77,0,1.77,2.13,13.12,6.38,4.26,8.51,7.45,6.38,8.87,2.13,15.6,3.9,5.32,2.13,0.35,1.06,0.71,18.09,0.35,17.38,4.26,1.42,1.77,6.03,0,4.61,0,1.77,1.42,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.64,6.74,1.06,0.71,0,0,1.42,3.9,0,0,0,0,1.77,0,0,1.77,7.09,0,0.71,6.03,0,0.35,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0.35,0.71,0,0.35,0,4.61,5.67,0.35,0,2.48,2.84,0,0,1.77,2.48,3.19,0.71,0.71,0.71,0,0,0,25.53,7.45,3.19,0.71,0,1.77,12.41,
Software keyboard resizes background image on Android,"Whenever the software keyboard appears, it resizes the background image. Refer to the screenshot below: As you can see, the background is sort of squeezed. Anyone can shed a light on why the background resizes? My Layout is as follows:Ok I fixed it by using 

android:windowSoftInputMode=""stateVisible|adjustPan""


entry inside <Activity > tag in manifest file. I think it was caused by having ScrollView inside the Activity.I faced the same problem while developing a chat app, chat screen with a background image. android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustResize"" squeezed my background image to fit the available space after the soft keyboard was displayed and ""adjustPan"" shifted the whole layout up to adjust the soft keyboard.
The solution to this problem was setting the window background instead of a layout background inside an activity XML. Use getWindow().setBackgroundDrawable() in your activity.Here is the best solution to avoid such kind of problem.

Step 1: Create a style

<style name=""ChatBackground"" parent=""AppBaseTheme"">
    <item name=""android:windowBackground"">@drawable/bg_chat</item>
</style>


Step 2: Set your activity style in the AndroidManifest file

<activity
    android:name="".Chat""
    android:screenOrientation=""portrait""
    android:theme=""@style/ChatBackground"" >Through  android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustPan""  giving bad user experience because through that entire screen goes on top (shift to top ) So, following is one of the best answeres.

I have same Problem  but after that , i Found Awesome answeres from the @Gem

In Manifest

android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustResize|stateAlwaysHidden""


In xml

Dont Set any background here and keep your view under ScrollView

In Java

You need to set the background to window:

    getWindow().setBackgroundDrawableResource(R.drawable.bg_wood) ;


Thanks to @Gem.just for addition...

if u have a listview on your activity
u need to add this android:isScrollContainer=""false"" in your listview properties...

and don't forget to add android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustPan"" in your manifest xml at your activity...

if you guys using android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustUnspecified"" with scrollable view on your layout, then your background will still resized by the soft keyboard...

it would be better if you use ""adjustPan"" value to prevent your background from resizing...In case if somebody need an adjustResize behavior and don't want his ImageView to be resized here is another workaround.

Just put ImageView inside ScrollView => RelativeLayout with ScrollView.fillViewport = true.

<ScrollView
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:fillViewport=""true"">

    <RelativeLayout
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content"">

        <FrameLayout
            android:layout_width=""100dp""
            android:layout_height=""100dp"">

            <ImageView
                android:layout_width=""match_parent""
                android:layout_height=""match_parent""
                android:scaleType=""fitXY""
                android:src=""@drawable/gift_checked"" />

        </FrameLayout>
    </RelativeLayout>
</ScrollView>After studying and implementing all available answers, here I am adding a solution.

https://stackoverflow.com/a/27702210/1164529

Here is the custom AppCompatImageView class which showed no stretching or scrolling w.r.t. soft keyboard:-

public class TopCropImageView extends AppCompatImageView {

    public TopCropImageView(Context context) {
        super(context);
        setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.MATRIX);
    }

    public TopCropImageView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
        setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.MATRIX);
    }

    public TopCropImageView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) {
        super(context, attrs, defStyle);
        setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.MATRIX);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int left, int top, int right, int bottom) {
        super.onLayout(changed, left, top, right, bottom);
        computeMatrix();
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean setFrame(int l, int t, int r, int b) {
        computeMatrix();
        return super.setFrame(l, t, r, b);
    }


    private void computeMatrix() {
        if (getDrawable() == null) return;
        Matrix matrix = getImageMatrix();
        float scaleFactor = getWidth() / (float) getDrawable().getIntrinsicWidth();
        matrix.setScale(scaleFactor, scaleFactor, 0, 0);
        setImageMatrix(matrix);
    }
}


To use it as background to my Fragment class, I set it as first element to FrameLayout.

<FrameLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent"">

    <complete.package.TopCropImageView
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""
        android:src=""@mipmap/my_app_background"" />

    <!-- Enter other UI elements here to overlay them on the background image -->

<FrameLayout>I suffered similar issues, but it seems like using adjustPan with android:isScrollContainer=""false"" still didn't fix my layout (which was a RecyclerView below a LinearLayout). The RecyclerView was fine, but every time the virtual keyboard showed up, the LinearLayout re-adjusted.

To prevent this behavior (I simply wanted to have the keyboard go over my layout), I went with the following code:

    <activity
        android:name="".librarycartridge.MyLibraryActivity""
        android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustNothing"" />


This tells Android to basically leave your layout alone when the virtual keyboard is called.

More reading about possible options can be found here (though oddly enough, it doesn't seem like there's an entry for adjustNothing).Add this line in AndroidManifest.xml file:

android:windowSoftInputMode=adjustUnspecified


refer to this link for more info.I faced with this problem, when my background image was just a ImageView inside a Fragment, and it was resized by the keyboard. 

My solution was: using custom ImageView from this SO Answer, edited to be compatible with androidx.

import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Matrix;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import androidx.appcompat.widget.AppCompatImageView;

/**
 * Created by chris on 7/27/16.

public class TopCropImageView extends AppCompatImageView {

    public TopCropImageView(Context context) {
        super(context);
        setScaleType(ScaleType.MATRIX);
    }

    public TopCropImageView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
        setScaleType(ScaleType.MATRIX);
    }

    public TopCropImageView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) {
        super(context, attrs, defStyle);
        setScaleType(ScaleType.MATRIX);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int left, int top, int right, int bottom) {
        super.onLayout(changed, left, top, right, bottom);
        recomputeImgMatrix();
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean setFrame(int l, int t, int r, int b) {
        recomputeImgMatrix();
        return super.setFrame(l, t, r, b);
    }

    private void recomputeImgMatrix() {
        if (getDrawable() == null) return;

        final Matrix matrix = getImageMatrix();

        float scale;
        final int viewWidth = getWidth() - getPaddingLeft() - getPaddingRight();
        final int viewHeight = getHeight() - getPaddingTop() - getPaddingBottom();
        final int drawableWidth = getDrawable().getIntrinsicWidth();
        final int drawableHeight = getDrawable().getIntrinsicHeight();

        if (drawableWidth * viewHeight > drawableHeight * viewWidth) {
            scale = (float) viewHeight / (float) drawableHeight;
        } else {
            scale = (float) viewWidth / (float) drawableWidth;
        }

        matrix.setScale(scale, scale);
        setImageMatrix(matrix);
    }

}My solution is to substitute the background of the window with the one of the layout, then set the layout background to null. In this way I keep the image in the XML preview window:

So keep the background in the layout and add an id for it. 
Then in the activity onCreate() put this code:

    ConstraintLayout mainLayout = (ConstraintLayout)findViewById(R.id.mainLayout);
    getWindow().setBackgroundDrawable(mainLayout.getBackground());
    mainLayout.setBackground(null);Just add in your activity

getWindow().setBackgroundDrawable(R.drawable.your_image_name);I faced this same problem before but no solution worked for me so long because i was using a Fragment, and also
getActivity().getWindow().setBackgroundDrawable()  was not a solution for me.

Solution which worked for me is to override FrameLayout with a logic to handle keyboard which should appear and change the bitmap on the go. 

Here is my FrameLayout code (Kotlin):

class FlexibleFrameLayout : FrameLayout {

    var backgroundImage: Drawable? = null
        set(bitmap) {
            field = bitmap
            invalidate()
        }
    private var keyboardHeight: Int = 0
    private var isKbOpen = false

    private var actualHeight = 0

    constructor(context: Context) : super(context) {
        init()
    }

    constructor(context: Context, attributeSet: AttributeSet) : super(context, attributeSet) {
        init()
    }

    fun init() {
        setWillNotDraw(false)
    }

    override fun onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec: Int, heightMeasureSpec: Int) {
        super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec)
        val height = MeasureSpec.getSize(heightMeasureSpec)
        if (actualHeight == 0) {
            actualHeight = height
            return
        }
        //kb detected
        if (actualHeight - height > 100 && keyboardHeight == 0) {
            keyboardHeight = actualHeight - height
            isKbOpen = true
        }
        if (actualHeight - height < 50 && keyboardHeight != 0) {
            isKbOpen = false
        }
        if (height != actualHeight) {
            invalidate()
        }
    }

    override fun onDraw(canvas: Canvas) {
        if (backgroundImage != null) {
            if (backgroundImage is ColorDrawable) {
                backgroundImage!!.setBounds(0, 0, measuredWidth, measuredHeight)
                backgroundImage!!.draw(canvas)
            } else if (backgroundImage is BitmapDrawable) {
                val scale = measuredWidth.toFloat() / backgroundImage!!.intrinsicWidth.toFloat()
                val width = Math.ceil((backgroundImage!!.intrinsicWidth * scale).toDouble()).toInt()
                val height = Math.ceil((backgroundImage!!.intrinsicHeight * scale).toDouble()).toInt()
                val kb = if (isKbOpen) keyboardHeight else 0
                backgroundImage!!.setBounds(0, 0, width, height)
                backgroundImage!!.draw(canvas)
            }
        } else {
            super.onDraw(canvas)
        }
    }
}


And I used it as like an usual FrameLayout's background.

frameLayout.backgroundImage = Drawable.createFromPath(path)

Hope it helps.You can wrap your LinearLayout with FrameLayout and add ImageView with Background:

<FrameLayout>

  <ImageView 
    android:background=""@drawable/page_bg""
    android:id=""@+id/backgroundImage"" />

  <LinearLayout>
    ....
  </LinearLayout>
</FrameLayout>


And You can set it height when you creating activity/fragment (to prevent from scaling when open keyboard). Some code in Kotlin from Fragment:

activity?.window?.decorView?.height?.let {
        backgroundImage.setHeight(it)
}if you are set image as windowbackground and ui going to stuck. then there may be possibility you are uses drawable which is in single drawable folder,
if yes then you have to paste it in drawable-nodpi or drawable-xxxhdpi.I encountered the main problem when working on my app. At first, I use the method provided by @parulb to solve the problem. Thank him a lot. But later I noticed that the background image is partially hided by actionbar (and statusbar I am sure). This small issue is already proposed by @zgc7009 who commented below the answer of @parulb one year and a half ago but no one replied.

I worked a whole day to find out a way and fortunately I can at least solve this problem perfectly on my cellphone now. 

First we need a layer-list resource in drawable folder to add padding on the top to the background image:

<!-- my_background.xml -->
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>

<layer-list
    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
    <item android:top=""75dp"">
        <bitmap android:src=""@drawable/bg"" />
    </item>
</layer-list>


Second we set this file as resource for background as mentioned above:

getWindow().setBackgroundDrawableResource(R.drawable.my_background);


I am using Nexus 5. I found a way to get height of actionbar in xml but not the statusbar, so I have to use a fixed height 75dp for top padding.

Software licencing scheme [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 7 years ago. I plan to use asymetric crypto so as to send a message from 1 server (the licence server) to n clients (the n computers on which the software is installed) The client sends (via mail, for example) some informations about the computer (MAC address, machine name, you name it) On the licence server, these informations are encrypted using a well secured public (not so public) RSA key, this encrypted payload is the licence. the encrypted licence is sent to the clientWhen the software is launched, it cheks for a licence file, it is able to ensure the payload was encrypted with the server key, using the corresponding RSA private key, shipped with each version of the software. Once the licence decrypted, the software checks it's running on the same machine the licence was given to. In my opinion, no one will be able to forge an encrypted payload without access to the Licence server RSA key. Of course, the licence might be stolen, then the software launched in a virtual machine which mimics a genuine client machine, or the software might be disassembled so as to unplug the licence check. But is this scheme good enough, or am I utterly naive in this regard? ThanksIt's a decent scheme, although are you sure you want the client to have the private key and the server the public key? Unless you're generating one keypair per install, shouldn't it be the other way around?

The scheme is simple, but is it practical? If your goal is to prevent casual cracking of your application there are simpler solutions that are just as effective. And if your goal is to prevent crackers from running your application, chances are that (a) you won't succeed and (b) your program isn't important enough to merit such attention.

And why would someone seek to attack the cryptography part of the license scheme when simply hex-editing the binary to change the license checking code to NOPs will almost certainly work just fine?

Software license validation,"I am working on a software license related task , the current validation method requires an online check, against the company server  , but since the users can manipulate there system clocks and continue using the software in offline mode , i have been assigned to look for a way to do offline validation clock checks using java , I know there are no bullet proof ways to do this but can anyone please suggest a way to make it hard using an expired license in offline mode . thank youHave the software know the earliest possible date (based on when that version went into production). If the clock is prior to that date, deny access until the online check succeeds. This requires storing this additional state (that the app is locked out) somewhere on the filesystem. You will probably want to have the app be ""locked"" if the file is missing to prevent someone from resetting the state simply by removing the file.

Also, when the license check succeeds (either online or offline), note the time. Deny any future access that is prior to that time and deny access until the online check succeeds. This forces time to march forward and if they mess up with their clock re-setting then they are locked out until they succeed with an online check.

When the license check succeeds online, store the server timestamp on the client (the timestamp that is used above to keep time moving forward).

Obviously, you will want to protect the contents of the file that persists this state, e.g., using encryption.

Software process models [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 5 years ago. What's the difference between process models and approaches.
In Ian Sommerville's Software Engineering book,
Software processes categorized in to Plan-Driven and Agile.
Then he talks about 3 models, Waterfall, Incremental and Reuse-oriented.
Then he talk about Rational unified process and then it comes a topic about Boehm spiral model. Is this Boehm spiral model a another type of software process model as Waterfall, Incremental and Reuse-oriented? Then in Agile software development, he's talking about RAD (Rapid Application Development) is this also a process model? 
Can we categorize software process models in to the 2 processes (i.e Plan driven and agile)?A process or method, in this context, is a set of steps that produce a software product.

A process model is a generic description of a category of processes.

So, waterfall, incremental, and reuse-oriented are all categories of processes.   There are potentially several processes that fall into each category.

A spiral model is another category, which is generally concerned with managing certain developmental risks.    Barry Boehm was the first author who described a spiral model (and he described it as a ""process model"") and his description is labelled as Boehm's Spiral Model by subsequent authors.

In practice, there is nothing stopping someone from developing a process that draws features from a number of process models.   It is then a bit of a philosophical (sometimes almost religious) discussion as to whether such a process fits into multiple categories, or in its own category.

RAD is also described as a process model, although the term is sometimes (e.g. by James Martin) applied to particular processes.   So, depending on who you ask, RAD is either a particular development process or a category of development process.

Some authors do use the terms ""process"" and ""process model"" interchangeably (RAD being either a process or a process model, depending on who you ask, is an example) which muddies the water even further.",,,,,1,340,70.62,36.69,36.2,23.96,17,33.24,70.29,55.59,48.53,9.12,3.53,0.29,0.29,0.59,1.47,0,5.59,15,8.82,1.47,12.06,6.18,5,9.71,0.29,8.82,4.41,3.24,1.76,0.59,0.88,0.29,11.47,0.59,10.88,1.76,0.88,0.59,4.12,0,4.41,0,0.59,0.29,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.35,3.82,0,0,0,0,3.82,3.53,0,0,0,1.47,2.06,0,0,2.06,2.35,0,0,2.06,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0,0.59,7.35,0.29,1.47,6.18,0,0,0,4.12,0.88,6.18,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,20,5.88,5.29,1.18,0,1.18,6.47,

If you still get false positives, ask the AV companies giving false positives to white list your program. They will usually white list your certificate.It's pretty much in the nature of the app, but I don't see what the issue is. You should be downloading as an installer of some kind anyway. There's lots of poor antivirus programs out there and most are worthless anyway, the only way to fix it is to individually contact the antivirus companies but if it's in an installer it should not get pickup up on anyway.Look for protector supporting IEEE Taggants System developed for especially that purpose.

If it can be read by your program, then it can be read by another program.I run a software company that has dealt with this issue for nearly 20 years.  As both a developer and a business owner, I'd like to first encourage you to broaden your goals a bit. For example, it is simply a mistake to define your problem as ""preventing piracy.""  Your goal should be to maximize revenue.

With that being said, there are some people who simply will never buy your software but who may make fairly significant efforts to get it for free.  It isn't ""fair"" that they get a free copy but placing a lot of resources into the effort to prevent it is largely a waste of time.  Indeed, these folks often end up ""going legit"" simply to get on our update list, to get support or because their business evolves to the point where they can now afford our license.  In these cases, the original piracy ends up enhancing our revenue.  

So, how do we license? 

We generate a random license number with each new install (a number between 10K and 99K does nicely).  We then have an algorithm for generating a matching number (anything non-trivial will do). We use a random number, by the way, so that any attempt reinstall on another computer results in different license/match numbers.

Next, we ask users to call us on the phone to get the matching number for their license (this is important).  The software looks at the matching number they enter and compares it to the matching value generated on the user's side.  If there is a match, the software is fully activated.

I say that having them phone us is important because we use that as an opportunity to talk with them about their setup, answer any questions, and let them know they are dealing with real people. Very few people have the nerve to try calling and impersonating another company (we look them up and compare their information to our purchase database).  Note that our package runs nearly $2K so phone calls are reasonable.  If your package costs less and has higher volume, you could do this via email. Finally, we use the call-in to tell users how to get upgrades and technical support with their new license.

Finally, we store the key in the application's database (a locally-installed MSDE/SQL Express database) so that any attempt to copy the app will A) be non-trivial and B) bring over a lot of data specific to the organization that first bought the legitimate version (making them less likely to share).  The licensing key is encrypted and ""split"" into two different keys that are kept in two different tables.  Thus, a simple ""find the key and enter it in the pirated version"" will not work.

The bottom line? When you make the entire package more than just the software, build in a few basic protective mechanisms, and introduce the human element, you should see that you don't need the expense and trouble of a dongle to maximize revenue.The absolute answer is, of course, that a determined and skillful attacker can break any protection, but, especially for software which is not in a high level of demand or fame, skillful and determined attackers are rare, so taking protective measures makes sense.

To validate a license, sending the key to a central location is the safest way, because they'd have to crack your server (or protocol, watch out) to be able to validate. That'd require connectivity to use the software which may or may not be feasible. You could also distribute a 'license server' along with your software for big installs that'd require only local network access. If you can't and have to validate locally only, you could write a dll in native code that'd make it harder to reverse engineer.

To protect the code itself, and make its protection harder to bypass, obfuscate:

What's the best value for money c# code protection for a single developer


All in all, you might get a better value out of a packaged solution.I read an through an interesting presentation about how skype approaches the task of protecting software by encryption.And this is why Copy Protection and 'keeping honest users honest' is a losing battle. You don't need to keep honest users honest, they already are.  

The majority of effective Copy Protection schemes these days center around doing occasional key-checks against a central server. Have the application check it's key against the central server every so often, and you can determine if the software is licensed correctly. I'm over simplifying things a lot, obviously, but that is one approach.Basically, you will need to use a commercial solution. The approach here is different from a dongle, and you cannot expect to simply replicate a dongle.

Instead, the main solution is to use some kind of key that is calculated in part from things about the computer that is running the software. Keygens that do the same thing can be made by crackers, but so it goes. They could have simply patched your software to not look for a dongle.My recommendation is, if it's livable, stick with the dongle. Those tend to be the most viable approaches.

If it's not an option, then definitely go to an outside provider. You'll be looking for, among other things, a few key features (no pun intended):


Secure storage of the key
License checking
Compile-time obfuscation (to make it harder to disassemble your app)


None of this is sure-fire. The bottom line is that developers have been fighting piracy for a long time, and we always lose when the pirates are determined enough. If your main goal is to keep honest people honest, then a decent commercial software protection package will probably do so for you.Whilst nothing is going to be perfect, check out the CryptProtectData API if you want to do it yourself.

To be honest though, you are likely in for less headaches just buying a solution.If you store the key on the users local computer a cracker will be able to acess it no matter how hard you try to prevent this.

Why not store either the key or a crucial part of the copy protection code remotely and maybe process it remotely?Generate the hash (SHA1, MD5, etc) for a key and hardcode the hash in your application. Distribute the key to your users. In your executable can check the hash of the user specified key against the hardcoded hash:

bool CheckKey(string keyFromUser) 
   return SHA1(key) == ""ABC2983CF293892CD298392FG"";
}


This means that anyone that can get hold of the key from your organization (or another user) can run the application, It will practically difficult to determine the key by inspecting the executable.

This is obviously not a very strong protection.In general, software on a non-networked machine can be cracked. If your application is non-niche enough that pirates can sell cracked copies of it, you are going to see that out there. One solution I've heard of that apparently was successful is self-modifying code.You could try standard methods usually used in PC Games such as: SafeDisc,StarForce,SecuROM or any other  copy protection software. These systems are among the most developed software systems to protected your application.

Nonetheless the experience tells that no only-software protection system is unbreakable and the time taken to hackers to break them is directly proportional to the worth of the protected content. No matter how advanced a protection system has ben used to prevent pirated copies of a popular game, the crack awaits a few months ahead.

You have stated that license server is a trouble for your system, but I wouldn't drop it right away. I think a license server, that issues a license  at least the first program run (say a decrypt key different per installation) is the best deterrent measure to reduce piracy. Not only by the the strength of the encryption method but also and mainly because of the automatic registration system. If you let your customers know that the software activation key is unique per installation/user and that it is stored and matched to user's profile they would think twice about giving away the key+software.Please let me add some thoughts to Your question:


Does Your software require any kind of internet connectivity?


If the answer is ""yes"", You can monitor the usage. (Do tell the customer about this functionality!)
If the answer is ""no"", You still can monitor the usage in most cases, but You cannot enforce a connection to Your servers for the product to work.

Do You want to add copy-protection to Your software? This is no rhetorical question, because


some software has to be customized by the software company or its partners. If anyone makes a copy of software, that has to be customized by experts, it just won't be of any use for him.
e.g. if an employee of Your customer wants to use Your high-end circuit-design software for his private projects at home and You give him the permission to do so, then You have someone at Your customers site, who will vote for Your product on every purchase decision.
the effort for a working copy protection could be higher than the loss created by unauthorized copies. (Remember, You can still include it in the next version.)Is this data simply commerical stuff or things you share with workers and so fort?

If it is the latter, perhaps you can write a quick c++ program to xor it. Basically if the key length is equal to the length of the document, it should be ""unbreakable."" What I do in c++ is create a buffer of random chars of the size of the document, then xor it, then simply send the document and key file seperately and then the other person xor them together to get back the document.

Software quality metrics [closed],"Questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, library or favorite off-site resource are off-topic for Stack Overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it. Closed 9 years ago. I was wondering if anyone has experience in metrics used to measure software quality. I know there are code complexity metrics but I'm wondering if there is a specific way to measure how well it actually performs during it's lifetime. I don't mean runtime performance, but rather a measure of the quality. Any suggested tools that would help gather these are welcome too. Is there measurements to answer these questions: Seems like most of this would need to be closely tied with a CM and bug reporting tool.If measuring code quality in the terms you put it would be such a straightforward job and the metrics accurate, there would probably be no need for Project Managers anymore. Even more, the distinction between good and poor managers would be very small. Because it isn't, that just shows that getting an accurate idea about the quality of your software, is no easy job.

Your questions span to multiple areas that are quantified differently or are very subjective to quantification, so you should group these into categories that correspond to common targets. Then you can assign an ""importance"" factor to each category and derive some metrics from that.

For instance you could use static code analysis tools for measuring the syntactic quality of your code and derive some metrics from that.

You could also derive metrics from bugs/lines of code using a bug tracking tool integrated with a version control system. 

For measuring robustness, reuse and efficiency of the coding process you could evaluate the use of design patterns per feature developed (of course where it makes sense). There's no tool that will help you achieve this, but if you monitor your software growing bigger and put numbers on these it can give you a pretty good idea of how you project is evolving and if it's going in the right direction. Introducing code-review procedures could help you keep track of these easier and possibly address them early in the development process. A number to put on these could be the percentage of features implemented using the  appropriate design patterns.

While metrics can be quite abstract and subjective, if you dedicate time to it and always try to improve them, it can give you useful information.

A few things to note about metrics in the software process though:


Unless you do them well, metrics could prove to be more harm than good.
Metrics are difficult to do well.
You should be cautious in using metrics to rate individual performance or offering bonus schemes. Once you do this everyone will try to cheat the system and your metrics will prove worthless.If you are using Ruby, there are some tools to help you out with metrics ranging from LOCs/Method and Methods/Class Saikuros Cyclomatic complexity.

My boss actually held a presentation on software metric we use at a ruby conference last year, these are the slides.

A interesting tool that brings you a lot of metrics at once is metric_fu. It checks alot of interesting aspects of your code. Stuff that is highly similar, changes a lot, has a lot of branches. All signs your codes could be better :)

I imagine there are lot more tools like this for other languages too.There is a good thread from the old Joel on Software Discussion groups about this.I know that some SVN stat programs provide an overview over changed lines per submit. If you have a bugtracking system and persons fixing bugs adding features etc are stating their commit number when the bug is fixed you can then calculate how many line were affected by each bug/new feature request. This could give you a measurement of changeability.

The next thing is simply count the number of bugs found and set them in ratio to the number of code lines. There are some values how many bugs a high quality software should have per codeline.You could do it in some economic way or in programmer's way.

In case of economic way you mesaure costs of improving code, fixing bugs, adding new features and so on. If you choose the second way, you may want to measure how much staff works with your program and how easy it is to, say, find and fix an average bug in human hours. Certainly they are not flawless, because costs depend on the market situation and human hours depend on the actual people and their skills, so it's better to combine both methods.

This way you get some instruments to mesaure quality of your code. Of course you should take into account the size of your project and other factors, but I hope main idea is clear.A more customer focused metric would be the average time it takes for the software vendor to fix bugs and implement new features.

It is very easy to calculate, based on your bug tracking software's date created, and closed information.

If your average bug fixing/feature implementation time is extremely high, this could also be an indicator for bad software quality.You may want to check the following page describing various different aspects of software quality including sample plots. Some of the quality characteristics you require to measure can be derived using tool such as Sonar. It is very important to figure out how would you want to model some of the following aspects:


Maintainability: You did mention about how easy is it to change/test the code or reuse the code. These are related with testability and re-usability aspect of maintainability which is considered to be key software quality characteristic. Thus, you could measure maintainability as a function of testability (unit test coverage) and re-usability (cohesiveness index of the code).
Defects: Defects alone may not be a good idea to measure. However, if you can model defect density, it could give you a good picture.",,,,,1,1027,50.32,75.86,16.51,58.34,22.82,23.66,81.69,66.21,53.65,11.59,6.43,0.78,0.19,4.67,0,0.78,5.16,13.83,6.13,0.39,12.07,9.83,6.04,6.52,0.68,16.26,5.65,6.04,2.73,0.78,1.27,0.78,17.04,0.58,16.46,4.38,2.73,3.7,3.51,1.07,3.8,0,3.99,3.21,0.78,0.88,0.78,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,9.93,2.82,0.39,0.19,0.1,0.39,0.97,6.82,0,0,0,0,1.17,0,0,1.17,4.38,0,0,3.8,0.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.39,0.49,0.1,0.19,0,0.1,0.19,0.49,4.38,5.84,0.39,0.49,4.48,0.19,0,0.1,2.53,1.46,5.84,0.78,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,11.39,5.06,3.02,0,0,0.88,2.43,
Software rendering concept (boundary between software renderer and gpu),"Software renderer must communicate (in such or other way)with GPU at least  when he write image data in framebuffer. If i will additionaly using gpgpu for calculations is my renderer still be ""Software"" or not? Where is the boundary between pure ""Software"" renderer and GPU Renderer? Wikipedia said that: In the context of rendering (computer graphics), software rendering refers to a rendering process that is unaided by any specialized graphics hardware, such as a graphics card. Does it mean that the only work that software renderer can send to GPU is framebuffer filling otherwise it will be not pure ""Software""?I would say the boundary is where you use the actual graphics-related functionality of the hardware (and thus the actual ""specialized graphics hardware"", like texture filtering, rasterization, ...) to your advantage in contrast to the mere GP GPU features of data-parallel processing that you can (to a lesser degree, of course) find in any multi-core processor. Of course in the end everything is done on hardware, but just porting some algorithm onto the GPU, without using the GPU's graphics-related hardware facilities doesn't magically make it hardware-accelerated rendering, even if the algorithm itself is related to rendering.

Of course this is a more subjective answer (to a rather philosophical and off-topic question in the first place) and I guess the boundary is pretty loose.

Software scaling for parallel processing,"I have a question about software scaling.
Is there any kind of programming language to program parallel processing algorithms with software scaling Or is software scaling a kind of algorithm and can be programmed with any kind of languages ?Scaling meaning the ability of your system to be expanded (increase number of processing units) at a large scale to accommodate the increase in the data size. 


  Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work in a capable manner or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. For example, it can refer to the capability of a system to increase its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added. An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an economic context, where scalability of a company implies that the underlying business model offers the potential for economic growth within the company.


Parallel Programming on the other hand is writing code of your algorithm in away able to run in multi-processing system or machine, to take advantage of the n processing elements that are withen the systems.

There are many parallel programming frameworks written in different programming languages: for example there is CUDA written by NVIDIA in C/C++, and OpenCL in both C/C++ and python , MPI ,OpenMP , Intel Thread Block and Intel Cilk. each has its advantage and usage over the other.

Software structure versus Software architecture [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 8 years ago. I can't get the precise differences between software structure and software architecture A simple example explains the precise differences would be very appreciated BTW,I use UML for representing architectureSoftware architecture and Software structure overlap between them.

Software architecture is a set of important aspects and decisions in relation to a software system (simply said). It includes the most important requirements and all kind of restrictions (performance, security, etc.), then the high-level system organization, the principal communication mechanisms between the system parts, external dependencies, implementation technologies and guidlines, even risks, etc, etc, etc.

I read once a great statement about the software architecture: it's a set of decisions, which are hard to change.

So, when you are not sure if an aspect/decision is really architectonic relevant, just ask yourself - if I later change this aspect/decision, what is the impact? How hard it to change it?

Examples:


Let's say we want to change the client-server system structure to 3-Tier. How hard is this restructuring? Well, probably pretty hard. Therefore is this an architectonic aspect.
we want to change the communication between XML and JSON. This could be very complicated if not well designed, so we treat this with care and as an architectonic req.
What if we want to change a sorting algorithm in a method. This change is likely to be localized and not very costly. Therefore, it's not an architectonic aspect.
Change in the definition of the API od some core-module of a system, that is used by a lot of other modules and systems is very likely to be an architectonic theme.


Software structure on the other hand is practically a system design, and can be very high-level (like block-diagram that shows the main modules or tiers) till very detailed (blueprint of code).

This high-level view of the software structure would definitelly be part of the software architecture, while detailed design not (maybe some important parts).

UPDATE (after the comments)


  1#Any hints about which diagram is highly recommended for Software
  architecture and software structure?because it sounds that class
  diagram should be used in both cases (architecture and structure)


It's not about which UML diagram to make, but rather what is important to show, which aspect.

All diagrams could be therefore used to depict an architectonic aspect. 
Most common however and probably mandatory diagram is component diagram. It naturally shows the high-level design in terms of system modules and the way they interface each other. It can be optionally extended by a deployment view.
Class diagram is used to show the internal structure of the components, by representing more or less detailed class structure and relationships. Not all class diagrams are architectonic relevants, but some can definitelly be so (""ask yourself..."" :))

There are lots of other potentialy important aspects, like system behavior. Hier you can use UML sequences, state machines, activities and so on. Some of those build up the architecture, others are less significant, but also usefull to show.


  2#As I understand from the answer that the detailed design is not part
  of architecture/structure design but I can use for it the same type of
  UML diagrams such as class and sequence diagram (that is used in
  architecture and structure )with more detailed information. right?


As told, it's not about the type of diagram itself, but about the displayed content. So, if you consider that content is relevant, youput it under architecture. If not, it is considered as a detailed design. 

Example: a sequence can be shown to show a critical real-time communication with an external device. Although it can be very low-level, it can be fundamental for the fullfillment of an important requirement.
The same type of diagram can be used to show a local algorithm or a use case scenario which is not so important, therefore not part of the architecture. 


  3#Does the high level design is the same as Architectural design

Software to handle snmp,"I want to find a software that handles snmp for me. In my grails software I want to handle snmp traps, poll snmp from devices, and send snmp traps. The software should have some interfaces to collect the data. We are using ActiveMq,this would also be an option to get the data. I found opennms, but it looks the software does much more than I need, which is not necessary. I already looked at snmp4j. With this library I can program my own software for this, but I wonder if there is already a program which will fit my purposes. Any ideas? Best regards, 
PeterIf you have any plans to implement your own Trap Receiver I'd suggest using NET-SNMP, SNMP++ or SNMP4J frameworks. Please also note that these frameworks do not support parsing of SMIv1, SMIv2 MIB files. So you'll have to implement your own MIB parser or use an exisiting one to do that. There are few open source MIB parsers but they are poorly implemented. So the parsing accuracy is real bad. I'd suggest using commercial SNMP products for enterprise-grade projects.

There are many SNMP products on the market. The industry standard product for SNMP traps handling is NetDecision TrapVision. Find out more at: http://www.netmechanica.com/products/?prod_id=1003 . It does many things:


Fully supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2C, SNMPv3 (USM and VACM)
Ultra high performance (thousands traps per minute)
Resolves incoming SNMP traps based on MIB definitions (You can load any MIB files both standard and enterprise specific)
You can filter out SNMP traps
You can write incoming traps to DB or log file
You can configure rules (trap handlers) to execute custom actions on the reception of a SNMP trap like email, sms, etc
You can assign severity to a trap based on rules
You can acknowledge and clear SNMP traps via GUI.
You can assign troubleshooting information to a particular trap
SNMP traps are displayed in modern GUI. You can manage SNMP notifications as easy as emails in MS Outlook.

Software to inflect English [closed],"I don't know of any.

However, you might want to have a look at nltk.org (Natural Language Toolkit) which is a Python library for natural language processing that has many features that could potentially be very helpful, such as POS (part of speech) tagging.

This is, of course, if you would be fine with writing such a software yourself, sorry if it is not relevant to what you want to do.I don't know of any either, but I'll try to give some suggestions.


Snowball can normalize many of the words using the porter stemming system, but the endings are often incorrect. What might be possible though is to use the wordlists from e.g. the Moby CROSSWD.TXT, use snowball to find common roots and guess the tense from the ending (e.g. ends with ed or d might be past tense etc.) PyStemmer has wrappers for python if that's what you use, but I couldn't find any Windows binaries so for my purposes I had to build it myself. Bear in mind that this method is error-prone, and that it normalizes e.g. tries and try normalize to tri, and there are many exceptions where this doesn't work. Some implementations (there's one in the nltk I believe as mentioned by houbysoft) have many exceptions pre-programmed in, but the problem is that English is such an irregular language that it fixes the inflection of some words but breaks others.
Another way is to parse the WordNet data which I believe has ""classes"" of words by inflections, and exceptions where words don't fit with the rules. It's a pretty heavy task though, I've tried to parse it using the various man pages and haven't succeeded as yet myself (see http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/morphy.7WN.html for information on parsing inflections.)
You could try parsing spelling data from OpenOffice or something similar as they usually group words together into ""classes"", this is especially attractive for regional (e.g. Australian/British English etc) although it doesn't tell you which inflection etc each word is in.


Anyway, I hope this helps, I think the nltk library is a good place to start as it has a porter (and various other stemming implementations) and lots of example code.

Software update failed.,"So after spending hours fixing a PHP issue I broke it again. So i noticed in the admin console there was an optional update to apply. I went through the usual process and it failed halfway through. Now i am at the point where it says a particular file is broken and to either download the file from the my client area or the whole install from the same place and upload to the server. Well i did that but its still not working. I tried going to the admin upgrade as the site suggested and its still showing I have an issue with one of the files.



	 



	  Any ideas how i can get round this?UnavailableHave a look at this topic:




	🙂^ this is indeed the solution to your problem at present. We are aware of this and will be resolved at some point tomorrow.So I am now getting this error instead. honestly its one problem after another



	 



	We were unable to start a PHP session. You will need to contact your host to adjust your PHP configuration before you can continue. The error reported was: session_start(): Failed to read session data: files (path: /var/cpanel/php/sessions/ea-php81)Please visit just /admin/upgrade and remove anything after that. If you are then still having the same issue, you would need to contact your hosting company on that one, as that would be a hosting issue unfortunately.

	You would need to ask your hosting provider on this but typically it is public_html. The important folders in our software would be:



		/applications/ - if you have third party add-ons.
	
	
		/plugins/ - if you have third party add-ons.
	
	
		/uploads/ - this stores all attachments your users upload.

		conf_global.php
	
	
		of course, your database.

Software updates and UAC,"How does Windows handle security and software updates? I need to deploy software to several computers, which will be regularly updated. The update just downloads and runs the new installer. Obviously for the initial installation an administrator needs to run the installer, but after that is the installer white-listed to be run as a non-administrator? This is for XP and 7. The installer is an msi generated with WiX.No, the installer is not white listed. Even if it were, the update is another installer. So the answer to your question: users will have to confirm elevation in UAC prompt.

Firefox and Opera are the examples. Every time an update is ready to be installed, the updater shows UAC prompt. Chrome on the other hand updates without UAC prompt, simply because it installs into user's profile which is not write-protected (I mean current user has full rights).

Firefox plans to implement a service to facilitate the update process. The service runs under system privileges, it can start the updater with system privileges without user consent for elevation, because it already has full access to the system. This is how antivirus software updates itself. Usually there are two processes: the service and the client which displays UI and communicates to the service.

In the case of MSI, there are system policies. For example, you can enable a policy according to which any Windows Installer-based installation will be run elevated. Usually patches (minor updates) are run elevated. There may exist a policy which controls major updates (where the old version is uninstalled and then a new one is installed), yet I am not aware of such.",,,,,1,274,68.46,11.79,82.91,30.13,14.42,28.1,78.47,59.12,53.28,6.93,1.82,1.09,0,0.73,0,0,5.11,15.33,10.58,1.09,10.58,10.95,6.57,5.47,1.46,12.77,4.38,2.55,2.55,0,0.36,2.19,14.6,0.73,13.87,2.19,2.55,1.82,2.55,0.73,5.47,0,0.73,0.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.55,1.46,0,0,0,0,1.09,1.09,0,0,0,0,1.82,0,0,1.82,3.65,0.36,0.73,2.55,0,0,0.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.46,0,0,0,0.73,0,0,0.36,0,1.46,8.39,0.36,2.19,5.11,0.73,0,0,9.12,0.73,8.39,3.28,0.36,0.36,0,0,0,16.06,6.57,4.01,0.73,0,0.36,4.38,
Software usability vs efficiency,"Does ensuring software usability always result in a decrease in efficiency?It normally results in an increase in efficiency for the user - if you have a user interacting with the software, this is normally the rate limiting step in anything it achieves anyway, so taking everything into account I'd say a resounding ""no"".Efficiency for whom?

Usability should increase the user's efficiency - which, in nearly all cases, should be the most important measurement.

Though one measure of usability is the speed of response of the software which is one sort of efficiency, so - turning your statement around - by making the software more efficient you are making it more usable.The answer is ultimately no. 

Usability: 


How easily can a user accomplish their goals?
How obvious is the correct path to their target?
How difficult it is for a user to fail?


Ideally, you would be able to answer very to all of these.

Efficiency:


Programmer Efficiency: How many things need to be implemented vs. are being implemented
Processor Efficiency: How fast does the application run
Memory Efficiency: How small is the application's running footprint
User Efficiency: How fast can the user accomplish their task


Applications which are not usable tend to have:


Too many options
Too much screen clutter
Few helpful indicators
Few icons
Little guidance


In order to be a strongly usable program, it means that the user must be able to quickly and easily accomplish their tasks without anything else getting in their way. 

Simplification

In general, this would mean removing all options that a user does not need. Even if there is an option that a user could need, it should only be presented to them when it is a relevant option at that moment. 

Doing this increases all four of the efficiency goals we set out earlier. Fewer options to implement, fewer items to render, and faster user efficiency. Simplification both enhances usability and increases efficiency. However, this is at the cost of a higher upfront design-time. 

Icons and indicators

Adding icons and indicators will typically (if done correctly) enhance usability, however they do decrease programmer efficiency, as they are extra tasks which need to be completed. Presuming a web-app, they would increase (to whatever extent, large or small) the render time of the page if you are sending more large images, rather than a strictly text page. 

However, they dramatically increase the user efficiency and usability. 

Basically, increases in usability require a large investment up front to design your application correctly, and to run a large number of usability tests. These can inturrupt your development cycle but they will create a better project. They will also reduce bugs and require less of a support infrastructure, because your application will be better suited to its purpose.

Usability is always worth investing in.Absolutely not. Usability is efficiency.

The word 'sufficient' come to mind.

In any case the question is kinda a non-event. If the product has now usability then it aint going to be used ... so it then has low value.  :-)

Software: How does software recognize a song?,"I was playing with my phone and there is this app on it that when u use it to record 10 seconds of a song, it tells you the title and author of that song. Now as a software engineer I can't help but wonder, How does this work?Well, actually Shazam has written a paper explaining the inner workings of the algorithm, you can find it at this address (pdf).

Basically they have a huge database of all the songs that the algorithm can recognize and they create a kind of ""hashtag"" of the music using its spectrogram. Then, when you record a part of the song and send it to them, they pass it through the same algorithm and try to match it with the hashtags that are stored in the database.

Of course it's a lot more complicated than that since they have to manage the recording noise and stuff like that, but it's the basic idea.Find the answer here:

Spaghetti code visualisation software?,"a smoking pile of spaghetti just landed on my desk, and my task is to understand it (so I can refactor / reimplement it). The code is C, and a mess of global variables, structure types and function calls. I would like to plot graphs of the code with the information:

- Call graph

- Which struct types are used in which functions
 
- Which global variable is used in what function Hopefully this would make it easier to identify connected components, and extract them to separate modules. I have tried the following software for similar purposes:

- ncc

- ctags

- codeviz / gengraph

- doxygen

- egypt

- cflow

EDIT2:

- frama-c

- snavigator

- Understand The shortcomings of these are either

a) requires me to be able to compile the code. My code does not compile, since portions of the source code is missing.

b) issues with preprocessor macros (like cflow, who wants to execute both branches of #if statements). Running it through cpp would mess up the line numbers.

c) I for some reason do not manage to get the software to do what I want to do (like doxygen; the documentation for call graph generation is not easy to find, and since it does not seem to plot variables/data types anyway, it is probably not worth spending more time learning about doxygen's config options). EDIT: I did follow a these Doxygen instrcutions, but it did only plot header file dependencies I am on Linux, so it is a huge plus if the software is for linux, and free software. Not sure my boss understands the need to buy a visualizer :-( For example: a command line tool that lists in which functions a symbol (=function,variable,type) is referenced in would be of great help (like addr2line, but for types/variable names/functions and source code). //TMy vote goes to gnu global. It has all the features of ctags/cscope combined as well as the possibility to generate fully indexed html which allows you to browse the code in your favorite browser. Fire it up in apache and you have a web-service that anyone can access including full search capabilities.

It integrates nicely into emacs/vim/even the bash-shell, and you can use it directly from the shell-prompt.

To see it in action on the linux kernel, visit this

Combine that with a tool for cyclomatic complexity plugin for eclipse which calculates the complexity of your code. besides the cyclomatic complexity it can handle:


McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity
Efferent Couplings
Lack of Cohesion in Methods
Lines Of Code in Method
Number Of Fields
Number Of Levels
Number Of Locals In Scope
Number Of Parameters
Number Of Statements
Weighted Methods Per Class


...and you should have everything you need.If you like command line ;) maybe you could try cscope, it does static analysis of code and can tell you where are referenced some symbols/variables/functions... Not the Holy Graal, but it can be pretty usefull to browse unknown source code. 

There are also some GUI that can handle csope results (Vi, Emacs, JEdit...).

On the other hand, Eclipse with the CDT plugin can also help you to navigate into the spaghetti code you have to maintain.It's not free and afaik not linux but cppDepend might be worth evaluating - at least until someone comes up with a more suitable suggestion :)

Subscription based software: Does it work? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 9 years ago. A while back I worked with a software company that sold a specialized software product.  Ever so often they would release a patch for free and a new version that would require an upgrade fee.  This is typically how the software industry works. After some time the company decided on a new strategy, Subscription based software.  This turns out to be a way for the software company to charge a small, incremental fee for each ""transaction"" that is performed on their software.  Under this model the patches and upgrades were included in the per/transaction fee and there was a 'true up' in the number of transactions every so often in order to collect their fees. To me this seems like a better way to develop and sell software.  The software company gets continual income stream, the customer doesn't have to worry about upgrade costs and such,  and if the customer gets really big then your income stream grows with their growth. The problem (and reason for this question) is that I don't see anyone doing that anymore.  Is it because this model doesn't work?  Have I taken an overly simplistic view of developing and selling software without seeing some of the negative sides of this model? [EDIT] I am interested in the developers opinion on whether writing Subscription based software is a good way to develop software. So this question is directed towards the professional developers who have worked on commercial applications:  Can anyone speak with experience on this model and why it does/doesn't work?I used to work for a company which moved from product license to subscription based model. Here are some observations about that: 


Offer both product license and subscription models
In product license: user buys 'n' number of seats for their use. 
In subscription models, customer buys your software for 'x' months time and 'y' people. 
It will help you a lot if your company also develops 'consultants' who will work with your customers to get the software implementation etc at client site (any required installation, training etc)


In fact if you see services like GMail enterprise, Fogbuz etc they give different pricing options:


where you want the app hosted: your servers or their servers
you will be charged $x per number of people using the software


I think a subscription model (time based) will definitely work in the current times and in fact the cloud model helps towards such freedom in revenue models: for example, you can choose to 'subscribe' to a cloud database rather than purchasing a database server.Yes it does.  See salesforce.com for an example.Red Hat seems to think it works. Buy a year of support get all the upgrades/etc/etc. Except they let you keep the product when the year is up (so.. I guess customers like that too =).It's not exactly the same but basecamp from 37Signals is very succesful with a monthly fee basis, and FogBugz also uses the same model. The approach you're talking about here seems similar to the MircoPayment idea that was seen as a revenue earner in the early days on the web. I'm not sure if anyone succesfully made money from that model, I'm sure a lot of VC was spent trying.

[Edit] I think this an exellent way for small ISVs to run their businesses. The combination of SAAS and subscription is a great way of getting revenue quickly. There are a number of advantages

1) Continuous revenue

2) Small or zero initial payment, brings customers in, beats that credit card price point issue (it's easier to charge $10/month than $100 one off)

3) Builds a solid relationship between ISV and vendor

4) Chance to upsell, assuming the offering is good

And the only way you're going to be a big software vendor is by being a small one first.Due to the nature of software development a subscription based model is really the way to go, but how do make sure that you have continues updates that actually make software worth subscription fees.
If you're providing a service it's a lot easier to motivate subscription frees but if you're planning on having people pay monthly for monthly releases, well than that's a thin line between success and utter failure. I don't see how this would work with most software.
Update: @Dscoduc
I would call that a service then. Make a clear distinction between software release schedule and support. If you want to charge for a premium support deal well that service gonna have to be pristine. But I do see how it could work. People might end up buying subscription based software on the premises that they will be able to tailor it to fit their needs without programming experience and at a low cost.
Your challenge lies in being able to listen to your customers and really find a way of taking their feedback and making that the foundation for your software life-cycle and that's not going to be an easy thing to do.

Subscriptions - Possible to Exclude Member Group from Promotion/Demotion on Purchase/Renewal?,"Is there a way to exclude certain member groups from group promotions when using a subscription?  



	I had a subscriber that I later made a moderator.  He wants to continue contributing to the site financially, but each time his subscription renews, it switches him back into the group setup for subscribers.  



	Is there a way to set moderators from being promoted when they have an active subscription?  I figured if worse comes to worse, I can create a new subscription that does not have promotion enabled, but I'd prefer to not create multiple ones if I can avoid it.  



	Thanks!If I recall right, only accounts with ACP access are automatically excluded from promotion/demotion. There's no additional setting to exclude other specific groups.



	In theory you could add them to a group with ACP access but totally restrict their account so they can't actually do anything (except changing their email address or password).That might work to add them to the ACP with no permissions.",,,,,1,166,40.05,12.33,62.53,13.74,20.75,22.89,87.35,66.27,54.82,13.86,10.24,4.22,0,0.6,1.81,3.61,3.61,12.65,6.63,0,12.05,9.64,6.02,6.02,3.01,16.27,6.63,2.41,7.23,0.6,4.22,2.41,21.08,1.2,19.88,2.41,3.01,4.22,3.61,1.2,9.04,0.6,3.01,1.2,1.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.06,5.42,1.2,0.6,0,0,1.2,9.64,0,0,0,1.81,0.6,0,0,0.6,5.42,0,0,4.82,1.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,1.81,0,0,1.2,0.6,1.2,4.22,6.02,0,0.6,6.02,0,0,0,3.61,1.81,7.23,1.2,0,0,0,0,0,12.65,4.22,3.01,1.2,0.6,1.81,1.81,
Subversion as software deployment [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 9 years ago. I would like to deploy the a compiled software globally. Since I already had a subversion server for code versioning control, I intend to use SVN for software deployment. However since many people uses apt-get for software deployment, I would like to see the pros and cons of using SVN over apt-get.Don't check in compiled code into Subversion! This is especially true with packages (RPM or .deb).

What I've seen is people store their packages in Subversion, then use either a Web-SVN browser to specify the URL, or do a checkout and put the package on their local system. I do not recommend this.

The reason is simple: Compiled binary takes up a lot of room. Our RPM packages could be hundreds of megabytes in size. Every time you commit one into Subversion, you increase the size of your repository by a few hundred megabytes. After a few releases, you have gigabytes worth of binaries in your repository.

And for what? You can't diff binaries in Subversion. You can't look at their history and see anything useful. And, binaries have a short shelf life. This is especially true where it's common to do releases multiple times per month. You end up with a bloated repository that must be maintained, and 90% of it is information that no one cares about.

Yet, people do this because it's convenient. You give someone the Subversion URL, and they can download it. Big deal. If you had a dedicated release server, they can do the same thing, and it will be faster. And, you can delete the older releases that no one needs anymore and save gigabytes worth of space.

Just because a lot of people do something doesn't mean you should too. A lot of people do heroin too, and I don't recommend that either.

Do you have a build server like Jenkins? If you do, store your compiled packages there. You can delete the older packages (Jenkins will do that for you), and keep a connection between the source code and the package.

At one place where I worked, we setup Jenkins with the Promoted Build Plugin. When we did a release, we would go into the Jenkins build, and promote it. The promotion would tag our source code, lock the build to prevent Jenkins from deleting the archived package, and send the package over to our apt-get server. Even better, we would mark the build with the release number. You could go into Jenkins, find the build that was released, review the source code, download the package, and see all the changes between one build and the next.

Our Subversion repository contained only source, and users could use an actual apt-get package server for automatic package updates.SVN contains the source, whereas apt-get will take care of all the installation for the product. Usually when using SVN you'd only be able to get a copy of the software and would need to install it yourself, manually.

Hope this helps.",,,,,1,524,52.76,76.6,10.04,62.28,14.16,20.99,81.3,68.51,56.68,13.36,7.82,1.53,1.53,3.82,0,0.95,5.53,17.18,8.97,1.34,11.83,10.5,4.01,7.06,1.53,16.98,5.15,6.3,3.24,1.72,1.34,0.19,14.89,1.34,13.55,1.53,3.63,4.96,2.29,0.38,2.29,0,2.67,2.67,0,0.95,0.95,0,0,0,0,0,9.54,2.67,0.76,0,0,0.19,0.57,6.49,0,0,0,0,1.72,0,0,1.72,3.44,0,0.19,2.48,0.76,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0.38,0.38,0.95,0,0,0,0.19,0.19,0,5.53,7.25,0.38,0.76,5.53,0.95,0,0,4.39,2.29,4.39,0.95,0,0,0,0,0,17.18,6.87,5.53,0.57,0.19,1.72,2.29,
Suite Renewal and Apple Pay,",.



	i went to go renew my license this morning, and being super early and not having my coffee yet, i didn't want to pull out my debit card and type out the really complicated strings of numbers 😛 (as the card on file is super outdated lol) and i'm done paying paypal fees this month, so i was excited to see ""apple pay"". So i selected it, thought it was odd it was showing 'GPay', was like ""alright, that will work too, i have that"". however when i clicked on it, nothing happened. so i thought maybe it was me using chrome, so i tried safari, same thing. it showed the 'GPay"" logo, but when i clicked on it, nothing happened. So i ended up having to get my debit card. this is no biggy, just thought i'd let you know, maybe apple pay is too big brained for me, but i couldn't get it to work for renewal.Thank you for letting us know.

System error when accessing Calendar after upgrading from IPS 4.7.0 to 4.7.1,"Yesterday, I upgraded my IPS site from 4.7.0 to 4.7.1. Suddenly, I got numerous System error records into System log that indicates the issue within Calendar app. When I tried accessing Calendar, it shows the following error message:


Error: Call to undefined method DateTime::getDateInformation() (0)


	My IPS site is running on PHP 8.1.9. There is no issue like this on IPS 4.7.0 with the same PHP version. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that this issue is not related to PHP. Also, I tried clearing system cache and disable / re-enable the Calendar app but still unable to resolve this issue.



	Any help or suggestion would be appreciated. Thank you in advance for your support.Thanks for reporting this. I have moved this to a ticket so we can better investigate this for you. Please watch your email for further correspondence.Identical issue, same behaviour. Also running PHP 8, IPS 4.7.1 with all patches (was not happening with 4.7.0). Started this morning.



	Note: I can see individual calendars and add entries but not view the main/summary calendar page (/calendar) – that throws up exactly the same errors as described by @Foolboy.

	Edited August 11 by PoC2Further investigation:



	This error only occurs on the /calendar page when it is drawing in multiple calendars to display. If just one calendar is active (viewable) then no error.



			
				


	Edited August 11 by PoC2Thank you. Based on the investigation from @PoC2 , I also found that only calendar with user-defined events will cause this issue. Blank calendars with only member's birthday will not throw this error. Even trying to add new event into the calendar will also cause this error. This is definitely a bug.In my case I can view and add to any single calendar (including ones with user defined events) but again, not the summary view (/claendar) for displaying multiple calendars at once on a page.Is this related to the recent patch?SameOn 8/12/2022 at 4:43 AM,   Giray said:

	I have created a ticket to investigate this further on your system.Please do keep us informed when there's a fix available. 🙂



	Thank you.This seems to be an issue with the recent cPanel version, any chance you're also using it @PoC2?We've been looking further into this today, it appears that a bug ""fix"" in PHP 8.0.22 & 8.1.9 has caused some issues - https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=80047 



	I suspect this unannounced breaking change may cause issues in other software packages. The bug report suggests this change was actually intended for PHP 8.2 but was committed to 8.0/8.1 anyway.



	We're working on a solution. I do not know at this time whether PHP might roll it back in the next release or not so we'll do something to work with either situation.On 8/12/2022 at 8:58 AM,   Daniel F said:

	I'm on 8.0 rather than 8.2 so it looks like they've actually done that to the earlier version as well as you suggest.

	Thank you. Invision support has always been superb and that means a lot.



	Meanwhile I can tick along with just showing one calendar. Not a dealbreaker for me once I figured that out. 😉

Template / CSS,"Since im using the BETA, im not seeing all templates / css files in theme editor (for example)



	


	 



	Has something changed or is my theme not compatible ?



	 



	Im Using Dynamic Theme 1.1.9Any Idea?In the top right you should see an ""Advanced theme editing"" button. This will bring up all templates if neededSame problem here, following upgrade to 4.7.0.



	With ""Advanced theme editing"" enabled, I can only see core-front-custom-custom.css. None of the other css files are showing. I have also run the support tool and cleared the cache and the issue remains



	I made a note of css files I need to revert, after updating but now I'm hamstrung and can't do the reverts.As of 4.7.0, only true custom CSS files will show to discourage editing framework CSS. 

	 



	Have you edited framework CSS files in the past?Not recently, but I have now no way of comparing the two versions to see what's going on and no way of reverting if something is amiss. That's a bit of a setback and more of a 'downdate' than an update.



	I have always used the access to the standard CSS files to determine what code to modify (along with the syntax etc), before adding it to my custom CSS. I can't do that now, which is going to make any future additions to the custom CSS far more difficult for me to accomplish.On 7/6/2022 at 10:33 AM,   JohnDar said:

	I'm working on an upgrade step to resolve this. 👍I've released a patch so that custom CSS in other areas, and also CSS that has been edited is now visible when editing a theme.Thank you.



	Going forward, maybe the best solution would be to have all CSS showing but read-only, with the ability to revert if differences are found?I have applied the patch and can now see the (allegedly) customised CSS. However, there is still no way to compare it with the standard version to see what might have changed. There is also no way to revert it.



	I could go in and hack about in Designer mode, but if everyone is faced with doing that, this change might be counter productive in terms of support volumes?



	I think my suggestion in the reply above might be the best solution for both yourselves and customers?On 7/7/2022 at 11:14 AM,   JohnDar said:

	Click the cog icon in the top right of the template/CSS editor and then click 'compare with default'. You should see a diff showing the changes between the default version and your customised version. You should also have a revert button in the top right if it's a modified core CSS file. Note: neither of these will be available if it's a custom CSS file you have created.That's great, thanks. Is there a full record of the default CSSs available somewhere for reference purposes?On 7/7/2022 at 1:20 PM,   JohnDar said:

	Still not seeing all of them. By any chance, was this restricted only to anything under ""front"", or was this patch also applied to ""global""?I have just applied the latest update. It flagged two CSS files that were incompatible. Both were reverted before updating. However, once the update was applied, photo attachment thumbnails were missing. This indicated that there were other CSS files which needed attention and a check with the default theme confirmed this,(I couldn't see anything amiss in the templates).



	However, there was no way of determining where the issues might be. The only CSS file available for me to edit was custom.css. No others were showing up as modified. I had absolutely no way of checking for other modified CSS, with a view to reverting them.



	My only way out of this was to copy the default theme and then laboriously go through every tab, modifying the colours to match my customised theme. I then had to edit the resources and add in all my custom mods. I then had to add in the custom CSS from the broken theme.



	This worked and I'm back up and running, but it's two hours of my life that I won't get back. Previously this type of fix would have taken me about two minutes.



	Needless to say, I'm deeply unhappy with the removal of the edit feature and concerned about how some edits don't seem to have been picked up, leaving me with no way out other than a ground-up rebuild.

"The ""Installed Software"" vs ""Features"" vs ""Plug-ins"" in eclipse","When I click the Installation Details in eclipse, I got this tab for Installed software and a tab for Features and a tab for plug-ins. What are the relationships between eclipse software, eclipse features, and eclipse plugin as is shown in this window? I guess Help -> Install New Software ... to install software, and software is comprised of a bunch of related plugins. Those two tabs are just the same contents (software names/plugin names) that is installed from Install New Software ... menu? In his answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/12863077/260127, Bananeweizen says Eclipse ""features"" are the smallest installable pieces of Eclipse applications for users (e.g. the Java development toolkit). They consist of multiple plugins, where plugins are the smallest pieces that make sense from the developers point of view (e.g. org.eclipse.jdt.core, org.eclipse.jdt.ui, org.eclipse.jdt.somethingelse)., but to me it seems like eclipse feature is almost the same as eclipse software, and eclipse application is a set of eclipse software(feature) on top of eclipse platform.""Installed software"" is that subset of features, which you as a user actively choose to install in this Eclipse instance.

The features list on the other hand contains all features installed in this Eclipse instance. It includes all items from ""installed software"" and it contains the dependencies of the items from ""installed software"". Those are the features which you did not choose to install by yourself, but the Eclipse P2 update manager decided that, to be able to satisfy your installation request.

So again, an Eclipse installation process installs features, some of them on request of the user, some of them on request of the system to be able to install those from the user.

To make this all more complicated, Eclipse features are often referred to as ""plugins"" by Eclipse users, although that is not correct. So if you read about something like ""installing the PHP plugin"", that really refers to installing the PHP feature, which again consists of multiple plugins (but you don't see those as an Eclipse user, only as an Eclipse developer).

You can double click one of the features in that dialog to see the list of plugins it contains.A  plugin is  that adds specific abilities to a larger software application.

Each plug-in
 1)Contributes to 1 or more extension points(Means it can increase his property by just connecting it to any extension point)
 2.)Small set of prog which generally require JRE and add some small feature to your Eclipse SDK..

While eclipse software is a set of plugins(Generally called RCP-Rich Client Platform )which provide a complete functionality to eclipse SDK.Yep, software may consists of multiple plugins.

The concept of software reuse,"I don't quite get the concept of software reuse ... Wikipedia provided ""code reuse"" & ""re-usability"" nothing specific about SOFTWARE reuse ... Please, if you could explain the concept clearly, I'd be grateful.The name is self-explanatory. There is some software that you want to reuse. It is quite simple to understand.  

I will use Java to explain reusability so please bear with me.  

class Parent{
    int[] numbers;
    public void supplyNumbers(int[] someNumbers){
        this.numbers = someNumbers;
    }

    public void performSorting(){
        for(int i=0;i<numbers.length;i++){
            //perform sorting here
        }
    }
}  


So there is a class Parent that has an array of numbers and two methods to supply the numbers and perform some sorting operation on it.

Now, I want to create another class that needs similar such functions. Instead of re-writing the code, all I would do is I would inherit the code as follows:  

class Child extends Parent{

}  


So where is the code ? Well, I do not need to write anything as it will be automatically provided to me as I have inherited it from the Parent class.

I am reusing what I wrote previously. This is code reusability.  

Also, when you make imports in Java, you are reusing the code the devs wrote. :)I don't quite get the concept of software reuse ... Wikipedia provided ""code reuse"" & ""re-usability"" nothing specific about SOFTWARE reuse ...

Theme update help,"Hi Team,

	I have been staring at this update and have been nervous to try and push it through.

	Sometimes software updates break more than they fix/help.




	Today I clicked it and figured maybe I should give it a go...



	When I click it I am met with the following message.



	I then click GET SUPPORT.

	And see the following.




	 



	Logs states:




	If I click disable Third Party APPS. I see the following



	 



	I am not sure where to go and what to do...

	Is there a fee I can pay to have this fixed by tech support for me?

	Happy to pay for professional help.Likely that the theme is compatible with IPS 4.7 only, you are on 4.6.12.1@MeanGene



	I see you use Ehren's theme. The latest version of the themes is compatible with 4.7.1 and you must have IPS 4.7.1 to use the theme.



	In general, in case of Ehren's themes always a theme and IPS software should share the same version unless it is clearly stated by the author that no updates are required.



			
				


	Edited August 21 by LuuukAgreed, update your IPS version and you should be good to go. No need to pay anyone, easy peezy. I have Ehren's themes too, and as stated his version themes typically mimic the theme version number of IPS, unless he specifically states no upgrade needed. In this case you do need to upgrade your community to work with the current theme you have. 🙂 



			
				


	Edited August 21 by JohnCourtOk. Thanks everyone.



	 



	So. First, update IPS to 4.7.1



	Second. Updated Theme to 4.7.1



	Will give it a go and report back. Thank you!Update.


	I went to run the 4.7.1 IPS update and got this.




	 



	Prior to running the update it flagged certain text changes that were custom changes to the template theme.

	I changed the Heading tabs from the ""stock"" words to my custom tabs.

	Not sure how that can fudge it up?


	But something isn't happy.


	Any ideas?Quick update.



	 



	On a whim I tried to run the update again... and it worked!

	Weird quirk in the system? 

	I'll take  it.

Theories of software engineering [closed],"Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post. Closed 5 years ago. In my career I've come across two broad types of theory: physical theories and educational/management theories: Physical theories are either correct (under appropriate conditions) or incorrect, as judged by the physical world. Educational/management theories have the appearance of being like physical theories, but they lack rigorous testing. At best they give new ways of thinking about problems. Multiple theories are useful because one of them may speak to you in the right way. As an hobbyist student of software engineering there appear to be a lot of theories of software engineering (such agile programming, test driven design, patterns, extreme programming). Should I consider these theories to be physical-like or educational/management-like? Or have I mis-understood software engineering and find myself being in the position of ""not even wrong""?Software engineering is ultimately about psychology, how humans manage complexity.  So software engineering principles are far more like education and management theories than physical principles.

Some software engineering has solid math behind it: O(n log n) sorts are faster than O(n^2) sorts, etc.  But mostly software engineering is about how humans think about software.  How to organize things so that maintainers don't go crazy, anticipating what is likely to change and what is not, preventing and detecting human errors, etc.  It's a branch of psychology or sociology.I think the appropriate theoretical split is those ""harder"" sciences (where there can be proofs)  and the softer topics with qualitative answers and few proofs if any.

Software to me is mostly about language and communication, a topic that is qualitative and subjective mostly. Every now and then we touch into algorithms and other ""hard"" areas, where proofs and rigorous formalisms exist. So, yes, both please.Not even wrong.

All the software engineering ""theories"" seem to be nothing but advice on particular things to try to see if they make you and your team more productive.  Even if one could set them up to be falsifiable like scientific theories, there would be very little point to it.  That is not to say that it is not worthwhile to learn about them -- au contraire, you should become familiar with as many of them as possible and try to figure out in what kinds of teams and environment they may work better.  But be careful: avoid dogma and thinking there are silver bullets.i wouldn't call agile programming, test driven design, patterns, extreme programming, etc 'theories', they're methodologies, or work styles.  they don't make any assertions.Generally the field of Informatics is divided into 4 areas (need to find a link to the source, SWEBOK?), which are distinct although related and interconnected:


Computer Science
Software Engineering
Computer Engineering
Information Systems


There is a good analysis of engineering vs. science in Steve McConnel's ""Professional Software Development"". Check out his Software Engineering, Not Computer Science.

Software development is more about engineering - finding practical solutions to practical problems - than anything else. That is correct that software engineering relies on computer science, mathematics, complexity theory, systematics, psychology, and other disciplines, but it can not be equated to any of them, nor is it a batch of any of them.Besides theories, there are also frameworks, models and rules of thumb. Ideas, sure, but based on a less rigorous foundation, which loosely belong to your eduction/management category.

Computer Science has some strong foundational theories (physical ones by your definition), but these mostly consist of tying together the smaller elements. 

Software Engineering on the other hand, is a relatively new discipline that involves utilizing computers and occasionally Computer Science to build software systems. Most of the practice in that arena is entirely based on non-rigorous experimental and anecdotal evidence. Since the jury is still out on even the simplest of issues, most of what passes for practices could be best described as pure guess-work and irrational preference. It's one of those disciplines where you really do have to know a lot to realize how much is built on a house of very unstable cards. 

Paul.Being intangible, programming is a very difficult activity to relate to another human being, even other programmers.  Software engineering tries to add structure where there is none, but such structure is not rooted in the inevitability of reality.  So all these approaches become like religions in how groups of people behave when trying to appease their technical gods (or demons).All these theories and best practices still haven't brought us to the point where we can produce software systems reliably and predictably.  The newest of these surveys is dated 2001; Jeff's column from 2006 still laments high failure rates.

It'd be interesting to see if anybody's working on an updated survey.  

Avionics and the software running my car don't seem to fail at anything close to the rates quoted for enterprise software.  Why don't enterprise developers follow their practices more closely?  Maybe we should all be writing Ada....[just kidding]They're like recipes: they're guidelines, whose success depends:


Partly, on the quality of the recipe
Partly, on the quality of the ingredients
Partly, on the skill of (and time available to) the practitionersFor me, it's my own theory with many of the others used as a base. I don't know any one that uses a single specific theory. And that's not a cop out answer.

Just as there are different languages, theories/practices/methodologies are to be used in distinct situations. The structure, rules, and definitions are all the ways in which people understand how things are to be accomplished, but what is to be accomplished is subjective.

Adapt, knowing the agile, extreme, or other methods at the discretion of the client, project, programmer, time, and especially what makes you successful/happy. Be a team and adjust/adapt to what your team is doing for the greater good; just keep in mind to have something that you have defined in your own mind, or it's not just chaos.

[SOAPBOX] 
I started programming on the Atari 400 with a converted flat keyboard and 64K upgrade. When I started college, it was VB 1.0 which I saw my Economics Teacher use to build a teaching tool to help people learn more about economics using graphs and visual inputs. That was cool! And I knew I could do that. 

This same Economics Teacher, who later become an IT teacher too (he was good), asked if I would teach a class on debugging. He said, ""I haven't met someone that understands the concepts and has a natural ability to debug as fast as you do, would you teach us what you know and how you do it."" This was a boost in my ego, of course, but to teach, mentor, and help others.

Every one of those instances has fuled my desire to help other people. For me, I want a computer to do exactly what I want, to help other people in the business and home life to increase their qualify of living, learn more, and get more done.

Someone said to me one time, ""You're only as good as your tools"". Learn, practice, and grow.

If you've defined something, it's working, has order, and it stretches you and the boundaries, you're not wrong.Is there a think like ""software engineering""?

Or Is software development is ""engineering""?

Facts:


Our industry is very young realtive to many other ""engineerings"".
We still does not have ""solid"" practices and ""theories"".
So to be honest, if we look in the other mature engineering practices perpective, it is hard to call  what we do as ""engineering""
We have a very bad reputation at failing [ our failing rates can not be acceptable at many engineering branches]


Reality or Fantasy? Pick one :-)


Some guys say that we do not have ""solid"" paractices and ""theories"" since we are a young ""engineering"" branch, by time we  will have.Those guys say that wee need to work  more ""theory"" or foundations.
Some guys say that software develepment is ""experimental social activity"" because of the nature of our problem domain. We will have practices theories  methodologies processes but they will always have second order effect. The unique people, their feelings qualities and and their interactions with the rest  are more influential. Those guys see software development as Complex Adaptive System


And there is also another reality

%80 of software development activities really do not need very brilland mind. Any ""average"" person can do it. 

But remaining %20 part is ver hard and multidiciplinary task.

Even there is an another new perspective My One:-)

This view say that software development is not a branch of ""Engineering"". It is brach of ""Natural Sciences and Social Sciences"". So we need Software Anthropology and Anthropologist.Theory: I think a theory is anything that describes ""how"" a natural system works, and in order to prove it, has logical deductions based on previous knowledge, substantiated by logical inductions made using experiments.

You call the whole body of these theories and experiments as Science.

Software: Software is a man-made system aka. an engineered system. Engineering applies Science in order to create the new systems. In that regards, pure Software Engineering applies the science of discrete mathematical systems. 

But Commercial Software Engineering has a different motivation called Economics.
In that regards, it has to take all the factors into account that affect Economics, the chief of them being People. So, Psychology plays a huge part .
But, since Psychology itself is just a theory of ""how"" human mind works based on just pattern recognition without any logical deductions based on human biology, it has many flaws like correlation implies causation.

So, yeah, I think from the above answer, you can better understand what Commercial Software Engineering in total is .",,,,,1,1635,45.52,33.81,48.11,47.09,19.94,26.67,88.2,66.61,52.84,11.38,5.75,1.77,1.04,1.35,0.18,1.28,5.63,12.91,5.08,1.28,12.42,9.36,5.69,7.46,1.65,15.72,8.62,4.59,5.38,1.71,2.51,1.22,20.06,0.73,19.33,6.24,2.69,1.77,3.36,0.67,5.57,0,3,2.32,0.55,0.67,0.43,0.12,0,0,0,0,8.99,3.55,0.61,0.18,0,0.37,1.41,5.5,0,0,0,0.43,4.53,0,0,4.53,8.62,0.12,0.12,7.83,0.55,0.12,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.49,0.24,0.12,0.43,0,0,0.18,0.18,0.98,5.14,5.63,0.18,0.55,3.91,0.55,0,0.49,1.77,1.53,5.93,0.61,0.31,0.18,0.12,0,0,20.18,5.57,5.87,0.49,0.06,1.65,6.54,

Tips on Distributed Monitoring Software?,"we need to monitor computers in different places around the country. They are running software from us in different commercial stores. I am talking about VR-Unity applications and Chrome-Applications. We need to monitor if they are on, running the software, the right fame rate, ideally temperature of the GPU, CPU. Stuff like that. Any tips on software? Thank, you!This seems like a good use-case for SNMPv3. The SNMP agent will be running on the hosts (SNMPd is a linux agent). The agent will report certain metrics to an SNMP Managers. The metrics reported are determined by MiB's and the parameters you mentioned are already in most default MiBs for OSs. The SNMP Manager will be at your NetOps Server and can record/analyze/visualize what you want to see. Nagios (Free) and Solar Winds (Pay) are two common SNMP Manager programs.

Title underneath the Avatar picture?,"Hi,



	What is the official name for the title located underneath the avatar picture in a forum post?



	How can that be changed? And who can change this?



	 



	Thanks!If you're referring to the ""Clients"" in my screenshot below. That would just be the member group name. Unless you allow custom member titles, this would always be the member group name.Thanks for the reply, Jim!

	A while back, we used to allow custom titles after a user hit a certain rank. However, a few major releases back, believe 4.5, we added Achievements which took the place of this and this was then rolled into the ability to have it as a custom profile field. 



	Regardless, the custom title, can be edited in the member's profile.

	Only administrators currently would be able to edit the title currently via the ACP when viewing that user's profile.

Touch Typing Software recommendations [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 10 years ago. Since the keyboard is the interface we use to the computer, I've always thought touch typing should be something I should learn, but I've always been, well, lazy is the word. So, anyone recommend any good touch typing software? It's easy enough to google, but I'ld like to hear recommendations.Typing of the Dead!

It's a good few years old so you may have to hunt around, but it's a lot of fun and as well as the main game there are numerous minigames to practice specific areas you may be weak on.I trained my typing on GNU Typist. It comes with exercises for various languages and keyboard layouts, if you're so inclined.

One of the most fun typing programs I used is dvorak7min. It has a nastiness mode where for each typo you make, the cursor goes back by 1. So if you don't watch your typing, you'll be back to square 1….If you want some motivation to learn to touch type read Steve Yegge's Blog rant:

Programming's Dirtiest Little SecretFind a long document on the web, using Firefox

Press CTRL+F 

Type along with the document. Try it, it works.Mavis Beacon.

Although not nearly as fun as Typing of the Dead!I've been touchtyping since I was 10 years old (on a real typewriter at that!) but one thing that helped my sister learn touchtyping is hanging out in IRC channels. You want to be able to ""talk"" as fast as you can speak and that trained her in typing a lot faster.

I know it's a lame answer and not really a software solution or what, but it worked for a lot of people I know. :)Try http://keybr.com/?  It is a little different from the usual format of free typing tutors.  If you create an account, it keeps track of your progress as well.  No add-ware and no pop-ups, or other useless junk.If you want to learn by getting thrown in the deep end... DasKeyboard ultimate will have you touch typing in no time :)I use Rapid Typing to learn touch typing. It has excellent visuals and it's even somewhat relaxing to type.About the recommendation to use the DasKeyboard, I just started using one today!  But be aware that it makes a lot of noise.  I was mortified how much noise it was making in my super quiet office filled with other people, who are engineers but mostly not developers.  I asked the person across from me if it was too noisy.  She hesitated for a fraction of a second before insisting it was fine, and when I said I would put it away she barely protested.  So I packed it up.  Maybe if you are just surrounded by other devs it would be OK.  I'd love to hear of contrary experiences.  I'm banging away from home right now though, as loud as possible, and loving it!

Oh, and you will definitely learn to touch type!  Right now I have a picture of a labeled keyboard as my desktop image, but am referring to it less and less.

MikeFor the sake of completeness, my wife used KP Typing Tutor, worked great.

+1 on chatting moreI used the TTCoach plugin for Vim and have been very happy with it. It doesnt come with any exercises for numbers and symbols however, but it is easy to just make some text files yourself and write :TTCustom file.txt to use it for exercising. 

Just learn a couple of characters at a time and when you got them nailed, learn a couple more and so on...I've been using TypeFaster. It's not pretty, but one nice feature is that it can load lessons in different keyboard layouts, like Colemak (layout files here) or Dvorak.I have a really weird habitual way of typing where I use several fingers on my left hand but only one or two on the right. This has served me for years and apparently gives me 80+ words per minute, but it does seem an incredibly weird way to type. This is touch typing but not using the ""standard"" finger arrangement. While it's probably not a great idea to try and fix something that already works, I thought I'd try and relearn to type the proper way (left fingers on asdf and right fingers on jkl;).

I've been trying out Mavis Beacon and it seems alright, it slowly adds more and more letters to your repertoire allowing you to gain the muscle memory or whatever, and then focuses on speed. The ""games"" seem a little pointless (is this program designed for kids?), but I guess for someone who doesn't know where the keys are it does a good job showing you which fingers to use and where to move them. As I already knew where the keys are most of the program didn't really aid me. Once you know where the keys are you probably just want to practice typing out text and a program like that won't really aid any more than notepad apart from counting your words per minute and giving you something to type. I agree with Typing of the dead being pretty awesome though, and will definitely help with your speed once you've got the finger arrangement down.

Do all you touch typers use the standard finger arrangement or do you just do your own thing? I think I've come to the conclusion I'll just stick with what I know, it seems to work anyway.",,,,,1,942,35.55,23.24,63.8,51.27,20.04,14.33,90.45,76.01,57.32,14.65,8.6,4.56,0.11,3.18,0.32,0.21,6.05,12.63,6.05,1.7,13.06,8.6,7.01,8.81,1.49,20.06,7.32,5.63,3.18,0.64,2.23,0.32,17.2,0.64,16.45,3.29,2.44,2.02,5.1,1.17,5.1,0.11,4.78,3.4,1.38,1.91,1.59,0.21,0,0,0,0,10.93,6.26,0.53,0,0.21,0.21,3.82,4.67,0.21,0,0.53,0,1.38,0,0,1.38,5.1,0.64,0.11,4.35,0.11,0,1.38,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.21,0.74,0.42,0,0.32,0,0.11,0.11,0.42,6.69,7.86,0.32,1.17,4.56,0.53,0.85,0.85,3.72,3.72,5.1,0.96,1.06,0.64,0.32,0.11,0,15.92,5.63,3.72,0.53,0.64,2.97,2.44,
Transform local software into online software,"We've developed a management software specifically to very small businesses. But, unexpectedly, several bigger businesses liked it and started to use it. The problem is that our software works only locally (one store) and the bigger businesses want us to make the software to work online (two or more stores at different places but with the same database). So, we would like to make our local software to work online, utilizing our already existent JAVA Swing user interface. We've thought about some solutions but,  as it will be a big change, we would like to know what is the best way to proceed. Important information: The user interface is JAVA Swing and the database is Postgresql. We have thousands of customers using our software and they would like to use it online too. Below are the solutions that we've thought about. Please, let us know if there is a better way. Solution #1 A single database in internet and all clients connected to it. Drawbacks: Solution #2 All clients would have their own database in internet, with different passwords. Drawbacks: Solution #3 A single database in internet, but clients connecting through a web service that validates the customers login data and returns the queries results. Drawbacks: Solution #4 There would exist a single database in the internet for all our customers. Also, all the clients would have their own database locally, so they could do fast select queries. Every update query would be firstly sent to a web service that would execute the query at the online database and return if it were successfully done. Besides that, we would have a mechanism to synchronize the local databases with the online database from time to time. Drawbacks: Is there a better way? How?I would go with Solution #3. Build a database-backed service/API, and have the desktop client authenticate itself and use it. I would avoid having a local database as in Solution #4. You cannot rely on your users not to accidentally mess with it somehow and cause synchronization to be lost or corrupted. In addition, having a local database will slow you down when you want to create a different client, for example a mobile app.

If you decide to go with Solution #3, the current de facto standard is JSON-based REST API. Also, you should note that there are many caching techniques that can be used which will reduce the number of queries actually run.",,,,,1,408,56.33,82.38,43.05,54.49,17,25,93.14,68.38,54.9,10.78,6.37,0.49,3.43,1.47,0,0.98,4.41,15.93,8.33,3.43,11.76,10.78,6.13,6.37,0.49,17.89,8.33,5.39,8.58,3.43,4.17,0.98,19.12,1.23,17.89,5.39,2.94,4.9,1.47,0.25,4.17,0,3.68,2.94,0.74,1.47,1.47,0,0,0,0,0,9.07,0.49,0.25,0.25,0,0.25,0,8.09,0,0,0,0,9.31,0.25,0,9.07,5.64,0,0,5.15,1.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.49,0,0,0,0,0.25,0.25,0.25,6.37,8.33,0,2.21,7.11,0,0,0,2.7,2.7,3.19,0.74,0,0,0,0,0,15.69,5.64,4.17,0.49,0,0.74,4.66,

URL for forum and gallery,"I am starting with installing the Gallery. I will install the Forum later only. Now, I am a little confused how to set the URL correctly for the Gallery now with the option for the Forum later.



	I uploaded everything on my server under the folder name Gallery, but now, found a similar site that has both, and the gallery url is site/forum/gallery/ and the forum is site/forum/



	As I am not live yet, I can still make changes. Is there a way to have the gallery as site/gallery, and later have site/forum when I add it? What confuses me is the fact that the whole Invision suite is likely installed only in ONE location, right?Assuming you install your community at site.com, that will be the location where your default application is accessed. In your case, that will initially be Gallery. Once you install the forums app, that will be at site.com/forums unless you switch that to the default app, in which case Gallery becomes located at site.com/gallery.



	Where you've seen sites with both /gallery and /forums addresses, some other app will have been set as the default. If you intentionally installed your community at, say, site.com/forums, your other apps would contain that path too, giving you site.com/forums/gallery, and so on.The folder you place the software in on your server will be a static constant in your URL, meaning if you install at site.com/gallery, it will always be site.com/gallery/(whatever application/page you're accessing and gallery would be duplicated in the URL if it is not the default application). Our software rewrites URLs to be more human friendly (if you enable that) to accomplish what @Meddysong is talking about so that if you install in a folder called gallery and run gallery as your default application but also have forums installed, you would see it at site.com/gallery/forums (or vice versa if you install in a folder called forums).



	If you do not have a website at the root of your domain (e.g. site.com), nor do you plan to have one, it would be suggested to install there for URLs that make the most sense.



	Example: our community here is installed at the root of our domain (https://invisioncommunity.com/) and we have set our CMS application (Pages) as the default application to generate content for our marketing website so that everything in that application can be set to the root. The software then puts the forums application at https://invisioncommunity.com/forums . If we had Gallery installed here it would then be at https://invisioncommunity.com/gallery .



	Now, if you want forums as the default application, this would be it at the root of your domain (site.com) and then gallery would be at site.com/gallery or vice versa.



	Hope that makes sense.OK, I must have changed something, because I seem to have confused things further for myself.



	I currently have a folder ""forum"", on the root where Invision is installed. I likely made a naming mistake because I am not YET installing the forum. Can/Should I just change ""forum"" to ""gallery"" on the root?The answer to this would be that it depends on what you wish to see. If you rename it to gallery, you would then have gallery/gallery in some places or gallery/forums



	If you are looking for only /forum and /gallery you would need to move to root. Is this what you are looking to do?



	If you are, you would move all your files and folders out of the forum folder to root, then edit your conf_global.php file to change the URL (removing the /forum/ part of things)On 8/30/2022 at 10:51 AM,   Marc Stridgen said: 

	
		
			If you are looking for only /forum and /gallery you would need to move to root. Is this what you are looking to do?
		
	



	Yes, that is what I want. I want the /gallery to be the link for now (/forum will be when I add the forum, later this year). Currently, this is what I have:



	


	What/where do I move to the root? Isn't that already on the root?



	 



	EDIT: Oh, I see that file now, and see where the URL has to match. I replaced the /forum by /gallery in the folder and in that conf_global.php file and it is now showing mysite/gallery correctly. Yay!! Thanks!

Unable to add Stripe payment method (Webhook Error),"Hello, 


	I'm currently trying to add Stripe as a payment method on my site.


	I've filled out everything correctly & for whatever reason I keep getting the exact same error. 


	I've tried by listening to all events on the Stripe webhook, and then just listening to the events that show in the error below. All attempts give me this error.


	In the setup guide for Stripe I did notice that the webhook link in the screenshots was an HTTPS://, not an HTTP:// so I'm not sure if this is part of the problem. My site is fully secure & I even got another SSL certificate as I thought that might be the fix.


	If anyone has had this issue or has any clue why this is happening please let me know.


	Thanks""There is not a webhook set up or it does not have all required event types enabled. The following events are required: source.chargeable, charge.succeeded, charge.faild, charge.dispute.created and charge.dispute.closed""


	There is this error for a reason, did you trying finding them and than fixing them?

	If you still have errors, you can contact me privately and I can have a look for you, maybe I can help you out.Stripe should require HTTPS as well for your site to run properly.I believe Jim is correct that Stripe requires full SSL connectivity (https://).



	That reference to http rather than https in the screenshot is odd.



	Does your conf_global.php specify http://  and you have a server-level redirect to https://  in .htaccess or similar?



	If so, that may be the problem.



	The conf_global.php file controls URL reference.



	Make sure it specifies https:// for the URL to the site and also make sure that there are no redirects of http to https in place at the server level.

Please revert these to their defaults and test in the first instanceAll uncaught exceptions are reported to IPS automatically (when opted in), right? Is it really too much to ask that when I report an exception, you check whether that exception is widespread?



	The problem here is not the changes that I made to this code (which were put in place to address other similar issues, although I don't know if they are still relevant). As far as I can tell, Google made a breaking change to their API to cause this. I'll add it to the list of modifications that I make to IPS files.On 8/20/2022 at 10:29 AM,   Colonel_mortis said:

	No. It logs high level statistics not every single exception.

	It does also report exceptions 🙂

		) );
		
		if ( $response->httpResponseCode == 410 )

	}Again from a high level statistical level. It’s not meant to be a proactive debug and engage tool. 🙂 



	That would most likely come with a HUGE price tag. If people are complaining about the cost of cloud hosting, just imagine the cost it would take to provide proactive eyes on glass monitoring.

	I'm not proposing that they proactively monitor all exceptions reported by everyone (although I do think that with the right architecture (clearly they should not look at every single individual log) it would be feasible with minimal overhead, and fairly valuable).



	All I am asking for here is that when someone reports a bug relating to an uncaught exception, IPS support use the logs to see whether it's a widespread issue or just isolated to the reporter, and handle it accordingly.



	If the logs aren't being used for proactive or reactive error investigation, I'm struggling to see why they bother to collect them at all.Please understand that techs responding to support queries may not be developers  themselves. We would not confirm through code or logs if we have seen items such as that, as they may well be unrelated in nature. When there are known problems in areas however, we would see them in our bug reports.



	The IPS Diagnostics are for general patterns, rather than specific instances. For example, if we see x happening repeatedly in y area on z occasions, we may decide as a company that area needs to be looked into at a higher level than simply fixing one bug. 



	I understand your are a developer yourself, and I understand the frustration entirely. However we simply cant go through peoples individual code. You are running custom code in that area, and also not running the latest release. I understand you have checked code differences between 4.7.0 and 4.7.1, but we dont support altered code as per our support terms, and while we of course will make common sense exceptions for this (and Im sure you will agree we have in your case on many occasions), there was no information given there.

	Its only since the last update too as i've never had a problem before.



	Any help please to fix would be great. Thanks.Any update or thoughts to please? This feels like a bug so would be good to know what I need to do to trial and fix please Invision.



	I noticed this morning that on my mobile the unread content stayed there, however i've just looked at the site via my PC and there is nothing there.Is this in the right support forum to get a response from Invision? I usually get a quick response on the day but its been nearly 3 days now and i'm not seen anybody pick it up. I don't know how else to escalate it. The same thing happened again today btw.

	Thanks for coming back to me Marc - I apologise if I was being a little urgent in my response as I don't know how many people are affected by this.



	So, I think the only things that I can remember happening to this to make it unique are as follows:



		I'm now on a new PC (old one I used every day has not been switched on since and won't be)
	
	
		I access it via Google Chrome on my Android mobile, just as i was beforehand.
	
	
		I believe I did hit 'Mark Site Read' initially on my PC. I believe that stops all stuff before that not showing up but after that it should still show posts even on threads that thought i had 'seen' previous posts in the same thread.
	

	This morning, this is the Unread Activity button:



	 



	



	 



	But if I click the 'Activity' I can see at least two threads that have 'Unread' items(circled in blue):



	 



	



	 



	I've asked the Theme developer and he doesn't get the issue either. I've even completely closed down my browsers on my phone and cleared system cache too in the AdminCP.



	I really don't know what else I can do?Sorry, Im a little confused on this part. If you mark the site as read, there will indeed be no unread

	I knew this may confuse matters, but Mark Site Read is marking everything read up until that point when you you click. That was clicked nearly a week ago yet, there is new unread content like the screenshots above not showing in the Unread Content stream.



	Does that make sense? Is there something wrong with the Mark Site Read button and the Unread Content Stream connection perhaps?It does, however unfortunately I am still unable to replicate this in any way, and from what you have said there someone else has tried to replicate on your own site and also cant.

	Yeah, its extremely strange but as per the screenshots, the Unread Content Stream isn't working as intended. I've checked the logs on the stream and that seems to be working all okay.



	I'm not sure what else I can check because the Stream function isn't working as expected so it all points to a bug somehwhere in the system.



	I can happily open up a new topic and ask for more feedback to show if its not just me but i'm pretty sure its not just me...I'm starting to believe its been around way longer than recently, its more i've only noticed it lately as it keeps wiping my stream completely whereas from time to time the odd thread would be on the Unread stream and then weeks later I might notice that i've never seen it because it didn't populate in that stream. I have to currently go into each individual subforums to check whats new to read instead, which is for me becomes a more lengthy process as I read everything to ensure all is okay! 😅

	Thanks the advice Marc. To loop back around because I think it was right in case anyone else can help at all, here's what i've done since then.



		Deleted all tabs that had my site open
	
	
		Cleared my entire browsing history and cache on browser
	
	
		Logged out and deleted all remembered devices on my profile in the AdminCP
	
	
		Cleared System Cache
	

	Its unfortunately still happening - I read one Unread content that popped up and once i clicked on the Unread Activity button, there was nothing there to show, even though there is stuff it knows i haven't read.



	If anyone has any more options or solutions to try, please let me know.I notice in your screenshot that you have the time period to ""last visit"". Do the unread items show if you change that to say ""Anytime""? It might be that your last visit timestamp is being updated too soon.On 4/6/2022 at 10:18 AM,   Matt said:

	Omg, how on earth I didn't follow my own topic and see this i'll never know 🙈 😅



	Thanks @Matt, I actually think this is it, super grateful for your spot on this!



	....however this means its found why i can't do what i'm trying to do, which is pick 'Anytime' like here has.



	You can see the screenshot below hasn't got the 'Anytime' available! Would this be a theme bug or a setting in the AdminCP?



	Thanks in advance 😄UPDATE:



	I went into the default stream settings and I seem to have fixed it to say Anytime.



	


	 



	By just putting today's date in the latter box and leaving the one before empty.



	Just as a heads up, this seems to have solved it but I can categorically say I've never really been in here for years! Something must've knocked out the setting a few updates ago so may be worth a check for you guys at your end.

			Not sure that is going to work there. I have flagged this for our developers again
		
	



	You're right, i've been away for the weekend and realised the date doesn't work like that as it states 'Anytime' but still has the last date I set it as on there which was last week.



	Thanks for raising and hopefully a fix is found soon 🙂🤞The workaround I can only find to help ensure the Unread Content stream is working how we all expect it to, is going into the AdminCP every day and change the date to 'Today'. The last XX weeks/days stream doesn't work either because it looks like it remembers the date you set it in the AdminCP (I've proved this by changing it to show the last 20 weeks).



	I've also checked the default basic theme and the 'Anytime' option like we have here isn't available.



	Does the developer need any more info to help the fixing process?Ok, so you would actually set this to specific time period, and set it to a larger period than you need. By default this is 365 days. You can see it on ours for all time only because we are using elasticsearch.



	Bear in mind the stream is unread content, so would really be intended for short periods of time anyway. Even 365 days would be quite excessiveOn 4/28/2022 at 7:50 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

	Thanks Mark, I didn't think of a forward dated date so changing my workaround now, to the end of the year now to save me changing it daily for a bit.



	As for the fix, is this being looked into still? I've asked others on what has happened to their default stream and it has stayed as 'Last Visit', which means any update I do in the AdminCP won't override their own default stream they had saved once we found out this change has taken place.



	Clearly, it just seems to be the option Anytime is missing from the Admin side all of a sudden.There is no fix there. Its actually working as intended. You should have it set on ""Specific time period"" and set that. By default its set to 365 days.On 4/28/2022 at 9:32 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

	Oh, that really is surprising. I've not touched this setting, in probably ever. It all of a sudden changed in a recent update and now i'm changing it to this? I have changed it to what you mention and will monitor but please note that I chose that option after seeing it wasn't working and selected '20 weeks', only to see that it stored a date behind the scenes when I saved it so missed future content.



	Forgive me for asking and double checking, but Invision has this setting, which I'm sure we all had until recently:



	 



	



	 



	Yet, our website shows this.



	



	 



	This has to be something missing @Marc Stridgen, otherwise I would have the same option in the AdminCP surely?We're using ElasticSearch here, so we can use the 'Any time' option. MySQL just struggles, so we had to limit it to Specified Time Period > 365 days.


	 


if ( \IPS\Settings::i()->search_method === 'elastic' )
{
	$streamDateOptions['all'] = 'stream_date_type_all';
}I'm seein the same behaviour on a new install. How do I change it to 365 by default for all users?



	dont worry, found it, for some reason unread content didnt display anything in the ACP search

Update Eclipse with Android development tools v. 23,"I updated Eclipse with the new SDK tools (rev. 23), but now when Eclipse starts I receive the error: This Android SDK requires Android Developer Toolkit version 23.0.0 or above. Current version is 22.6.3.v201404151837-1123206. Please update ADT to the latest version. No updates were found with ""Check for updates"". If I try ""Install new software"", I can see version 23, but I can't upgrade due to the following error: After download of the last ADT from the web site, it seems there's another problem. With SDK Tools rev. 23 proguard is not installed, the folder SDK dir/tools/proguard is missing, and other tools are missing. This version contains several bugs.Google has released ADT v23.0.2. This solved many problems of previous ADT version 23.

Step-by-step:


Menu Help → Install New Software...
For ""Work with"", select the Android source https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse

Tick ADT v23.0 for installation, then click ""Next""
Eclipse will show ""Install Remediation Page"" since there is conflict with previous version. (If it does not, see below.) Select ""Update my installation to be compatible with items being installed"" to uninstall the old version and install the new one. After that, proceed with the usual steps.




Note: When I installed the new version of ADT, I didn't include the new version of ""Android Native Development Tools"" package. Instead, I installed the rest of packages first, and then installed ""Android Native Development Tools"". For a reason, if I try to install all the new packages including ""Android Native Development Tools"", the installation fails.

If there is no ""Remediation page"", the only way to remove the ADT plugin from Eclipse is to go to menu Help → About Eclipse → Installation Details and uninstall from there. But there is a risk of uninstalling Eclipse itself.Google response:

This is a packaging bug. The entire proguard file is missing. We'll have an update asap, but until then just copy it over from a previous version of the tools:


http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-linux.tgz
http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-windows.zip
http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-macosx.zip


and copy over the following files:


tools/hprof-conv 
tools/support/annotations.jar 
tools/proguard


So at the end if you started from a new ADT copy by hand the files :)

Edit: with the latest ADT release, the bundle should now work with auto-update, so install these new versions:


linux 64 bit vm: http://dl.google.com/android/adt/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702.zip

win64: http://dl.google.com/android/adt/adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20140702.zip


Don't try to upgrade from previous version because it doesn’t work at all.
If you have got problems with zipalign, it's now under build-tools and no more under tools/ so you can do a symbolic link or just copy it into the expected folder.None of the other answers worked for me using the ADT bundle published on developer.android.com. 

I ended up downloading the latest version of Eclipse (not the ADT bundle) and then installing the ADT plugin via menu Help → Install new software → entering https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse (mentioned by @RED_). 

I also had to update my workspace to point to my previous workspace, and most things seemed to be restored.

On a side note: This seems like a good time to migrate to Android Studio...NOTE: Use this approach with caution because this might break your Eclipse installation (see comments).

This might help you if you installed the ADT plugin manually. But if you are using the version of Eclipse from the Eclipse ADT Bundle the below steps could break your Eclipse installation, and you may not be able to use Eclipse again!

Go to

Menu Help → About Eclipse SDK → Installation Details.

Now you will see all 22.0 versions and then click Uninstall button at bottom.

After uninstallation goto:

Menu Help → Install New Software → enter http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

Then install all the things, and now it is ready.I was updating my build server today and came across the same issue. It has been reported here:
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=72419

The fix is in progress and the work around according to the project manager is:


  Please wait for an updated version within a day or two. Until then, your workaround is to do download one of
  
  http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-linux.tgz
  
  http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-windows.zip
  
  http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-macosx.zip
  
  and copy over the following files:

    tools/hprof-conv
    tools/support/annotations.jar
    tools/proguard

zipalign was missing for me too, check to see if you need to copy this as wellIt works for me :)

If for some reason you installed an ADT preview and need to revert back to the current stable, you can't use the dialog to install ""new"" software since what you want is actually an older one. Instead do this:


Open Help > About Eclipse... on Windows or Linux. On Mac, use the app's menu > About...
Click the ""Installation Details"" button.
Select the ""Installation History"" tab.
Select one of the previous configurations.
Click the ""Revert"" button at the bottom.is what they are saying about this:

OK, guys, sorry about all this trouble, and we apologize for the messed up releases. Here's the summary:


There is no way to update an existing ADT bundle that you might have downloaded.

Ran the new Eclipse, Luna, and updated the workspace
Installed the ADT plugin (Help -> Install New Software)
Restarted Eclipse
DoneThere is a lot of confusion going around in this thread. There are two solutions depending on how you installed ADT.


If you installed the ADT plugin manually then I believe you can use the ""Delete ADT"" -> ""Install New Software"" approach.
If you are using the ADT Bundle then do not follow that solution! You will break Eclipse. Here is an update from a Google member - read #18: 

https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=72912


You must download a new version of the ADT-Bundle (yep, it's frustrating!).Just uninstall the previous ADT.
Go to menu Help → About Eclipse → Installation Details
Uninstall all plugins which Id start with com.android.ide
Install ADT again from the update site.DO NOT DO THIS

Warning: Please see the comments below this answer. These steps have had a negative impact for many people.


Click Help / Install new software...
Click on What is ""already installed"" (as in picture below)
In the new window you can uninstall the old ADT (uninstall Android Development Tools, Android DDMS, Android Hierarchy Viewer, Android TraceView, Android Native Development Tools and Tracer for OpenGL ES)
Restart Eclipse
Then again click on Help / Install New Software
Choose ADT... Install 


I hope it helps!After trying the approaches in other answers without success, I just installed a new bundle from http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=adt and that worked fine.

Do the following:


As you don't want to re-download all the platforms again, copy the existing one from /OLD_ANDROID_SDK_PATH/sdk/platforms to /NEW_ANDROID_SDK_PATH/sdk/platforms.
When opening the new Eclipse from the recent downloaded bundle, make sure you reuse the previous 'workspace' folder. That will ensure that all your previous settings will be remembered.
After opening the new Eclipse on the previous workspace, please check if the used Android SDK is pointing to the new one (Eclipse preferences -> Android). It might be pointing to the old one, as you've reused the previews workspace settings.


With these steps, you should't have to reconfigure everything, and you won't need to spend time troubleshooting this BUG on this upgrade from Google Developers.

Good luck! ;-)You need to uninstall the old version and install 23

uninstall:
Help > about Eclipse SDK > Installation Details 
select Android related packages to uninstall

And then install V23.There is no way to update an existing ADT bundle that you might have downloaded.

Starting with ADT bundle 23.0.2, you should be able to update to future versions of ADT.I was getting the same ""conflicting dependency"" error on Mac OS X 10.9.3 and simply upgrading was not an option.  What finally worked was downloading the latest Eclipse ADT bundle zip file from developer.android.com, extracting it and moving only ""eclipse"" folder to the place where my old eclipse folder was. (extracting the Eclipse ADT bundle zip file will give you ""eclipse"" and ""sdk"" folders).

If you decide to go the same route, first make sure you know what your Workspace path is. This can be found in Preferences.  Then rename your old ""eclipse"" directory (not Eclipse.app) to something like eclipse-22.6.3, then move extracted ""eclipse"" folder into its place. Run new Eclipse.app inside, and when it asks you about Workspace, just enter the same path as you noted above.  Or it can also be set later in Preferences.

Maybe worth adding is that to re-enable Android SDK Manager and Android Virtual Device Manager choose Window -> Customize Perspective -> Command Groups Availability and select Android SDK and AVD Manager. This will add these 2 items to the ""Window"" menu item for the current perspective (Java).

I didn't move the extracted ""sdk"" folder, because I already had sdk folder in the same directory as eclipse, which I have already updated to the latest Android tools. But if it makes you feel safer, you can also rename your old sdk folder (for backup purposes) and move the freshly extracted one into its place.I faced the same problem and solved it. You need to uninstall the Android plugin entirely from within Eclipse (from the ""about"" section..), including trace view..

Then added the ADT Plugin again (https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/) and install it.

The problem is solved!

I guess it's a bug with the SDK manager or ADT Plugin update mechanism...How to update from 22.xx.x to 23.0.2 (my solution).  This will beat the dependency issues.

I was suffering from this issue for days, and I have tried every single solution on this link, but no luck. I finally figured out a solution that actually works!

Please note that this solution works in Windows 7 (64 bit). It should probably work for other Windows operating systems.

Here we go:


download the latest ADT bundle from

http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download
unzip it and open ""eclipse"" folder --> ""plugins"" folder
Now go to your old eclipse and open ""eclipse"" folder --> ""plugins"" folder, and copy everything inside.
Now paste them into the ""plugins"" folder of the (NEW ECLIPSE), but DO NOT overwrite anything.
While inside of the ""plugins"" folder of your new Eclipse, do the search. Type in 22. (notice 22 with a dot) and hit enter.
The search result will show up all the files or folders with .....22.6...... For example,

com.android.ide.eclipse.adt_**22.6.2**.v201403212031-1085508

Highlight all of these files/folders and hit delete key.
Make sure to update your old API/SDK to the latest version and load this sdk directory to work with your new eclipse.


or

You can watch this video, which shows you how to move all your SDK/API to your new SDK folder.

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPZpJdnbbN0

I have not tried to update from any other ADT versions, but I think it should work for any old ADT versions too.

Don't forget to backup stuff before attempting.What I have just found is that you need to update your ADT plugin in your Eclipse (whether stand alone or ADT Bundle) before updating your build tool.

If your Eclipse installation points to the most recent Build Tool and your Eclipse is having ADT 22.x, it will show those errors.

What worked for me: (on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit)  


Installed an older version of Eclipse and ADT (from the Bundle)
This copy of Eclipse was pointing to an older SDK verion with old build tools (before 20)
Updated the ADT to v23 (via archive, in my case)
Pointed Eclipse to the latest version of build tools.


You may not have an older copy of Eclipse and Build tools, in that case you can uninstall latest build tool from SDK Manager and install the older copy.

Once everything starts working fine, do the above steps.

I am trying to upload older copies of such bundles somewhere on the Internet, will update the links here, once I am done uploading.I found these instructions in a comment.

Download the newest version of ADT and use your existing workspace.  This is actually the least pain-full upgrade you'll ever do.  It didn't mess with the .android folder so I still had my original debug key.  Only things missing were a couple of add ons I hardly ever use and they are easily installed into the new version.  

Note don't install into your existing adt folder create a new folder so you can still fall back if the new install doesn't work.On ADT-bundled Eclipse I had to first uninstall the ADT and then do a fresh install.

To remove the ADT plugin from Eclipse:


Go to menu Help → About Eclipse → Installation Details.
Select ADT plug-in, then click Uninstall.
After uninstallation install ADT from Help → Install new software.For me it helped to delete Android 4.4W which is also API 20 and might be a cause for the conflict. So only install Android 4.4W or Android L until they fix it.

And (again this might only be for me) it only works in Android Studio not in Eclipse ...I had to delete ADT and install it again.

However be warned, this caused me and one other person to have an annotations.jar missing errors in the Java Build path for certain projects, probably because it was trying to look for an old SDK, so upgrading projects is the next step I have to take.

The errors relate to libraries mostly, Google Play Services, Facebook SDK, ActionBarCompat.

For this step, you uninstall ADT, then put the URL back in to download them. The url is: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipseI found a solution for the problem with ""conflicting dependency"". I don't have the same page of Daniel Díaz's response, but a page show ""conflicting dependency"", and I can't make anything.

The problem is that I'm not the owner of the file. Eclipse was installed in other session (on OS X). I have the right to read and write the Eclipse file, but I'm not the owner. Make a ""chown"" command on all Eclipse files to solve the problem. After, I have the same result as Daniel Diaz. 

I hope this helps someone.WARNING

There is now an update for ADT 23.0.1, but the Windows and Linux scripts are messed up, so wait with the upgrade!

You could check for example tools/proguard/bin/*.sh in http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r23.0.1-windows.zip.I did this to solve the same issue (in OS X):


Help > Install New Software > Add or select this repository ""http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.3"" 
Under ""Eclipse platform"" select the newest version of Eclipse.
The installer will ask if you want to uninstall the ADT, click finish.
Restart Eclipse and install ONLY the ADT 23 using this repository: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse.
Restart Eclipse and install DDMS, Hierarchy Viewer, Trace View etc.
Restart Eclipse again.


Hope it helps.If Eclipse gives an error after uninstalling the ADT plugin from your Eclipse installation, try to edit file config.ini in the Eclipse folder → configuration. Find:

eclipse.application=


And change it to:

eclipse.application=org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench


I hope it works for you too.I simply went to my Android resources folder on my C:/ drive (C:/Android), deleted the 'eclipse' folder and all its contents. I downloaded Android Developer Tools once more and just moved over the 'eclipse' folder.

I started up and everything was fine; I had updated to version 23.

Hopefully this helps, possibly not suitable for everyone as some of you have Eclipse modifications but for someone who, like me, wanted a quick fix and get back to developing this seemed to be the easiest path.I am using Eclipse v4.3 (Kepler), and this is how I solved my problem.

Goto menu Help → Install new software → click Add.

In the popup, give any name (I named it as Eclipse ADT Plugin), and in the link's place, use https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

Once you click OK, you will be displayed with new packages that will be installed and old packages that will be deleted. Don't worry about these packages. Click OK.

New packages will be installed, and this should solve your problem.I updated Eclipse with the new SDK tools (rev. 23), but now when Eclipse starts I receive the error:

This Android SDK requires Android Developer Toolkit version 23.0.0 or above. Current version is 22.6.3.v201404151837-1123206. Please update ADT to the latest version.

No updates were found with ""Check for updates"". If I try ""Install new software"", I can see version 23, but I can't upgrade due to the following error:

Cannot complete the install because of a conflicting dependency.

After download of the last ADT from the web site, it seems there's another problem.

With SDK Tools rev. 23 proguard is not installed, the folder SDK dir/tools/proguard is missing, and other tools are missing. This version contains several bugs.Google response:

This is a packaging bug. The entire proguard file is missing. We'll have an update asap, but until then just copy it over from a previous version of the tools:


http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-linux.tgz
http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-windows.zip
http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-macosx.zip


and copy over the following files:


tools/hprof-conv 
tools/support/annotations.jar 
tools/proguard


So at the end if you started from a new ADT copy by hand the files :)

Edit: with the latest ADT release, the bundle should now work with auto-update, so install these new versions:

I ended up downloading the latest version of Eclipse (not the ADT bundle) and then installing the ADT plugin via menu Help → Install new software → entering https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse (mentioned by @RED_). 

I also had to update my workspace to point to my previous workspace, and most things seemed to be restored.

On a side note: This seems like a good time to migrate to Android Studio...NOTE: Use this approach with caution because this might break your Eclipse installation (see comments).

This might help you if you installed the ADT plugin manually. But if you are using the version of Eclipse from the Eclipse ADT Bundle the below steps could break your Eclipse installation, and you may not be able to use Eclipse again!

Go to

Menu Help → About Eclipse SDK → Installation Details.

Now you will see all 22.0 versions and then click Uninstall button at bottom.

After uninstallation goto:

Menu Help → Install New Software → enter http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

Then install all the things, and now it is ready.I was updating my build server today and came across the same issue. It has been reported here:
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=72419

The fix is in progress and the work around according to the project manager is:


  Please wait for an updated version within a day or two. Until then, your workaround is to do download one of
  
  http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-linux.tgz
  
  http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-windows.zip
  
  http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-macosx.zip
  
  and copy over the following files:

			Btw, I've just paid for the renew, but the email support isn't active. Did I miss something and there's no support through tickets anymore?
		
	



	There is no longer support through email any longer, outside of the first 30 days of self-license purchase. You should have received an email about this last year. While there is no email support, you found our fully staffed support forum where the same, exact support will take place 🙂 . It is merely just a change in where support is started, not a change in benefits as technicians still have the opportunity to securely see your access details in the Client Area and, if required, escalate a ticket to our developers for further investigation.



	We noticed that a large majority of questions coming were very common and often, not relating to the core software so adding these to a common area which can be searched would help clients receive a faster answer to their question/issue. Additionally, there is the benefit of other clients with similar issues helping resolve your issue too.

	I've checked a few previous installations before post here, it seems like I never had this table. I've bought Pages recently, but I didn't delete the app.



	What should I do to fix the issue?



			
				


	Edited August 25 by BIgnatBtw, I didn't open phpmyadmin for a few years. Also, there were no issue with the recent updates.You can try starting the upgrade over and omitting Pages if you've never had it installed. Then we can investigate afterwards what may have happened. However, at this point in the upgrade, the system is looking for something which is installed that is not in the database.On 8/25/2022 at 1:08 PM,   Jim M said:

	I mean that I bought and installed Pages a few months ago. So, that's the first upgrade since I've got Pages. I had no issues upgrading my board in the past.

	I am not quite sure what you mean. The two solutions to move forward are:



		You restore your database to when these tables existed.
	
	
		You restore your database to the backup taken just before your upgrade attempt here and then try the upgrade again but do not check the checkbox for Pages during the upgrader. Then once everything has upgraded, uninstall Pages (and re-install if you plan to utilize) or let us know if you have any issues with doing any of that.Ok, thanks, I'll try!On 8/25/2022 at 1:15 PM,   Jim M said:

	It helped. I restored the database, then updated the board without updating Pages, and then uninstalled Pages.

	The question is, how can I install it back? 🙂 Pages didn't appear in the bottom app's list.

Upgrade & Configuration Error,"Hello, 



	I upgraded to the newest version. The system checker had all green checks, but mentioned the recommendation to upgrade to PHP 8.0. (I have not done this as I know it will create issues I cannot manage right now, and my main concern is getting my community up and going and take care of my customers/community).

	Initially there were no problems with my upgrade. I checked and everything was working normally. 

	But when I woke up the next morning and checked I had an error and several community members saying the community is broken.  I've been having some other issues related to MySQL. And usually I have been able to get the community back up and running by using terminal and doing a stop/start of the MySQL database. 

	But that didn't work. 


	Here is the error I am getting:

	Can you give me some pointers?  I'd like to get my community back up and running ASAP, and solve some of the ongoing issues once and for all.


	many thanks,



	Toddalso, this seems important so I wanted to post it here.As mentioned in the message there, you are actually missing tables 


IPS\Db\Exception: Table 'bandbldr_wp365.core_item_member_map' doesn't exist in engine (1932)


	and


IPS\Db\Exception: Table 'bandbldr_wp365.core_editor_stored_replies' doesn't exist in engine (1932)


	It may be those tables are crashed, or missing entirely. If they are missing you will need to restore those from a working backup. If crashed, your hosting company would need to assist you with this.Hey @Marc Stridgen



	Thanks for the response. Perhaps the table was there before the upgrade, then after the upgrade it was missing or incompatible with the new version?   But it's strange that it wouldn't serve me the error immediately after the upgrade.


	If I don't have backups, is there a way for somebody to create/build the necessary table(s)? Or are these tables automatically created?   


	The reason I posted here, was because I spoke to my hosting company and they said I should ask Invision. I discussed further with a developer who has helped me from time to time. He said he couldn't find anything about how to fix this issue and he also said I should post here and ask. 


	Hmm.  I hate to go back to them empty handed. They knew the table was missing. 


	I did a ""repair database"" to see if that might clear up something and it uncovered a few more missing tables. (copy paste below)

	this leads me to believe that they existed before but somehow were removed.  Any ideas on how that could happen?  

	So if somehow I can get those tables re-created, are you confident that it would fix the issue and get the community back up and running?

	 



	In the interest of time, it would be much appreciated if you could take a look under the hood? You mentioned to me in another post here - that you couldn't get on my community ACP because the credentials are not correct.  Can you tell me where I can find that in the AdminCP?  I looked everywhere and couldn't find where I update those details. 


	thanks,



	ToddIm not sure where you get the impression there that they were removed. What actually looks to be the case there is that there is an issue with your mysql instance. It is looking to repair tables in which the physical files are not present. After all, if they are not there, why would it be trying to repair them otherwise? There is only your hosting company that can resolve that, and only a restore from backup will correct the issue at this point. Its quite  few tables you are missing thereI figured they were part of the existing database and the repair the database tool couldn't find them. And the only new action that had happened since then was the update of the IPBoard software. So I figured that new software installation removed those tables. 


	Is there something else that would cause those tables to be removed?


	If I don't have a backup, then what can my hosting company do?



	Does this mean my 3 years worth of community is destroyed? Or can tables be re-built?


	ToddThere is an issue with your mysql instance is what has caused your issue. The problem is the tables must exist at least in some form as your mysql instance is trying to repair them. It wouldnt know of their existence otherwise.



	You could attempt to get blank copies of those tables from another instance if you wanted to see if you can create them. However you will be missing data from it. Have you contacted your hosting company to see if they have backups themselves?Yes I already discussed the backup with my hosting company.

	the tech said, ""oh, I see you don't have our add-on backup plan"". 

	I replied ""I didn't know you offered a backup plan. I use a daily backup plugin, will that help?""

	the tech replied ""no, that only backs up wordpress files"". 

	They do not have backups. 


	ToddYou could create a test instance and copy the empty versions of the tables as mentioned, but of course there is no guarantee you wont have issues.OK, is this something my hosting company can do?, or is it more of a ""web developer"" skill?



	Do you have any formate for an ""empty version"", or will the host/developers know what that is?


	ToddI can certainly script out those tables and send them to you (I will do that shortly). You can then attempt to restore them that way and see how you goFeel free to try this. Note, this is outside the scope of support.

COMMIT;Hey @Marc Stridgen


	I've been doing these UpDraft backups for years thinking all along that my MySQL database was being backed up. Only today did I learn that UpDraft only backs up WP files.  

	But look at this screenshot... Is there a chance that the ""database"" I point to are the backups that have those tables?  

	I tried to download/unpack those but couldn't find anything that looked like php files. 

	See screenshot of the backup plugin and let me know what you think?




	thanks,

	This is much appreciated @Marc Stridgen  Above and beyond.  

	I will pass this along to my host tech and see if he can fix it.

	and fair enough. It's above my head (obviously 😂)  But just thought I would try, in the case that it would save you from creating the empty tables. 


	I will update this thread after either my host tech or developer implements the empty tables.



	ToddIt is worth asking, have you ever considered our cloud solution? If you are not knowlegable in anything related to your hosting, including backups, it may be a much better direction for you. You would never need to think about things like this again. You just think about running your site insteadHey @Marc Stridgen

	There is a membership education company (Membership Academy) that turned me on to IP Board 4 years ago. I loved using it in their community, and wanted to implement it when I built mine (launched October 2019). 

	At the time, I told my developer I want it setup the exact same way Membership Academy had theirs setup. And so he did it.  

	I really didn't consider any other option, and I certainly never thought I would be on with tech support or this forum. None of this stuff ever occurred to me. I set out to build a business in education, not mess with tech. I think the reason my developer hasn't been involved is simply because of the support security not allowing him to do tech support on my behalf. Somehow I was the only one that could communicate with support. 


	So is it possible to use the Cloud solution at this point?  Or would I lose my 3 years of community activity in the process of transferring?  I really can't do that, because the community discussions are tied directly to the course/academy. It's become a resource people count on and continue to reference.  


	If you tell me it's easy and I can transfer everything to your Cloud service and keep the stuff I have, then I'm ready to go.  

	What are the requirements?


	ToddYes, your current community can indeed be transferred over to our cloud environment. I will get a ticket created for you for our sales team, who are better placed to discuss specifics with you. Based on what you have said there, you can then simply concentrate on running your business, rather than thinking about backups, mysql etc.Thank you for posing this option @Marc Stridgen

	I hope it allows me to do just that.  Look forward to hearing from the sales team.

Upgrade Stalled Out,"I went to update my forums and when I did the upgrade stalled out. The message I'm getting is the following:




	I haven't done anything with that Db.php file in the past and didn't have the issue, I'm not sure why I'm having it now. I checked the settings for the file and I don't see any issues.Please go to the Client Area and download a fresh set of files then extract these to your local computer. Once done, upload these to your server, overwriting what is there.



	Unfortunately, that file is either modified, out of date, or inaccessible by PHP. If the permissions are good on the file per your server's configuration, you will need to ensure it is not modified or out of date. I'm afraid, there is no other way to get around this safely.So update ALL the files, all the system files folder files, or just the Db.php file?



	I just tried the Db.php file and it didn't work



	 



	 



			
				


	Edited July 11 by GreatAdventureHistoryYou would only need to do Db.php . Please ensure it is in the correct directory, however 🙂 .



	If you continue to have issue, please update the access details on file in the Client Area:



	
		We would need to look further into this for you, however the access details on file appear to be incorrect or missing. Could you please update these details by visiting your client area, selecting the relevant purchase, then clicking ""Review/Update Access Information"" under the ""Stored Access Information"" section. 
	

	
		We look forward to further assisting you.It appears to be in the correct directory. I just updated the stored access information.Unfortunately, the FTP information is still incorrectI just generated a new password and login and updated the stored access information againConnection is being refused by the server. Its not actually getting as far as the credentials.



	I would say here however, you need to check that file, as its either not present or out of date.I have now replaced the Db.php file three times and confirmed it was the correct location and version and each time the same issue has occurred showing the same error message. I don't know what else I can do.Please check the owner of the file, not just the permissions.



	It may be owned by the wrong user, such as root or other.



	It should be owned by the same account that the other files in that folder are set to.Where do I find the ""Owner"" of the file?



	I have checked several times now and the file is definitely the ""new"" version uploaded:



	



	I set the permissions to match what the previous version had:You won't be able to see the file owner when using cPanel's file manager.



	The easiest way to see the file owner is to use an FTP client such as Filezilla (it's free) and view the directory listing where that file is located. 



	



	The two values I obfuscated in red (since it's my install) are the Owner/Group.



	Make sure all files in that folder have the same owner and permissions.



	It's also possible your server is blocking that file for some reason, and if the file is there but set to 0000 permissions for example, you would have to talk to your Host.OK-- I confirmed the owner/group and permissions are all correct. Still getting the same error message.Could you please provide us FTP/SFTP access and we can take a closer look?I have updated the Access information again, hopefully this time it works.I am only seeing select files have been uploaded to your server from 4.7. Please go to the Client Area and download a full set of files then extract these to your local computer and upload the contents of the ""ips_****"" folder to your server, overwriting what is there. Once that is done, please go to /admin/upgrade and try the upgrader again.OK- I uploaded the files and its still having the same issueYou will need to contact your hosting company for assistance on this one. We are not seeing the file for some reason, which is why you are getting that message coming up.

	  Expand  



	I’m a little confused by their statement here. A 403 error shouldn’t be caused by this. 403 would mean there is a permission error on the server and thus cannot access the file and therefore run. Could you please have them clarify?Also to further build on what Jim is saying...  



	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403



	A 403 code means the request was forbidden by the server.  It does not trigger during code level execution.  It's blocked on inbound access.  (Meaning someone typed in www.yourdomain.com/some/file.php and the server blocked access to it for some reason such as mod_security or another firewall denying the request.  



	Also as an aside... the line of code he's referencing (#120 of Db.php) is the same code that has been used before the upgrade.  It's what tells PHP how to connect to mySQL.  



	If it really was problematic, it would mean the board never worked even before attempting to upgrade and you could have never logged into the ACP in the first place.  



	So that sounds to me like a BS answer from the provider that either does not know what they're saying or is just not wanting to look into it.  Either way, it's not a correct answer from them.So, they ""investigated"" again and now we're getting this error message:

Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ':', expecting ';' or '{' in /home/gah537/public_html/GreatAdventureHistory/Forums/init.php on line 957



	They say they had nothing to do with this issue now:
I would like to inform you that we do not have n access to your file and content to make any changes as the system won't allow as due to security reasons. However, I can see that there are no issues with the server. The Syntax error is coding/scripting I request you to please check with your website developer on this to get this fixed., I hope you understand my limitations.This is because your PHP version is set to PHP 5.6.

Upgrade failed - SQL error?,"Hey all, 


	I have 4 forums with Invision and 3 have upgraded no problem but 1 is not working. 


	When I try to upgrade via the ACP it tells me to manually download and upload the upgrade. I've done so but when I try to continue the upgrade I get the following error - 

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '/cms_custom_database_1 SET record_publish_date = record_saved, record_future_dat' at line 1 

	 


I tried uploading the whole package instead, but it then tells me to run the install using a new database prefix which results in a new blank forum. 

So I'm a bit stuck. All my forums are with the same server/host company so not sure why there is this problem on one. Any help much appreciated! 



			
				


	Edited August 19 by LaurieMatthewThe problem is that you're using a forward slash as a table prefix and as such it's part of the table name. 



	I would recommend renaming the tables to remove the / and then edit conf_global.php and change 


'sql_tbl_prefix' => '/',


	to


'sql_tbl_prefix' => '',


	Then go back to <url>/admin/upgrade to finish the upgrade.On 8/19/2022 at 7:27 AM,   Stuart Silvester said:

	Hi thanks for that 🙂


	I've gone into myPHP but when I attempt to change the prefix from / to (blank) I get an error saying that the table already exists. 


	Is there another way that I can achieve this? 


	Or is it possible to upload the files to a new database with the correct blank prefix and then connect my content to that?

			I've gone into myPHP but when I attempt to change the prefix from / to (blank) I get an error saying that the table already exists. 
		
	



	It looks like you are editing the prefix in the phpmyadmin or some other databse management tool. The edit should be applied to the conf_global.php file. You can find that in the root of your forum folder. Hope it helps.Actually both. The table itself needs the prefix changing as well.



	If you are having that issue, you would need to contact your hosting company for assistanceOk thank you again, I did try the host and they suggested I contact the software devs. 

	 



	I’ll contact them again and see if I can get it changedNo problem. Good luck with getting the issue resolvedMost likely the table's file on disk doesn't have the slash and that's why you get the error about the table already existing.



	Instead of an empty prefix try using a different prefix like ipb_ or anything else really. That should solve your renaming issue. After the rename to ipb_tableName you should also be able to just change it back to tableName alone, too.



			
				


	Edited August 19 by teraßyteSo I got this sorted, it was indeed the / prefix causing the issue. The reason I couldn't rename the tables was that for some reason I had 2 complete sets, one with the / prefix and one without. 


	I deleted the tables without the /, I was then able to rename the / tables to no prefix. Edited the conf_global and hey presto - a working upgrade! 


	Thank you everyone for the help 🙂

	If you are still running 4.7.0, and the online updater is not letting you update4.7.1, you can download a fresh set of files from the client area, upload them to your site, and then run yourdomain.com/admin/upgrade.So it says im running Invision Community v4.7.0

	i left it for a few mintures on step 4, but it doesnt do anything.



	I had upgraded a search app to version 4.7.1 earlier. Maybe I should have upgraded IPS first before the app, could that have ruined it ?

Upgrading from 4.3 to latest instance,"I have a rather large forum that runs on Invision and I am looking to upgrade from my current version (which is old - version 4.3) to the latest version and was going to see if there are any major things I should be considering or known issues I might be running into or should this be relatively straight forward. This is a forum that has been on Invision since the early days of Invision.  Apologies - if there is an existing post or two that are already pretty detailed and someone can point to me that works fantastic as well (I couldn't find - but I will admit I don't check this site very often so might not have been looking / searching right way). 



	Thanks in advance!Depending on the server configuration, installed modifications, and how things are setup there can be a large number of different issues. Or if you're lucky (no modifications installed, etc) none at all.



	When a forum is several versions behind I usually suggest trying the upgrade on a test copy in order to see how it goes, and eventually fix any bugs you encounter so that you're ready for upgrading the live site with no surprises.



	Another thing would be checking which modifications and custom themes you use (if any) and see if there are updated versions of them for the suite version you're going to upgrade to. For example if a modification critical to keep your forum working is not updated you'd have to first reach out to its developer and see if they can update it. If they're not available you may need to update it yourself (if you know how) or you may need to hire a different developer to update it for you. There could also be modifications that aren't updated but that you don't mind losing either. Some modifications might still work without changes, but themes surely won't since they won't support all the new features IPS added.



	 



	As an example I recently upgraded a client's forum from 4.2 and beforehand I updated 3 custom modifications for them since the original developer wasn't available anymore. We also did a test upgrade and found some columns from old uninstalled modifications that caused errors during the upgrade process. Thanks to that we fixed the live site's database and ended up avoiding the error completely.



	 



	As I mentioned above anything can happen and there isn't really a list that covers known issues: the best way would be to compile your own list by making a test upgrade and seeing what happens directly.In addition to the above, you will want to ensure you can update your server to a compatible version of PHP. On this upgrade, you are likely to need to upload a fresh set of files and upgrade from /admin/upgrade. The reason for this is you are going to need to update to PHP 7.4 to upgrade, and Im not sure 4.3 will work on that version.



	In general



		Make sure you can obtain newer versions of any plugins/applications that are needed
	
	
		Make sure you can obtain newer versions of your theme
	
	
		Make sure your server can meet the latest minimum requirements
	
	
		Test if you can do so first
	
	
		Most importantly - Ensure you have full backups of both files and database, and that you can restore them to fully working order if something should go wrong.On the theme - if I don't have newer versions is that an issue - or more just the fact that I can go back to a standard theme and then in meantime (after the fact) kind of refresh a current theme (I presume the theme is almost a moot point given the fact that the changes from 4.3 up to 4.7 are so drastic or am I mistaken there).  



	Additionally - any context in terms of the time it might take to go through the various gyrations (I get it - it depends).  The good news I don't believe I have any custom plugins/applications - it is a pretty standard forum install with really the only customization the theme we have (including the various avatrs and images used within the theme/skin).  


	Sorry - one other question - is easiest way to test if the instances can handle to just do a fresh install of the forum software on my server. Basically if that works - than the server is set up with the right php, etc and than its really just a matter of making sure I actually do the upgrade right (or at least at that point - I will have narrowed down the issue, if one would arise, would be entirely driven by how I implemented the upgrade).On 8/23/2022 at 11:33 PM,   Bullsback said:

	You would just go to the standard theme in that scenario until you can either obtain one for 4.7 or create one for 4.7. You could update from 4.3 to 4.7 if you wish, but there would indeed be quite a lot of changes

	I think you answered your own question in the first line there. It really depends. For example, if you want to make a copy, its going to depend on whether you have a place to copy it to, the speed you are able to copy, and your own ability. To give an example of how impossible a question it is to answer, some may be able to copy their site in less than 5 minutes, where others it might take them an few hours or so to get a copy up and running.

	That would test if a new install works, not if an upgrade of your platform works. One thing you need to bear in mind there is its not 'if' the server is set up in the correct PHP version.

	Yes. Go to ACP, then go to the user's profile. Click edit password, and then use 'force user to change password'.

	That will send a link to their email address and ask them to change the password the next time they log in.

Voice Recognition Software For Developers [closed],"Questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, library or favorite off-site resource are off-topic for Stack Overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it. Closed 8 years ago. Well the docs finally said it, I need to take it easy on my wrist for a few months. Being that I'm a .NET Developer this could end my livelihood for a little while, something I'm not anxious to do. That said, are there any good handsfree options for developers?  Anyone had success using any of the speech recognition software out there? POSTSCRIPT: I've recovered my arm again to the point where two-handed programming isn't a problem.  Dragon Naturally speaking worked well enough, but was slower, not like the keyboard where I was programming faster than I thought.It's out there, and it works...

There are quite a few speech recognition programs out there, of which Dragon NaturallySpeaking is, I think, one of the most widely used ones. I've used it myself, and have been impressed with its quality. That being a couple of years ago, I guess things have improved even further by now.

...but it ain't easy...

Even though it works amazingly well, I won't say it's an easy solution. It takes time to train the program, and even then, it'll make mistakes. It's painstakingly slow compared to typing, so I had to keep saying to myself ""Don't grab the keyboard, don't grab the keyboard, ..."" (after which I'd grab the keyboard anyway). I myself tend to mumble a bit, which didn't make things much better, either ;-). Especially the first weeks can be frustrating. You can even get voice-related problems if you strain your voice too much.

...especially for programmers!

All in all, it's certainly a workable solution for people writing normal text/prose. As a programmer, you're in a completely different realm, for which there are no real solutions. Things might have changed by now, but I'd be surprised if they have.

What's the problem? Most SR software is built to recognize normal language. Programmers write very cryptic stuff, and it's hard, if not impossible, to find software that does the conversion between normal language and code. For example, how would you dictate:

if (somevar == 'a')
{
   print('You pressed a!');
}


Using the commands in your average SR program, this is a huge pain: ""if space left bracket equal sign equal sign apostrophe spell a apostrophe ..."". And I'm not even talking about navigating your code. Ever noticed how much you're using the keyboard while programming, and how different that usage is from how a 'normal' user uses the keyboard?

How to make the best of it

Thus far, I've only worked with Dragon NaturallySpeaking (DNS), so I can only speak for that product. There are some interesting add-ons and websites targeted for people like programmers:


Vocola is an unofficial plugin that allows you to easily add your own commands to DNS. I found it essential, basically. You'll also be able to find command sets written by other programmers, for e.g. navigating code. It's based on a software package written in Python, so there are also some more advanced and fancy packages around. Also check out Vocola's Resources page. (Warning: when I used it, there were some problems with installing Vocola; check out the newsgroup below for info!)
SpeechComputing.com is a forum/newsgroup with lots of interesting discussions. A good place to start.


Closing remarks

It seems that the best solution to this problem is, really:


Find ways around actual coding.
Try to recover. I'm somewhat reluctant to recommend this book, but it seems to work amazingly well for people with RSI/carpal tunnel and other chronic pain issues: J.E. Sarno, Mindbody prescription. I'm working with it right now, and I think it's definitely worth reading.I dictate VB.net and TSQL using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10 Professional. VB.net is inherently closer to a ""spoken"" language, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't work for C# or others. I start with a completely empty vocabulary, and build it from scratch to suit my needs (which is why I use the professional version). 

Here's the basic steps (this assumes you have already created and trained a user):


Create a new vocabulary based on ""Base General - Empty Dictation"".
Don't have it scan your documents or email.
Add lists of keywords with pronunciation specific to your programming language (Dim, ByVal\by-val, etc.).
Create a .txt document that contains all of your code minus comments.
Harvest words from this document and add them with pronunciations.
Use the document to train the vocabulary's language model.


I'll write up something with more detail when I get a chance if anyone is interested.

Edit:

Here's how to dictate SQL code. The word list created here can be included in other vocabularies if you are a database developer.Check out Using Python to Code by Voice.Another idea is to find another good developer to pair program with. It worked really well for me. I get to rest my hands without necessarily slowing down, end up producing better quality code - or at least not having to review as much of it.For all Linux folks, I'd like to share some links.

Related stackoverflow question about text to speech recognition tools for Linux.I know I am little bit off-topic here, and know nothing about voice recognition software; however, you might find it useful to investigate changing your keyboard to the Dvorak layout, which I have heard is a lot kinder on the wrists.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_KeyboardI tried Dragon a couple of years ago and it was a nightmare of mish-mashed words and phrases - not recommended.  I understand that it was the best thing going at that point in time so I'm not optimistic.

As a fellow sufferer, recommendations would be:


Find a job that demands as little OT as possible
Try a variety of keyboards.  In my experience, working on a laptop full-time worked best.
Start a program of low-moderate stress weight lifting.As to the wrist issue, I learned using mouse with both hands some 10 years back.

It's surprisingly easy, and relieves the tension substantially. Currently, I'm using a laptop and pressing the touchpad button is straining my thumb.

Be careful. These problems can last way longer than one would think.



p.s. you might add a tag 'ergonomics' or something - the title can be seen to be about developing for voice recognition.The gold standard for programming by voice is VoiceCode. If I remember correctly, they supports C++ and Python.As mentioned above, Dragon Naturally Speaking is the best speech recognition software out there, however Microsoft Speech Recognition isn't far behind and comes bundled with Vista.

Vocola has recently been ported to MSR, and has a .Net integration feature. 

A few tips


Learning to dictate takes some time. Just because you can speak doesn't mean you know how to use speech recognition software
Getting proficient with a mix of SR and keyboard/mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation.
Use CodeRush or equivalent to type less.I started using my left hand for the mouse, this not only help me a bit, but allowed me to use my right hand more freely, if you write a lot of stuff dwon while you code this helps you a lot.. you can scroll and write down at the same time...

When my problems began i put a water bag under my wrist, i loved it! the bag i had was perfect it was long and i put it before the keyboard so i could rest my wrists there.... until one day i step on it...Dragon Naturally Speaking Preferred and Vocola. Autohotkey to automate as much as possible. Not easy to program though. I tried; almost impossible. Check out John Sarno's Healing Back Pain. It made me better. I'm back to programming all day!Another bit off-topic here, I've found that splitted keboard into two parts and other special keyboards helps, just check-out kinesis. I collected info about such hardware at diigo:

http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm - Kinesis Advantage Contoured Keyboards (Programmable!)
http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/foot.htm some foot switches can be connected to keyboard (for example for window swiching)
http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/freestyle.htm - So far, I've found that even using two normal keyboards is better than one, so I think that splitted freestyle might work as well
http://www.typematrix.com/ - another solution
http://www.maltron.com/ - sometimes when one hand suffers more than other typing with one hand
http://www.keybowl.com/ - this looks interesting as well
I believe there are many other interesting solutions


One more thing! Remember about breaks for exercises. Regular exercises (for example small exercise - every half 
and hour different one) make really really things better !


http://www.workrave.org/ - this will remind you about breaks ;)Scott Hanselman uses voice recognition quite a bit.I used Dragon Dictate in 1996 for the same reason as you.  It was slow going, but better than not working.  I found it easier to write code by filling 4x8 white board with code and then getting someone else to type it in.  Then I used DD to debug.

And while you're at it, you might look at Deborah Quilter's books about RSI.  They're very informative.I can't find a link to one (I did look) but there are keyboards with only 5 keys, allowing you to type with one hand, I assume that you only have one bad wrist.

What are the most useful software development metrics? [closed],"I would like to track metrics that can be used to improve my team’s software development process, improve time estimates, and detect special case variations that need to be addressed during the project execution.

Please limit each answer to a single metric, describe how to use it, and vote up the good answers.(source: osnews.com)ROI. 

The total amount of revenue brought in by the software minus the total amount of costs to produce the software. Breakdown the costs by percentage of total cost and isolate your poorest performing and most expensive area in terms of return-on-investment. Improve, automate, or eliminate that problem area if possible. Conversely, find your highest return-on-investment area and find ways to amplify its effects even further. If 80% of your ROI comes from 20% of your cost or effort, expand that particular area and minimize the rest by comparison.

Costs will include payroll, licenses, legal fees, hardware, office equipment, marketing, production, distribution, and support. This can be done on a macro level for a company as whole or a micro level for a team or individual. It can also be applied to time, tasks, and methods in addition to revenue.

This doesn't mean ignore all the details, but find a way to quantify everything and then concentrate on the areas that yield the best (objective) results.Inverse code coverage

Get a percentage of code not executed during a test. This is similiar to what Shafa mentioned, but the usage is different. If a line of code is ran during testing then we know it might be tested. But if a line of code has not been ran then we know for sure that is has not been tested. Targeting these areas for unit testing will improve quality and takes less time than auditing the code that has been covered. Ideally you can do both, but that never seams to happen.""improve my team’s software development process"": Defect Find and Fix Rates

This relates to the number of defects or bugs raised against the number of fixes which have been committed or verified.

I'd have to say this is one of the really important metrics because it gives you two things:


1. Code churn.  How much code is being changed on a daily/weekly basis (which is important when you are trying to stabilize for a release), and,

2. Shows you whether defects are ahead of fixes or vice-versa.  This shows you how well the development team is responding to defects raised by the QA/testers.

A low fix rate indicates the team is busy working on other things (features perhaps).  If the bug count is high, you might need to get developers to address some of the defects.

A low find rate indicates either your solution is brilliant and almost bug free, or the QA team have been blocked or have another focus.Track how long is takes to do a task that has an estimate against it. If they were well under, question why. If they are well over, question why.

Don't make it a negative thing, it's fine if tasks blow out or were way under estimated. Your goal is to continually improve your estimation process.Track the source and type of bugs that you find.

The bug source represents the phase of development in which the bug was introduced. (eg. specification, design, implementation etc.)

The bug type is the broad style of bug. eg. memory allocation, incorrect conditional.

This should allow you to alter the procedures you follow in that phase of development and to tune your coding style guide to try to eliminate over represented bug types.Velocity: the number of features per given unit time.

Up to you to determine how you define features, but they should be roughly the same order of magnitude otherwise velocity is less useful.  For instance, you may classify your features by stories or use cases.  These should be broken down so that they are all roughly the same size.  Every iteration, figure out how many stories (use-cases) got implemented (completed).  The average number of features/iteration is your velocity.  Once you know your velocity based on your feature unit you can use it to help estimate how long it will take to complete new projects based on their features.

[EDIT] Alternatively, you can assign a weight like function points or story points to each story as a measure of complexity, then add up the points for each completed feature and compute velocity in points/iteration.Track the number of clones (similar code snippets) in the source code.

Get rid of clones by refactoring the code as soon as you spot the clones.Average function length, or possibly a histogram of function lengths to get a better feel.

The longer a function is, the less obvious its correctness.  If the code contains lots of long functions, it's probably a safe bet that there are a few bugs hiding in there.number of failing tests or broken builds per commit.interdependency between classes. how tightly your code is coupled.Track whether a piece of source has undergone review and, if so, what type. And later, track the number of bugs found in reviewed vs. unreviewed code.

This will allow you to determine how effectively your code review process(es) are operating in terms of bugs found.If you're using Scrum, the backlog.  How big is it after each sprint?  Is it shrinking at a consistent rate?  Or is stuff being pushed into the backlog because of (a) stuff that wasn't thought of to begin with (""We need another use case for an audit report that no one thought of, I'll just add it to the backlog."") or (b) not getting stuff done and pushing it into the backlog to meet the date instead of the promised features.http://cccc.sourceforge.net/

It is important to understand that metrics can do nothing to improve your team’s software development process.  All they can be used for is measuring how well you are advancing toward improving your development process in regards to the particular metric you are using.  Perhaps I am quibbling over semantics but the way you are expressing it is why most developers hate it.  It sounds like you are trying to use metrics to drive a result instead of using metrics to measure the result.

To put it another way, would you rather have 100% code coverage and lousy unit tests or fantastic unit tests and < 80% coverage?

Your answer should be the latter.  You could even want the perfect world and have both but you better focus on the unit tests first and let the coverage get there when it does.Every time a bug is reported by the QA team- analyze why that defect escaped unit-testing by the developers.

Consider this as a perpetual-self-improvement exercise.I like Defect Resolution Efficiency metrics. DRE is ratio of defects resolved prior to software release against all defects found. I suggest tracking this metrics for each release of your software into production.Tracking metrics in QA has been a fundamental activity for quite some time now. But often, development teams do not fully look at how relevant these metrics are in relation to all aspects of the business. For example, the typical tracked metrics such as defect ratios, validity, test productivity, code coverage etc. are usually evaluated in terms of the functional aspects of the software, but few pay attention to how they matter to the business aspects of software.

There are also other metrics that can add much value to the business aspects of the software, which is very important when an overall quality view of the software is looked at. These can be broadly classified into:


Needs of the beta users captured by business analysts, marketing and sales folks
End-user requirements defined by the product management team
Ensuring availability of the software at peak loads and ability of the software to integrate with enterprise IT systems
Support for high-volume transactions
Security aspects depending on the industry that the software serves
Availability of must-have and nice-to-have features in comparison to the competition
And a few more….Code coverage percentageIf you're using Scrum, you want to know how each day's Scrum went.  Are people getting done what they said they'd get done?

Personally, I'm bad at it.  I chronically run over on my dailies.Perhaps you can test CodeHealer

CodeHealer performs an in-depth analysis of source code, looking for problems in the following areas:


Audits   Quality control rules such as unused or unreachable code,
use of directive names and
keywords as identifiers, identifiers
hiding others of the same name at a
higher scope, and more.
Checks   Potential errors such as uninitialised or unreferenced
identifiers, dangerous type casting,
automatic type conversions, undefined
function return values, unused
assigned values, and more.
Metrics  Quantification of code properties such as cyclomatic
complexity, coupling between objects
(Data Abstraction Coupling), comment
ratio, number of classes, lines of
code, and more.Size and frequency of source control commits.Most of the aforementioned metrics are interesting but won't help you improve team performance.  Problem is your asking a management question in a development forum.

Here are a few metrics: Estimates/vs/actuals at the project schedule level and personal level (see previous link to Joel's Evidence-based method), % defects removed at release (see my blog: http://redrockresearch.org/?p=58), Scope creep/month, and overall productivity rating (Putnam's productivity index).

"What every digit means in software version (1.7.1.0, for example)?","What could every digit mean in software version? (for example, 1.7.1.0)
How do you numerate your versions? Thank you.It differs from vendor to vendor really. Most commonly, they are (in order):


Major release number
Minor release number
Maintenance release number (bugfixes only)
If used at all: build number (or source control revision number)


1.7.1.0 would this be the first maintenance release to the 1.7 version of the product.

Even defining what the difference between a major and minor release is, is difficult. Major releases normally include significant new features. Or the vendor just wants people to pay for the product again. Minor releases may include fixes and new features, but usually nothing ground breaking.

Some companies use the minor release bit to differentiate between alpha / beta releases and final releases. Odd numbers being pre-releases and even numbers being finals. 1.7 would be a beta of an upcoming 1.8 release. This habit is becoming less and less common though.

Build numbers increment with every release, no matter how minor the changes might be. It is automatically incremented by the build process, every time it runs. Many builds are never see publicly released, but they can help in managing the life cycle of the software, by making it easy for QA to uniquely identify a version of the software.Normally these are <Major.Minor.Revision.Build>.

Where:


Major is a major update to the software
Minor is a small update to the software
Revision is any change made (bug fixes, small updates)
Build number (normally an auto increment if used)


In your example (1.7.1.0):


Major version 1
Had 7 minor updates
First revision/bugfix
No build numberEvery projects chooses its own convention. As others have pointed out, one common convention is ""Major.Minor.Revision.Build""

A couple of my favorites are:

Ubuntu versions are ""Year.Month"". For example, 10.04 was released in April 2010.

TeX versions are theoretically only bux-fixes forevermore, so their versions are asymptotically approaching pi (e.g. 3.1415926)Another method widely used is having an incremental build number. Without any correlation to so called ""version"".

""Version"" is more interesting for consumers wanting to know this is a new product, hence you just give every release a name.

But for internal uses and easy reference of product and his tested\source controlled version, a simple incrementing build number might be more convenient.It depends. Here is information on Microsoft Version Numbers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Version_Number

"What is ""business intelligence"" software? [closed]","Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 9 years ago. Is ""business intelligence"" a buzzword that has no real meaning to software developers, or does the term carry some implied meaning in terms of what the software does or how the software does it (in a general sense)? It appears to be a real business term, but does it mean anything in particular to software that performs business intelligence tasks?BI != Reporting. BI platforms enable users to build applications that help organizations learn and understand their business. Gartner defines a BI platform as a software platform that delivers the following 12 capabilities:


  Integration
  
  
  BI infrastructure — All tools in the platform should use the same
  security, metadata, administration,
  portal integration, object model and
  query engine, and should share the
  same look and feel.
  Metadata management — This is arguably the most important of the 12
  capabilities. Not only should all
  tools leverage the same metadata, but
  the offering should provide a robust
  way to search, capture, store, reuse
  and publish metadata objects such as
  dimensions, hierarchies, measures,
  performance metrics and report layout
  objects.
  Development — The BI platform should provide a set of programmatic
  development tools — coupled with a
  software developer's kit for creating
  BI applications — that can be
  integrated into a business process,
  and/or embedded in another
  application. The BI platform should
  also enable developers to build BI
  applications without coding by using
  wizard-like components for a graphical
  assembly process. The development
  environment should also support Web
  services in performing common tasks
  such as scheduling, delivering,
  administering and managing.
  Workflow and collaboration — This capability enables BI users to
  share and discuss information via
  public folders and discussion threads.
  In addition, the BI application can
  assign and track events or tasks
  allotted to specific users, based on
  pre-defined business rules. Often,
  this capability is delivered by
  integrating with a separate portal or
  workflow tool.
  
  
  Information Delivery
  
  
  Reporting — Reporting provides the ability to create formatted and
  interactive reports with highly
  scalable distribution and scheduling
  capabilities. In addition, BI platform
  vendors should handle a wide array of
  reporting styles (for example,
  financial, operational and performance
  dashboards).
  Dashboards — This subset of reporting includes the ability to
  publish formal, Web-based reports with
  intuitive displays of information,
  including dials, gauges and traffic
  lights. These displays indicate the
  state of the performance metric,
  compared with a goal or target value.
  Increasingly, dashboards are used to
  disseminate real-time data from
  operational applications.
  Ad hoc query — This capability, also known as self-service
  reporting, enables users to ask their
  own questions of the data, without
  relying on IT to create a report. In
  particular, the tools must have a
  robust semantic layer to allow users
  to navigate available data sources. In
  addition, these tools should offer
  query governance and auditing
  capabilities to ensure that queries
  perform well.
  Microsoft Office integration — In some cases, BI platforms are used
  as a middle tier to manage, secure and
  execute BI tasks, but Microsoft Office
  (particularly Excel) acts as the BI
  client. In these cases, it is vital
  that the BI vendor provides
  integration with Microsoft Office,
  including support for document
  formats, formulas, data ""refresh"" and
  pivot tables. Advanced integration
  includes cell locking and write-back.
  
  
  Analysis
  
  
  OLAP — This enables end users to analyze data with extremely fast
  query and calculation performance,
  enabling a style of analysis known as
  ""slicing and dicing."" This capability
  could span a variety of storage
  architectures such as relational,
  multidimensional and in-memory.
  Advanced visualization — This provides the ability to display
  numerous aspects of the data more
  efficiently by using interactive
  pictures and charts, instead of rows
  and columns. Over time, advanced
  visualization will go beyond just
  slicing and dicing data to include
  more process-driven BI projects,
  allowing all stakeholders to better
  understand the workflow through a
  visual representation.
  Predictive modeling and data mining — This capability enables
  organizations to classify categorical
  variables and estimate continuous
  variables using advanced mathematical
  techniques.
  Scorecards — These take the metrics displayed in a dashboard a
  step further by applying them to a
  strategy map that aligns key
  performance indicators to a strategic
  objective. Scorecard metrics should be
  linked to related reports and
  information in order to do further
  analysis. A scorecard implies the use
  of a performance management
  methodology such as Six Sigma or a
  balanced scorecard framework.Definition

Business intelligence (BI) refers to skills, technologies, applications and practices used to help a business acquire a better understanding of its commercial context. Business intelligence may also refer to the collected information itself.

BI technologies provide historical, current, and predictive views of business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies are reporting, OLAP, analytics, data mining, business performance management, benchmarks, text mining, and predictive analytics.

Business intelligence often aims to support better business decision-making. Thus a BI system can be called a decision support system (DSS).

Personal experience

After having worked for 7 years in a BI software product in the past, I don't think it's an empty buzzword. Go to a supermarket business and ask them how they know how much cheese they put in their store; where they put it; and which brands. Go to a sausage producer: they had our product analyze sells based on lots of variables, for example, which kind of display they got in the supermarket: ordinary, more relevant, hard to spot.  They decided which variables were relevant to them and thus should be analyzed. Go to a package sending company and ask them which services they promote and why. They all analyze all their data and they use software for that. Of course you need a brain as well as software; but, alas, you need software as well as a brain.

It may be a wide, open term, yes. But it's not an empty term.

In more practical terms, anything which pays your bills for 7 years is not empty :-)You can write a piece of ""business intelligence"" software - but it's fairly complex. Such software would act like a manager of sorts, by analyzing data and making recommendations. Think about an program with an MBA. The catch is, to actually write a program like that requires not only building analysis tools to let the application automatically scan through information looking for business patterns, but also to give the program ""intuition"" which most successful business managers have. A program that runs based on strict rules will not necessarily make the best decisions, just the best documented decisions.

I was contacted by a company (this is an example of practical applications for business intelligence) that wanted an application to monitor trends in certain market categories, and use those trends to predict optimal prices for their products. They were selling luxury products whose prices fluctuated throughout the year and according to various economic indicators. Most of their managers could do this kind of price setting, and they were looking to automate it. The analysis required to do this would involve advanced statistics, some artificial intelligence to interpret it, not to mention the ability to acquire the data it needed on its own. The project's opening budget was $2M. Not something for the light-hearted.Business Intelligence is about denormalizing your existing OLTP databases into a system of measurement criteria. One of the most important requistes of Business Intelligence systems is that the data that is reported on is outputted with a great deal of speed. The transactional OLTP database systems would choke on queries that an OLAP (database type used for BI reporting) database routinely performs with a great deal of speed. When I speak of speed, in my experience any query that takes greater than 5 seconds indicates a need to refactor the architecture in better ways. In the transactional environment, the database language used is TSQL. In the OLAP world the unified language is known as MDX, Multi-Dimensional eXtensions and actually is an extension to the SQL language. In the Microsoft stack and as of VS 2005, Analysis Services as well as MS SQL Server are at home with the CLR. Applications can be created and maintained directly from within Visual Studio's IDE. The ability to hook into SSIS objects from within VS and create ETL processing layers that can integrate with SQL Server and have the scrubbed Data Warehouse whose source becomes the DataSource for your Analysis Services database certainly indicates to me that a developer gains a ton of control over inputs and outputs when creating solutions with the MS Stack. In any event that is my take.

Based upon experience Business Objects, Oracle and to a lesser degree Cognos were forced into acquisition to enhance their BI offerings with Business Objects being more of a Reporting consumer than a database and reporting consumer company. Cognos in my opinion made the more intelligent acquisition when the acquired an additional planning OLAP database from Applix named TM1 and along with it got one of the best Self service OLAP reporting tools in the business named Executive Viewer which can report against Oracle's Essbase, TM1, Cognos likely by now, Analysis Services, SAP BW, To my knowledge HP has no BI offering. They were using Executive Viewer however when I last looked.In practical terms its the buzzword which describes a set of products such as Business Objects, SAS BI, and some offerings from the usual suspects such as Oracle and HP.

Mostly these are ""pretty print"" report writing front ends to datawarehouse style databases, and, probably the best generic description would be the presentation layer in a data warehouse architecture.Business Intelligence (BI) represents the tools and systems that play a key role in the strategic planning process of the corporation. These systems allow a company to gather, store, access and analyze corporate data to aid in decision-making. Generally these systems will illustrate business intelligence in the areas of customer profiling, customer support, market research
, market segmentation, product profitability, statistical analysis, and inventory and distribution analysis to name a few.Giving a much longer answer seems to make it sound full of wind, so:

Business Intelligence: reporting software with strong additional abilities focused on future prediction based on historical data.A new generation BI has become much more interactive oriented. With flash and other web 2.0, sophisticated yet easy-to-use dashboards, visualization are delivered on web like reports before.Business Intelligence is about understanding one's business. It's an odd converse of Military Intelligence which is about understanding the enemy. It provide suits with information with which to make business decisions.

"What is ""over-engineering"" as applied to software? [closed]","Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 9 years ago. I wonder what would be a good definition of term ""over-engineering"" as applied to software development. The expression seems to be used a lot during software design discussions often in conjunction with ""excessive future-proofing"" and it would be nice to nail down a more precise definition.Contrary to most answers, I do not believe that ""presently unneeded functionality"" is over-engineering; or it is the least problematic form.

Like you said, the worst kind of over-engineering is usually committed in the name of future-proofing and extensibility - and achieves the exact opposite:


Empty layers of abstraction that are at best unnecessary and at worst restrict you to a narrow, inefficient use of the underlying API.
Code littered with designated ""extension points"" such as protected methods or components acquired via abstract factories - which all turn out to be not quite what you actually need when you do have to extend the functionality.
Making everything configurable to ""avoid hard-coding"", with the effect that there's more (complex, failure-prone) application logic in configuration files than in source code.
Over-genericizing: instead of implementing the (technically uninteresting) functional spec, the developer builds a (technically interesting) ""business rule engine"" that ""executes"" the specs themselves as supplied by business users. The net result is an interpreter for a proprietary (scripting or domain-specific) language that is usually horribly designed, has no tool support and is so hard to use that no business user could ever work with it.


The truth is that the design that is most easily adapted to new and changing requirements (and is thus the most future-proof and extensible) is the design that is as simple as possible.Contrary to popular belief, over-engineering is really a phenomena that appears when engineers get ""hubris"" and think they understand the user.

I made a simple diagram to illustrate this:In the cases where we've considered things over engineered, it's always been describing software that has been designed to be so generic that it loses sight of the main task that it was initially designed to perform, and has therefore become not only hard to use, but fundimentally unintelligent.To me, over-engineering is including anything that you don't need and that you don't know you're going to need.  If you catch yourself saying that a feature might be nice if the requirements change in a certain way, then you might be over-engineering.  Basically, over-engineering is violating YAGNI.The agile answer to this question is: every piece of code that does not contribute to the requested functionality.There is this discussion at Joel on Software that starts with,


  creating extensive class hierarchies for an imagined future problem that does not yet exist, is a kind of over-engineering, and is therefore, bad. 


And, gets into a discussion with examples.If you spend so much time thinking about the possible ramifications of a problem that you end up interfering with the solving of the problem itself, you may be over-engineering.

There's a fine balance between ""best engineering practices"" and ""real world applicability"". At some point you have to decide that even though a particular solution may not be as ""pure"" from an engineering standpoint as it could be, it will do the job.

For example:

If you are designing a user management system for one-time use at a high school reunion, you probably don't need to add support for incredibly long names, or funky character sets. Setting a reasonable maximum length and doing some basic sanitizing should be sufficient. On the other hand, if you're creating a system that will be deployed for hundreds of similar events, you might want to spend some more time on the problem.

It's all about the appropriate level of effort for the task at hand.I'm afraid that a precise definition is probably not possible as it's highly dependent on the context.  For example, it's much easier to over-engineer a web site that displays glittering ponies than it is a nuclear power plant control system.  Redundancies, excessive error checking, highly instrumented logging facilities are all over-engineering for a glittering ponies app, but not for a nuclear power plant control system.  I think the best you can do is have a feeling about when you are applying too much overhead to your features for the purpose of the application.

Note that I would distinguish between gold-plating and over-engineering.  In my mind, gold-plating is creating features that weren't asked for and will never be used.  Over-engineering is more about how much ""safety"" you build into the application either by coding checks around the code or using excessive design for a simple task.This relates to my controversial programming opinion of ""The simplest approach is always the best approach"".Quoting from here: ""...Implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.""To me it is anything that would add any more fat to the code. Meat would be any code that will do the job according to the spec and fat would be any code that would bloat the code in a way that it just adds more complexity. The programmer might have been expecting a future expansion of the functionality; but still it is fat.!My rough definition would be 'Providing functionality that isnt needed to meet the requirements spec'I think they are the same as Gold plating and being hit by the Golden hammer :)

Basically, you can sit down and spent too much time trying to make a perfect design, without ever writing some code to check out how it works. Any agile method will tell you not to do all your design up-front, and to just create chunks of design, implement it, reiterate over it, re-design, go again, etc...Over-engeneering means architecting and designing the applcation with more components than it really should have according to the requirements list.

There is a big difference between over-engeneering and creating an extensible applcaiton, that can be upgraded as reqirements change. If I can think of an example i'll edit the post.Over-engineering is simply creating a product with greater functionality, quality, generality, extensibility, documentation, or any other aspect than is required.

Of course, you may have requirements outside a specific project -- for example, if you forsee doing future similar applications, then you might have additional requirements for extendability, dependent on cost, that you add on to the project specific requirements.When your design actually makes things more complex instead of simplifying things, you’re overengineering.


More on this at:

http://www.codesimplicity.com/post/what-is-overengineering/Disclaimer #1: I am a big-picture BA. I know no code. I read this site all the time. This is my first post.

Funny I was just told by my boss that I over-engineered a new software produce we're planning for mentoring (target market HR people).  So I came here to look up the term.

They want to get something in place to sell now, re-purposing existing tools. I can't help but sit back and think, fewer signups, lower retention, if it doesn't allow some of the flexibility we talked about.  And mainly, have a highly visual UI that a monkey could use.

He said we could plan future phases to improve the product, especially the UI.  We have current customers waiting on ""future improvements"" that we still aren't doing. They need it though, truly need it.

What is Data URI support like in major email client software?,"Data URIs are a standard way to embed images and other binary data in HTML, and browser support is well documented on the web. (IE8 was the first version of IE to support Data URI, with a max 32 KB size per URI; other major browsers have supported it even longer.) My question is about desktop email and webmail client software. When building HTML email, standard practice is either to include images as attachments or load them externally (i.e. tracking images). Both of these have disadvantages (some clients list all of these attached files, while many rightly block or require user action to see external images). So, Data URI looks like a good way to go, but only if it's supported by email readers. So, does anyone have a link to a recent study of support for this feature? Or investigated this at all? For example, here's an overview of CSS support. Client software I'd be interested includes: Desktop (including version info): Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird, Evolution, Lotus Notes, AOL, Eudora Webmail: Gmail, Live/Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, AOL Mobile: Android, iPhoneI've done a more recent test at Litmus, with data URIs for inline <img> elements and css background images.

Lotus Notes 8
Outlook 2003
Thunderbird 3.0
Thunderbird latest

These mobile clients don't:


Gmail (Android)
Outlook.com (Android)
Yahoo (Android)
BlackBerry 4 OS
Symbian
Windows Phone 7.5I just tested GMail, and it appears that GMail no longer supports data URIs.

In addition, gmx.de (a very popular German web mail provider) converts image URIs to a URI on its server, and this doesn't seem to support data URIs.Mac Mail, Outlook 2003 and MobileMe support data URIs. Not sure about the other clients, but you can easily find out — create a new message in Gmail, click 'insert image', then click 'use a URL' and paste in the data URI. Then, send it to a number of addresses and open it in the clients you want.I can't answer the question about the support for data-uri directly but support for anything like this is often very bad in email browsers. The issue really spans from many of them using their own cut down rendering engines that aren't full html renderers. In a system that it's still preferable to use a table based design to make sure emails are readable I wouldn't try to do anything clever.

However, you may already know that email allows two types of attachment. If you mark an attachment as inline then it tends not to show up in the list of attachments (though it often does).

I would think personally that ensuring the readability of the email is better than it not showing up and obviously the other approach of remote images doesn't help here.",,,,,1,528,69.97,22.21,18.88,65.01,25.14,21.59,75,51.7,41.1,7.77,2.27,0.95,0,0.76,0,0.57,5.49,11.74,5.3,5.3,11.36,6.06,4.36,5.87,2.27,12.5,5.11,3.03,1.52,0.19,0.76,0.57,11.55,0.76,10.8,1.89,0.95,1.52,3.22,0.57,4.36,0,3.6,3.22,0.38,0.57,0.19,0.38,0,0,0.19,0,9.47,5.87,2.08,0,0,0.19,3.41,3.41,0,0,0,0,6.63,0,0.19,6.44,3.79,0,0.19,3.6,0,0,0.57,0.38,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0.19,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0.38,3.22,9.09,0.76,0.57,4.73,3.03,0,0,2.27,0.95,4.55,0.57,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,20.27,5.68,5.3,0.38,0.19,3.03,5.68,
What is Software Escrow? Is Software Escrow something you want? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 5 years ago. What is Software Escrow? Is Software Escrow something you want?This is where, when a customer purchases the software or a service, a vendor will put their codebase into the control of a third-party with contractual terms that it can be released to the customer should the vendor cease trading.

As a customer buying in a closed-source product from a small vendor where their longevity is unclear it can be a make-or-break on a deal providing some assurance of continuity should they cease trading.Software escrow is when you nominate a 3rd party company to take possession of your source code. They keep your code safe and don't release it to anyone. 

In the event that your company ever goes bankrupt, or closes down, the escrow provider will release your source code to any clients who were using your application (who also usually will an account with the escrow provider).

You will find that if you provide software to large institutions (like Banks, etc) they are likely to demand escrow agreements so they can ensure that if in the future something goes terribly wrong in your company, they aren't left with an app that can't be supported.

Usually the escrow provider will perform some form of validation on your source code to confirm that the code you have provided is enough to produce a fully compiled and working copy of your application. Often this validation takes the form of a demonstration of the full build process from the provided media.

The cases under which the escrow provider can release your code will vary slightly from  provider to provider and your specific contract with them, but will usually only be for outright company closures. They don't usually just give out your source code just because you've decided not to fix a particular bug in your next release.

With regards to whether or not escrow is something you want, it depends on which side of the fence you're on. If you are development company selling software, then only do it if you client requires it. Escrow providers charge a fee, and it can be time consuming to ensure that the escrow is kept regularly up to date (particularly if you don't have full clean build scripts).

If you are buying software, consider what would happen if the company you are buying from went bankrupt. Is the software you are buying so critical that you wouldn't just be able to switch for something new? Also, are you big enough, that you could realistically take on the cost of getting your own (or new) developers to maintain the application.softwareescrowguide.com is but a google away. The short version - software escrow is where a third party has a copy of a software product's source code, guaranteeing that, say, a business using that software product can continue development of the product if the vendor goes under.

Is it something you want? Depends on who you are and what you want, I guess.It's something the purchaser definitely wants. Is it something the developer wants? Probably, in that it will help make the deal. The catch is to write the contract so that you retain control as long as it makes sense for you to retain control.Software Escrow generally refers to a provision in Software licensing agreements that allow the party the licenses the software to acquire the source code in certain circumstances, typically bankruptcy (or something similar) of the party that wrote the software.  Often times a neutral third party will ""hold"" the code in escrow and be the arbiter of whether they should give the code to the licensee.  

They tend to be used when small companies license software to big companies since big companies want to protect themselves incase of bankruptcy of a small company.  In practice, these things cost money and time.  A neutral third party will charge money for the service and the team the wrote the software will need to update the escrow account periodically.

As to whether you want it -

If you are a software vendor, then not unless the client asks and only then if you have to.  It is a pain to manage.

If you are licensing the software, you probably don't care unless you are a large company with a lot of resources. In practice, if you need to maintaining someone else's code it not  particularly practicalFrom a user's perspective: If the user does not have access to an application's source code, software escrow is the insurance policy that in the event of a ""disaster"" the escrow agent will release a copy of the source code to the user.  The user needs to determine the risk associated with not being able to get the business critical or mission critical software maintained as their business needs change.

From a developer's perspective: There are two perspectives.
1) It is a tool to ensure their intellectual property (the source code) is kept in-house unless a ""disaster"" occurs when the escrow agent will release a copy of the source code to the user.  2) It can also be used as a tool to help marketing their application.  

""Disasters"" or release events are explicitly defined in the escrow agreement. 

Software Escrow Guardians is an escrow agent and has been providing software escrow services for nearly twenty years.  The company has an escrow agreement template suitable as a framework for an escrow service involving an individual user and a developer.

What is a software framework? [closed],"Can someone please explain me what a software framework is? Why do we need a framework? What does a framework do to make programming easier?I'm very late to answer it. But, I would like to share one example, which I only thought of today. If I told you to cut a piece of paper with dimensions 5m by 5m, then surely you would do that. But suppose I ask you to cut 1000 pieces of paper of the same dimensions. In this case, you won't do the measuring 1000 times; obviously, you would make a frame of 5m by 5m, and then with the help of it you would be able to cut 1000 pieces of paper in less time. So, what you did was make a framework which would do a specific type of task. Instead of performing the same type of task again and again for the same type of applications, you create a framework having all those facilities together in one nice packet, hence providing the abstraction for your application and more importantly many applications.Technically, you don't need a framework. If you're making a really really simple site (think of the web back in 1992), you can just do it all with hard-coded HTML and some CSS.

And if you want to make a modern webapp, you don't actually need to use a framework for that, either.

You can instead choose to write all of the logic you need yourself, every time. 
You can write your own data-persistence/storage layer, or - if you're too busy - just write custom SQL for every single database access. 
You can write your own authentication and session handling layers. 
And your own template rending logic. 
And your own exception-handling logic. 
And your own security functions. 
And your own unit test framework to make sure it all works fine. 
And your own... [goes on for quite a long time]

Then again, if you do use a framework, you'll be able to benefit from the good, usually peer-reviewed and very well tested work of dozens if not hundreds of other developers, who may well be better than you. You'll get to build what you want rapidly, without having to spend time building or worrying too much about the infrastructure items listed above.

You can get more done in less time, and know that the framework code you're using or extending is very likely to be done better than you doing it all yourself.

And the cost of this? Investing some time learning the framework. But - as virtually every web dev out there will attest - it's definitely worth the time spent learning to get massive (really, massive) benefits from using whatever framework you choose.The summary at Wikipedia (Software Framework) (first google hit btw) explains it quite well:


  A software framework, in computer programming, is an abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing specific functionality. Frameworks are a special case of software libraries in that they are reusable abstractions of code wrapped in a well-defined Application programming interface (API), yet they contain some key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries.
  
  Software frameworks have these distinguishing features that separate them from libraries or normal user applications:
  
  
  inversion of control - In a framework, unlike in libraries or normal user applications, the overall program's flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.[1]
  default behavior - A framework has a default behavior. This default behavior must actually be some useful behavior and not a series of no-ops.
  extensibility - A framework can be extended by the user usually by selective overriding or specialized by user code providing specific functionality.
  non-modifiable framework code - The framework code, in general, is not allowed to be modified. Users can extend the framework, but not modify its code.
  


You may ""need"" it because it may provide you with a great shortcut when developing applications, since it contains lots of already written and tested functionality. The reason is quite similar to the reason we use software libraries.A lot of good answers already, but let me see if I can give you another viewpoint.

Simplifying things by quite a bit, you can view a framework as an application that is complete except for the actual functionality.  You plug in the functionality and PRESTO! you have an application.

Consider, say, a GUI framework.  The framework contains everything you need to make an application.  Indeed you can often trivially make a minimal application with very few lines of source that does absolutely nothing -- but it does give you window management, sub-window management, menus, button bars, etc.  That's the framework side of things.  By adding your application functionality and ""plugging it in"" to the right places in the framework you turn this empty app that does nothing more than window management, etc. into a real, full-blown application.

There are similar types of frameworks for web apps, for server-side apps, etc.  In each case the framework provides the bulk of the tedious, repetitive code (hopefully) while you provide the actual problem domain functionality.  (This is the ideal.  In reality, of course, the success of the framework is highly variable.)

I stress again that this is the simplified view of what a framework is.  I'm not using scary terms like ""Inversion of Control"" and the like although most frameworks have such scary concepts built-in.  Since you're a beginner, I thought I'd spare you the jargon and go with an easy simile.I'm not sure there's a clear-cut definition of ""framework"". Sometimes a large set of libraries is called a framework, but I think the typical use of the word is closer to the definition aioobe brought.

This very nice article sums up the difference between just a set of libraries and a framework:


  A framework can be defined as a set of libraries that say “Don’t call us, we’ll call you.”


How does a framework help you? Because instead of writing something from scratch, you basically just extend a given, working application. You get a lot of productivity this way - sometimes the resulting application can be far more elaborate than you could have done on your own in the same time frame - but you usually trade in a lot of flexibility.A simple explanation is: A framework is a scaffold that you can you build applications around.

A framework generally provides some base functionality which you can use and extend to make more complex applications from, there are frameworks for all sorts of things. Microsofts MVC framework is a good example of this. It provides everything you need to get off the ground building website using the MVC pattern, it handles web requests, routes and the like. All you have to do is implement ""Controllers"" and provide ""Views"" which are two constructs defined by the MVC framework. The MVC framework then handles calling your controllers and rendering your views.

Perhaps not the best wording but I hope it helpsat the lowest level, a framework is an environment, where you are given a set of tools to work with

this tools come in the form of libraries, configuration files, etc.

this so-called ""environment"" provides you with the basic setup (error reportings, log files, language settings, etc)...which can be modified,extended and built upon.

People actually do not need frameworks, it's just a matter of wanting to save time, and others just a matter of personal preferences.

People will justify that with a framework, you don't have to code from scratch. But those are just people confusing libraries with frameworks.

I'm not being biased here, I am actually using a framework right now.In General, A frame Work is real or Conceptual structure of intended to serve as a support or Guide for the building some thing that expands the structure into something useful...A framework provides functionalities/solution to the particular problem area.

Definition from wiki:


  A software framework, in computer
  programming, is an abstraction in
  which common code providing generic
  functionality can be selectively
  overridden or specialized by user code
  providing specific functionality.
  Frameworks are a special case of
  software libraries in that they are
  reusable abstractions of code wrapped
  in a well-defined Application
  programming interface (API), yet they
  contain some key distinguishing
  features that separate them from
  normal libraries.A framework helps us about using the ""already created"", a metaphore can be like, 

think that earth material is the programming language, 

and for example ""a camera"" is the program, and you decided to create a notebook. You don't need to recreate the camera everytime, you just use the earth framework (for example to a technology store) take the camera and integrate it to your notebook.A framework has some functions that you may need. you maybe need some sort of arrays that have inbuilt sorting mechanisms. Or maybe you need a window where you want to place some controls, all that you can find in a framework. it's a kind of WORK that spans a FRAME around your own work.

EDIT:
OK I m about to dig what you guys were trying to tell me ;) you perhaps havent noticed the information between the lines ""WORK that spans a FRAME around ...""
before this is getting fallen deeper n deeper. I try to give a floor to it hoping you're gracfully:

a good explanation to the question ""Difference between a Library and a Framework"" I found here

http://ifacethoughts.net/2007/06/04/difference-between-a-library-and-a-framework/Beyond definitions, which are sometimes understandable only if you already understand, an example helped me.

I think I got a glimmer of understanding when loooking at sorting a list in .Net; an example of a framework providing a functionality that's tailored by user code providing specific functionality.   Take List.Sort(IComparer).  The sort algorithm, which resides in the .Net framework in the Sort method, needs to do a series of compares; does object A come before or after object B?  But Sort itself has no clue how to do the compare; only the type being sorted knows that.  You couldn't write a comparison sort algorithm that can be reused by many users and anticipate all the various types you'd be called upon to sort.  You've got to leave that bit of work up to the user itself.  So here, sort, aka the framework, calls back to a method in the user code, the type being sorted so it can do the compare.  (Or a delegate can be used; same point.)

What is opinionated software?,"I often see people saying that certain software is ""very opinionated"" or that Microsoft tends to write ""un-opinionated"" frameworks. What does this actually mean?If a framework is opinionated, it lock or guides you into their way of doing things.

For example: some people believe that a template system shouldn't provide access to user defined methods and functions as it leaves the system open to returning raw HTML. So an opinionated framework developer only allows access to data structures. By design, the software is limiting and encourages the designer into doing things their way.

Another example (taken from the signals link) is that of wiki. The designers of wiki had a lot of opinions. They thought HTML was too complicated for people to write, so they came up with what they felt was a more natural way to update content. They also stripped it of fancy design because they felt the focus ought to be more on content than design.

Apple has strong opinions when it designs its products.

Un-opinionated software design is more like PERL/PHP. It allows the developer and trusts the developer to make the right decisions and puts more control in their hands. 

I would also place Microsoft in the non-opinionated column. A good example of a Microsoft framework which is un-opininated: .NET. By opening the CLR and the specs, it opened it to all sorts of languages and styles of implementations.Opinionated software means that there is basically one way (the right way™) to do things and trying to do it differently will be difficult and frustrating.  On the other hand, doing things the right way™ can make it very easy to develop with the software as the number of decisions that you have to make is reduced and the ability of the software designers to concentrate on making the software work is increased.  Opinionated software can be great to use, if done well, if your problem maps onto the solution nicely.  It can be a real pain to solve those parts of your problem that don't map onto the tools provided.  An example here would be Ruby on Rails.

Non-opinionated software, on the other hand, leaves lots of flexibility to the user (developer).  It doesn't proscribe one method of solving a problem, but provides flexible tools that can be used to solve the problem in many ways.   The downside of this can be that because the tools are so flexible, it may be relatively hard to develop any solution.  Much more of the solution may have to be hand-coded by the user (developer) because the framework doesn't provide enough help.  You also have to think much more about how to provide a solution and mediocre developers may end up with poorer solutions than if they had bought into some opinionated software.  PERL is probably the classic example of non-opinionated software.

My ideal is a non-opinionated framework, but one with strong conventions.  I would put ASP.NET MVC in this category.  In reality all software is opinionated to some extent (though perhaps not PERL).  MVC has strong conventions in its choice of model but offers many different ways to solve problems within those conventions.  Some of those ways may even break the model.  Used correctly, however, in accordance with the conventions developing in such a framework can be a real joy.It's basically software that works the way its authors think it should work, instead of trying to please everybody. That means a lot of people will not like it, but the ones that do will love it.

Rails is probably the canonical example of an opinionated framework: you do things their way, and everything is smooth. If you don't, you're in for some pain. But that's OK -- if you don't want to do things their way, you don't want to use Rails.For balance's sake I will provide a (rather opinionated) description that is more favourable to the opinionated approach (in contrast to some of the other answers).

Opinionated frameworks provide a ""golden path"", which is supposed to be the best practice for most people and most scenarios (in the eyes of the authors).

This however doesn't necessarily mean lock-in. It means that it may require some extra effort to do things differently.

Less opinionated frameworks provide a number of different options and leave it up to you to decide.

Opinionated frameworks usually remove the burden from developer to reinvent the wheel or rethink the same problem again and again and thus help focus on the real problem at hand.

In the open-source world you can find many opinionated yet competing frameworks, so you still have a choice. You just have to choose your own golden path.Opinionated software is built and designed in such a way that it makes it easy to do things in a certain way. It favors certain design patterns more than others. In the process it makes it difficult to deviate from the style of software development for which it was developed. Another way of putting it is that it favors ""Convention over configuration"". i.e. The configuration options are very limited as the software assumes many of the configuration aspects. Opinionated software usually is quicker to master once the assumptions are understood.

Unopinionated software on the other hand makes few assumptions. And as a result, softwares/software development frameworks that are unopinionated often tend to have a lot of configuration options. A developer typically has to make a lot of decisions regarding various aspects of the software. Often, various tools are developed so as to make dealing with these enormous options easier. e.g. Visual Studio .NET for .NET, Eclipse IDE for Java etc. Unopinionated software typically takes longer to master than opinionated software.tl;dr:


Opinionated: e.g. Ruby on Rails. There is one particularly preferred way to do things, and you get a lot of support in doing things that way. Doing things other ways is hard, or for some systems impossible (Cassandra comes to mind).
Un-opinionated: e.g. Perl 5. You can do anything you like, any way you like, in any style. All styles are equally open, valid and supported.A lot of people are referencing ASP.NET MVC as an ""unopinionated"" framework, and I just wanted to weigh in with a couple of thoughts on that.

It's true that ASP.NET MVC doesn't mandate too much; you can use whatever persistence solution you like, be it Linq-to-SQL, ADO.NET Entities, NHibernate, etc.

On the flip side, the MVC framework does tend to favour ""convention over configuration"", to quote Phil Haack, which heavily suggests following the pre-defined pattern for locating controllers, views, models and other code. Although you can alter this behaviour, it's easier to swim with the current, and for most people, there's no problem doing that.

Also surrounding ASP.NET MVC are a lot of opinionated people, which I find leads to a lot of biased tutorials which insist upon covering, e.g. unit testing and dependency injection; I'm all for good testing and separation of concerns, but I do perceive that such topics are shoved down one's throat a little, often ahead of covering more useful basics.

There again, I do have to concede that within those areas, the framework itself is completely open to adopting whatever unit testing solution you want, as well as whatever dependency injection and mocking frameworks you want to use, so I guess that provides another example of flexibility, even within the ""bible bashing"" of unit testing, etc. that seems to be going on.It's the amount of conventions implemented in a framwork and the number of decision that have been taken.

If, for instance, there are 5 (or more) different ways to submit form data to a controller action (which is the case in ASP.NET MVC), the framework seems to be pretty ""un-opinionated"" - the decision is up to you!

If, however, the framework enables (either through directly disabling other ways, or by strongly encouraging it) only one way of doing that thing (which is the case with Fubu MVC), you could say that the decision has been taken by the framework, thus making the framework opinionated.The example you will see a lot at the moment is the ASP.NET MVC framework. It is amazingly extensible but that is its downfall in some respects, there isn't any meat to it. Want to do data access? You'll have to write that yourself. Want some AJAX going on? Ditto. 

However, as it is highly extensible, if you build upon it you can turn it into an opinionated framework. This is what the likes of MVCContrib do, they give you specific methods of doing things which means you have to write less code.

This does mean that if you want to break from the opinion there is often more work to do than if you were working on the vanilla version. This is an 80/20 scenario though. If you chose your opinionated framework correctly you will only want to break from the opinions 20% of the time and you'll be highly productive the other 80% of the time.",,,,,1,1516,64.09,34.06,32.17,17.91,19.95,22.96,83.38,67.08,57.12,12.14,4.09,0.73,0,2.57,0,0.79,8.05,16.62,7.78,0.79,14.38,10.16,4.95,5.8,0.92,16.69,5.87,6.13,3.1,0.33,1.78,1.12,17.15,0.46,16.62,3.89,1.85,2.24,3.56,0.4,5.41,0,4.16,1.98,2.18,0.46,0.26,0.2,0,0.07,0,0,7.85,4.42,0.73,0.13,0.07,1.52,0.73,3.43,0,0,0,0,1.78,0.07,0,1.72,1.39,0,0,1.25,0.07,0.07,0.79,0.2,0.13,0.07,0,0,0,0.13,0,1.12,0.59,0.4,0,0.13,0,0,0.13,0.26,4.02,7.65,0.2,0.99,5.41,0.46,0,0.53,1.39,1.65,6.73,2.24,0.13,0.07,0.07,0,0,17.41,6.66,4.22,0.2,0.07,1.45,4.82,
What is sustaining software engineering? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 10 years ago. I've come across the phrase 'sustaining software engineering' but don't know exactly what it means. There seems to be some DoD connection?

Managing a software project in order to maximize the positive and minimize the negative social and environmental effects of the project.

Alternative (Sustaining): Consideration of the long-term support requirements during the design and development of a software project.  The process of conducting the long-term support required when development is complete.It's just a fancy way of saying ""Software Maintenance Team"".Sustaining Software Engineering, at least in the cases where I've come across it, is the department responsible for implementing hot-fixes for released products, and handling customer service issues that the tech-support guys can't resolve on their own.Many in the software world define sustaining engineering as the bug fix team. While this is a part of the duties involved the sustaining engineering group should also be looking at the overall defect trends to help identify areas needing re-factoring. The focus of the group should be to not just fix bugs as they come in but to be the conduit back into engineering to ELIMINATE needless calls from customers.

What is the difference between a port and a socket?,"This was a question raised by one of the software engineers in my organisation.  I'm interested in the broadest definition.A socket consists of three things:


An IP address
A transport protocol
A port number


A port is a number between 1 and 65535 inclusive that signifies a logical gate in a device.
Every connection between a client and server requires a unique socket.

For example:


1030 is a port.
(10.1.1.2 , TCP , port 1030) is a socket.A socket represents a single connection between two network applications. These two applications nominally run on different computers, but sockets can also be used for interprocess communication on a single computer. Applications can create multiple sockets for communicating with each other. Sockets are bidirectional, meaning that either side of the connection is capable of both sending and receiving data.
Therefore a socket can be created theoretically at any level of the OSI model from 2 upwards. Programmers often use sockets in network programming, albeit indirectly. Programming libraries like Winsock hide many of the low-level details of socket programming. Sockets have been in widespread use since the early 1980s.

A port represents an endpoint or ""channel"" for network communications. Port numbers allow different applications on the same computer to utilize network resources without interfering with each other. Port numbers most commonly appear in network programming, particularly socket programming. Sometimes, though, port numbers are made visible to the casual user. For example, some Web sites a person visits on the Internet use a URL like the following:

http://www.mairie-metz.fr:8080/ In this example, the number 8080 refers to the port number used by the Web browser to connect to the Web server. Normally, a Web site uses port number 80 and this number need not be included with the URL (although it can be).

In IP networking, port numbers can theoretically range from 0 to 65535. Most popular network applications, though, use port numbers at the low end of the range (such as 80 for HTTP).

Note: The term port also refers to several other aspects of network technology. A port can refer to a physical connection point for peripheral devices such as serial, parallel, and USB ports. The term port also refers to certain Ethernet connection points, such as those on a hub, switch, or router.

ref http://compnetworking.about.com/od/basicnetworkingconcepts/l/bldef_port.htm

ref http://compnetworking.about.com/od/itinformationtechnology/l/bldef_socket.htmWith some analogy

Although a lot technical stuff is already given above for sockets...
I would like to add my answer, just in case , if somebody still could not feel the difference between ip, port and sockets

Consider a server S,

and say person X,Y,Z need a service (say chat service) from that server S

then 

IP address tells --> who? is that chat server 'S' that X,Y,Z  want to contact

okay, you got ""who is the server""

but suppose that server 'S' is providing some other services to other people as well,say 'S' provides storage services to person A,B,C

then

port tells ---> which? service you (X,Y,Z) need i.e. chat service and not that storage service

okay.., you make server to come to know that 'chat service' is what you want and not the storage

but 

you are three and the server might want to identify all the three differently

there comes the socket

now socket tells--> which one? particular connection

that is , say ,

socket 1 for person X

socket 2 for person Y

and socket 3 for person Z

I hope it helps someone who was still confused 
:)A socket = IP Address + a port (numeric address)

Together they identify an end-point for a network connection on a machine. (Did I just flunk network 101?)Generally, you will get a lot of theoretical but one of the easiest ways to differentiate these two concepts is as follows:
In order to get a service, you need a service number. This service number is called a port. Simple as that.
For example, the HTTP as a service is running on port 80.
Now, many people can request the service, and a connection from client-server gets established. There will be a lot of connections. Each connection represents a client. In order to maintain each connection, the server creates a socket per connection to maintain its client.These are basic networking concepts so I will explain them in an easy yet a comprehensive way to understand in details.


A socket is like a telephone (i.e. end to end device for communication)
IP is like your telephone number (i.e. address for your socket)
Port is like the person you want to talk to (i.e. the service you want to order from that address)
A socket can be a client or a server socket (i.e. in a company the telephone of the customer support is a server but a telephone in your home is mostly a client)


So a socket in networking is a virtual communication device bound to a pair (ip , port) = (address , service). 


Note: 



A machine, a computer, a host, a mobile, or a PC can have multiple addresses , multiple open ports, and thus multiple sockets. Like in an office you can have multiple telephones with multiple telephone numbers and multiple people to talk to. 
Existence of an open/active port necessitate that you must have a socket bound to it, because it is the socket that makes the port accessible. However, you may have unused ports for the time being.
Also note, in a server socket you can bind it to (a port, a specific address of a machine) or to (a port, all addresses of a machine) as in the telephone you may  connect many telephone lines (telephone numbers) to a telephone or one specific telephone line to a telephone and still you can reach a person through all these telephone lines or through a specific telephone line.
You can not associate (bind) a socket with two ports as in the telephone usually you can not always have two people using the same telephone at the same time .
Advanced: on the same machine you cannot have two sockets with same type (client, or server) and same port and ip. However, if you are a client you can open two connections, with two sockets, to a server because the local port in each of these client's sockets  is different)


Hope it clears you doubtsThere seems to be a lot of answers equating socket with the connection between 2 PC's..which I think is absolutely incorrect. A socket has always been the endpoint on 1 PC, that may or may not be connected - surely we've all used listener or UDP sockets* at some point. The important part is that it's addressable and active. Sending a message to 1.1.1.1:1234 is not likely to work, as there is no socket defined for that endpoint.

Sockets are protocol specific - so the implementation of uniqueness that both TCP/IP and UDP/IP uses* (ipaddress:port), is different than eg., IPX (Network, Node, and...ahem, socket - but a different socket than is meant by the general ""socket"" term. IPX socket numbers are equivalent to IP ports). But, they all offer a unique addressable endpoint.

Since IP has become the dominant protocol, a port (in networking terms) has become synonomous with either a UDP or TCP port number - which is a portion of the socket address.


UDP is connection-less - meaning no virtual circuit between the 2 endpoints is ever created. However, we still refer to UDP sockets as the endpoint. The API functions make it clear that both are just different type of sockets - SOCK_DGRAM is UDP (just sending a message) and SOCK_STREAM is TCP (creating a virtual circuit).
Technically, the IP header  holds the IP Address, and the protocol on top of IP (UDP or TCP) holds the port number. This makes it possible to have other protocols (eg. ICMP that have no port numbers, but do have IP addressing information).Short brief answer.

A port can be described as an internal address within a host that identifies a program or process.

A socket can be described as a programming interface allowing a program to communicate with other programs or processes, on the internet, or locally.They are terms from two different domains: 'port' is a concept from TCP/IP networking, 'socket' is an API (programming) thing. A 'socket' is made (in code) by taking a port and a hostname or network adapter and combining them into a data structure that you can use to send or receive data.After reading the excellent up-voted answers, I found that the following point needed emphasis for me, a newcomer to network programming:

TCP-IP connections are bi-directional pathways connecting one address:port combination with another address:port combination. Therefore, whenever you open a connection from your local machine to a port on a remote server (say www.google.com:80), you are also associating a new port number on your machine with the connection, to allow the server to send things back to you, (e.g. 127.0.0.1:65234).  It can be helpful to use netstat to look at your machine's connections:

> netstat -nWp tcp (on OS X)
Active Internet connections
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)    
tcp4       0      0  192.168.0.6.49871      17.172.232.57.5223     ESTABLISHED
...A socket is a communication endpoint. A socket is not directly related to the TCP/IP protocol family, it can be used with any protocol your system supports. The C socket API expects you to first get a blank socket object from the system that you can then either bind to a local socket address (to directly retrieve incoming traffic for connection-less protocols or to accept incoming connection requests for connection-oriented protocols) or that you can connect to a remote socket address (for either kind of protocol). You can even do both if you want to control both, the local socket address a socket is bound to and the remote socket address a socket is connected to. For connection-less protocols connecting a socket is even optional but if you don't do that, you'll have to also pass the destination address with every packet you want to send over the socket as how else would the socket know where to send this data to? Advantage is that you can use a single socket to send packets to different socket addresses. Once you have your socket configured and maybe even connected, consider it to be a bi-directional communication pipe. You can use it to pass data to some destination and some destination can use it to pass data back to you. What you write to a socket is send out and what has been received is available for reading.
Ports on the other hand are something that only certain protocols of the TCP/IP protocol stack have. TCP and UDP packets have ports. A port is just a simple number. The combination of source port and destination port identify a communication channel between two hosts. E.g. you may have a server that shall be both, a simple HTTP server and a simple FTP server. If now a packet arrives for the address of that server, how would it know if that is a packet for the HTTP or the FTP server? Well, it will know so as the HTTP server will run on port 80 and the FTP server on port 21, so if the packet arrives with a destination port 80, it is for the HTTP server and not for the FTP server. Also the packet has a source port since without such a source port, a server could only have one connection to one IP address at a time. The source port makes it possible for a server to distinguish otherwise identical connections: they all have the same destination port, e.g. port 80, the same destination IP (the IP of the server), and the same source IP, as they all come from the same client, but as they have different source ports, the server can distinguish them from each other. And when the server sends back replies, it will do so to the port the request came from, that way the client can also distinguish different replies it receives from the same server.A socket is a special type of file handle which is used by a process to request network services from the operating system.
A socket address is the triple:
{protocol, local-address, local-process} where the local process is identified by a port number.

In the TCP/IP suite, for example:

{tcp, 193.44.234.3, 12345}

A conversation is the communication link between two processes thus depicting an association between two.
An association is the 5-tuple that completely specifies the two processes that comprise a connection:
{protocol, local-address, local-process, foreign-address, foreign-process}

In the TCP/IP suite, for example:

{tcp, 193.44.234.3, 1500, 193.44.234.5, 21}

could be a valid association.

A half-association is either:
{protocol, local-address, local-process}

or

{protocol, foreign-address, foreign-process}

which specify each half of a connection.

The half-association is also called a socket or a transport address. That is, a socket is an end point for communication that can be named and addressed in a network.
The socket interface is one of several application programming interfaces (APIs) to the communication protocols. Designed to be a generic communication programming interface, it was first introduced by the 4.2BSD UNIX system. Although it has not been standardized, it has become a de facto industry standard.A socket address is an IP address & port number
123.132.213.231         # IP address
               :1234    # port number
123.132.213.231:1234    # socket address

A connection occurs when 2 sockets are bound together.An application consists of pair of processes which communicate over the network (client-server pair). These processes send and receive messages, into and from the network through a software interface called socket. Considering the analogy presented in the book ""Computer Networking: Top Down Approach"". There is a house that wants to communicate with other house. Here, house is analogous to a process, and door to a socket. Sending process assumes that there is a infrastructure on the other side of the door that will transport the data to the destination. Once the message is arrived on the other side, it passes through receiver's door (socket) into the house (process). This illustration from the same book can help you:



Sockets are part of transport layer, which provides logical communication to applications. This means that from application's point of view both hosts are directly connected to each other, even though there are numerous routers and/or switches between them. Thus a socket is not a connection itself, it's the end point of the connection. Transport layer protocols are implemented only on hosts, and not on intermediate routers.

Ports provide means of internal addressing to a machine. The primary purpose it to allow multiple processes to send and receive data over the network without interfering with other processes (their data). All sockets are provided with a port number. When a segment arrives to a host, the transport layer examines the destination port number of the segment. It then forwards the segment to the corresponding socket. This job of delivering the data in a transport layer segment to the correct socket is called de-multiplexing. The segment's data is then forwarded to the process attached to the socket.The port was the easiest part, it is just a unique identifier for a socket. A socket is something processes can use to establish connections and to communicate with each other. Tall Jeff had a great telephone analogy which was not perfect, so I decided to fix it:


ip and port ~ phone number
socket ~ phone device
connection ~ phone call
establishing connection ~ calling a number
processes, remote applications ~ people
messages ~ speechA socket is a structure in your software.  It's more-or-less a file; it has operations like read and write.  It isn't a physical thing; it's a way for your software to refer to physical things.

A port is a device-like thing.  Each host has one or more networks (those are physical); a host has an address on each network.  Each address can have thousands of ports. 

One socket only may be using a port at an address.  The socket allocates the port approximately like allocating a device for file system I/O.  Once the port is allocated, no other socket can connect to that port.  The port will be freed when the socket is closed.

Take a look at TCP/IP Terminology.from Oracle Java Tutorial:


  A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.Port and socket can be compared to the Bank Branch.
  


The building number of the ""Bank"" is analogous to IP address.
A bank has got different sections like:


Savings account department
Personal loan department
Home loan department
Grievance department


So 1 (savings account department), 2 (personal loan department), 3 (home loan department) and 4 (grievance department) are ports.

Now let us say you go to open a savings account, you go to the bank (IP address), then you go to ""savings account department"" (port number 1), then you meet one of the employees working under ""savings account department"". Let us call him SAVINGACCOUNT_EMPLOYEE1 for opening account.

SAVINGACCOUNT_EMPLOYEE1 is your socket descriptor, so there may be 
SAVINGACCOUNT_EMPLOYEE1 to SAVINGACCOUNT_EMPLOYEEN. These are all socket descriptors.

Likewise, other departments will be having employess working under them and they are analogous to socket.A socket is a data I/O mechanism. A port is a contractual concept of a communication protocol. A socket can exist without a port. A port can exist witout a specific socket (e.g. if several sockets are active on the same port, which may be allowed for some protocols).

A port is used to determine which socket the receiver should route the packet to, with many protocols, but it is not always required and the receiving socket selection can be done by other means - a port is entirely a tool used by the protocol handler in the network subsystem. e.g. if a protocol does not use a port, packets can go to all listening sockets or any socket.Port:

A port can refer to a physical connection point 
for peripheral devices such as serial, parallel, and USB ports.
 The term port also refers to certain Ethernet connection points, s
uch as those on a hub, switch, or router. 

Socket:

A socket represents a single connection between two network applications.
 These two applications nominally run on different computers,
 but sockets can also be used for interprocess communication on a single computer. 
Applications can create multiple sockets for communicating with each other.
 Sockets are bidirectional, meaning that either side of the connection is capable of both sending and receiving data.Relative TCP/IP terminology which is what I assume is implied by the question. In layman's terms:

A PORT is like the telephone number of a particular house in a particular zip code. The ZIP code of the town could be thought of as the IP address of the town and all the houses in that town.

A SOCKET on the other hand is more like an established phone call between telephones of a pair of houses talking to each other. Those calls can be established between houses in the same town or two houses in different towns. It's that temporary established pathway between the pair of phones talking to each other that is the SOCKET.In a broad sense,
Socket - is just that, a socket, just like your electrical, cable or telephone socket. A point where ""requisite stuff"" (power, signal, information) can go out and come in from. It hides a lot of detailed stuff, which is not required for the use of the ""requisite stuff"". In software parlance, it provides a generic way of defining a mechanism of communication between two entities (those entities could be anything - two applications, two physically separate devices, User & Kernel space within an OS, etc)

A Port is an endpoint discriminator. It differentiates one endpoint from another. At networking level, it differentiates one application from another, so that the networking stack can pass on information to the appropriate application.Socket is an abstraction provided by kernel to user applications for data I/O. A socket type is defined by the protocol it's handling, an IPC communication etc. So if somebody creates a TCP socket he can do manipulations like reading data to socket and writing data to it by simple methods and the lower level protocol handling like TCP conversions and forwarding packets to lower level network protocols is done by the particular socket implementation in the kernel. The advantage is that user need not worry about handling protocol specific nitigrities and should just read and write data to socket like a normal buffer. Same is true in case of IPC, user just reads and writes data to socket and kernel handles all lower level details based on the type of socket created.
Port together with IP is like providing an address to the socket, though its not necessary, but it helps in network communications.A port denotes a communication endpoint in the TCP and UDP transports for the IP network protocol. A socket is a software abstraction for a communication endpoint commonly used in implementations of these protocols (socket API). An alternative implementation is the XTI/TLI API.

Port is just a property of a socket you have specify if you want to establish a communication. To receieve packet from a socket you have to bind it to specific local port and NIC (with local IP address) or all NICs (INADDR_ANY is specified in the bind call). To send packet, you have to specify port and IP of the remote socket.Already theoretical answers have been given to this question. I would like to give a practical example to this question, which will clear your understanding about Socket and Port.

  This example will walk you thru the process of connecting to a website, such as Wiley. You would open your web browser (like Mozilla Firefox) and type www.wiley.com into the address bar. Your web browser uses a Domain Name System (DNS) server to look up the name www.wiley.com to identify its IP address is. For this example, the address is 192.0.2.100.
  
  Firefox makes a connection to the 192.0.2.100 address and to the port
  where the application layer web server is operating. Firefox knows
  what port to expect because it is a well-known port . The well-known
  port for a web server is TCP port 80.
  
  The destination socket that Firefox attempts to connect is written as
  socket:port, or in this example, 192.0.2.100:80. This is the server
  side of the connect, but the server needs to know where to send the
  web page you want to view in Mozilla Firefox, so you have a socket for
  the client side of the connection also.
  
  The client side connection is made up of your IP address, such as
  192.168.1.25, and a randomly chosen dynamic port number. The socket associated with Firefox looks like 192.168.1.25:49175. Because web
  servers operate on TCP port 80, both of these sockets are TCP sockets,
  whereas if you were connecting to a server operating on a UDP port,
  both the server and client sockets would be UDP sockets.A single port can have one or more sockets connected with different external IP's like a multiple electrical outlet.

Also, a (non-normative) definition in the Java Tutorial.Firsty, I think we should start with a little understanding of what constitutes getting a packet from A to B.

A common definition for a network is the use of the OSI Model which separates a network out into a number of layers according to purpose. There are a few important ones, which we'll cover here:


The data link layer. This layer is responsible for getting packets of data from one network device to another and is just above the layer that actually does the transmitting. It talks about MAC addresses and knows how to find hosts based on their MAC (hardware) address, but nothing more.
The network layer is the layer that allows you to transport data across machines and over physical boundaries, such as physical devices. The network layer must essentially support an additional address based mechanism which relates somehow to the physical address; enter the Internet Protocol (IPv4). An IP address can get your packet from A to B over the internet, but knows nothing about how to traverse individual hops. This is handled by the layer above in accordance with routing information.
The transport layer. This layer is responsible for defining the way information gets from A to B and any restrictions, checks or errors on that behaviour. For example, TCP adds additional information to a packet such that it is possible to deduce if packets have been lost.


TCP contains, amongst other things, the concept of ports. These are effectively different data endpoints on the same IP address to which an Internet Socket (AF_INET) can bind. 

As it happens, so too does UDP, and other transport layer protocols. They don't technically need to feature ports, but these ports do provide a way for multiple applications in the layers above to use the same computer to receive (and indeed make) outgoing connections.

Which brings us to the anatomy of a TCP or UDP connection. Each features a source port and address, and a target port and address. This is so that in any given session, the target application can respond, as well as receive, from the source.

So ports are essentially a specification-mandated way of allowing multiple concurrent connections sharing the same address.

Now, we need to take a look at how you communicate from an application point of view to the outside world. To do this, you need to kindly ask your operating system and since most OSes support the Berkeley Sockets way of doing things, we see we can create sockets involving ports from an application like this:

int fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); // tcp socket
int fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0); // udp socket
// later we bind...


Great! So in the sockaddr structures, we'll specify our port and bam! Job done! Well, almost, except:

int fd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);


is also possible. Urgh, that's thrown a spanner in the works!

Ok, well actually it hasn't. All we need to do is come up with some appropriate definitions:


An internet socket is the combination of an IP address, a protocol and its associated port number on which a service may provide data. So tcp port 80, stackoverflow.com is an internet socket. 
An unix socket is an IPC endpoint represented in the file system, e.g. /var/run/database.sock.
A socket API is a method of requesting an application be able to read and write data to a socket.


Voila! That tidies things up. So in our scheme then, 


A port is a numeric identifier which, as part of a transport layer protocol, identifies the service number which should respond to the given request.


So really a port is a subset of the requirements for forming an internet socket. Unfortunately, it just so happens that the meaning of the word socket has been applied to several different ideas. So I heartily advise you name your next project socket, just to add to the confusion ;)",,,,,1,4783,89.4,37.42,18.87,25.35,22.25,23.86,76.54,59.48,48.88,6.98,2.72,0.4,0.31,1.59,0.04,0.31,4.27,17.58,11.27,3.89,12.63,7.63,3.43,5.31,0.63,13.28,4.98,4.14,1.59,0.65,0.44,0.54,12.88,0.5,12.38,2.03,1.65,2.03,2.2,0.23,4.64,0,1.23,0.75,0.36,0.4,0.19,0.21,0.02,0,0.08,0.13,8.09,3.35,0.23,0.13,0.06,0,2.32,3.43,0,0,0,0.23,2.26,0,0,2.26,3.55,0.02,0.25,3.01,0.5,0,0.27,0.02,0,0,0,0.04,0,0,0.04,0.5,0.25,0.59,0.04,0,0,0.04,0.23,0.36,3.12,7.51,0.15,0.75,6.5,0.36,0.06,0.04,1,1.48,6.36,0.79,0.42,0.33,0.08,0,0,20.78,7.63,4.87,0.13,0.1,0.79,7.25,
What is the difference between a process and a thread?,"What is the technical difference between a process and a thread? I get the feeling a word like 'process' is overused and there are also hardware and software threads. How about light-weight processes in languages like Erlang? Is there a definitive reason to use one term over the other?Both processes and threads are independent sequences of execution. The typical difference is that threads (of the same process) run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.

I'm not sure what ""hardware"" vs ""software"" threads you might be referring to. Threads are an operating environment feature, rather than a CPU feature (though the CPU typically has operations that make threads efficient).

Erlang uses the term ""process"" because it does not expose a shared-memory multiprogramming model. Calling them ""threads"" would imply that they have shared memory.Process

Each process provides the resources needed to execute a program. A process has a virtual address space, executable code, open handles to system objects, a security context, a unique process identifier, environment variables, a priority class, minimum and maximum working set sizes, and at least one thread of execution. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the primary thread, but can create additional threads from any of its threads.

Thread

A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. All threads of a process share its virtual address space and system resources. In addition, each thread maintains exception handlers, a scheduling priority, thread local storage, a unique thread identifier, and a set of structures the system will use to save the thread context until it is scheduled. The thread context includes the thread's set of machine registers, the kernel stack, a thread environment block, and a user stack in the address space of the thread's process. Threads can also have their own security context, which can be used for impersonating clients.



This information was found on Microsoft Docs here: About Processes and Threads     


  Microsoft Windows supports preemptive multitasking, which creates the effect of simultaneous execution of multiple threads from multiple processes. On a multiprocessor computer, the system can simultaneously execute as many threads as there are processors on the computer.Process:


An executing instance of a program is called a process.
Some operating systems use the term ‘task‘ to refer to  a program that is being executed.
A process is always stored in the main memory also termed as the primary memory or random access memory.
Therefore, a process is termed as an active entity. It disappears if the machine is rebooted.
Several process may be associated with a same program.
On a multiprocessor system, multiple processes can be executed in parallel.
On a uni-processor system, though true parallelism is not achieved, a process scheduling algorithm is applied and the processor is scheduled to execute each process one at a time yielding  an illusion of concurrency.
Example: Executing multiple instances of the ‘Calculator’ program. Each of the instances are termed as a process.


Thread:


A thread is a subset of the process.
It is termed as a ‘lightweight process’, since it is similar to a real process but executes within the context of a process and shares the same resources allotted to the process by the kernel.
Usually, a process has only one thread of control – one set of machine instructions executing at a time.
A process may also be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.
Multiple threads of control can exploit the true parallelism possible on multiprocessor systems.
On a uni-processor system, a thread scheduling algorithm is applied and the processor is scheduled to run each thread one at a time.
All the threads running within a process share the same address space, file descriptors, stack and other process related attributes.
Since the threads of a process share the same memory, synchronizing the access to the shared data within the process gains unprecedented importance.


I borrowed the above info from the Knowledge Quest! blog.First, let's look at the theoretical aspect.  You need to understand what a process is conceptually to understand the difference between a process and a thread and what's shared between them.
We have the following in section 2.2.2 The Classical Thread Model of Modern Operating Systems 3e by Tanenbaum:

The process model is based on two independent concepts: resource
grouping and execution. Sometimes it is use­ful to separate them;
this is where threads come in....

He continues:

One way of looking at a process is that it is a way to
group related resources together. A process has an address space
containing program text and data, as well as other resources. These
resource may include open files, child processes, pending alarms,
signal handlers, accounting information, and more. By putting them
together in the form of a process, they can be managed more easily.
The other concept a process has is a thread of execution, usually
shortened to just thread. The thread has a program counter that keeps
track of which instruc­tion to execute next. It has registers, which
hold its current working variables. It has a stack, which contains the
execution history, with one frame for each proce­dure called but not
yet returned from. Although a thread must execute in some process, the
thread and its process are different concepts and can be treated
sepa­rately. Processes are used to group resources together; threads
are the entities scheduled for execution on the CPU.

Further down he provides the following table:
Per process items             | Per thread items
------------------------------|-----------------
Address space                 | Program counter
Global variables              | Registers
Open files                    | Stack
Child processes               | State
Pending alarms                |
Signals and signal handlers   |
Accounting information        |

Let's deal with the hardware multithreading issue.  Classically, a CPU would support a single thread of execution, maintaining the thread's state via a single program counter (PC), and set of registers.  But what happens when there's a cache miss?  It takes a long time to fetch data from main memory, and while that's happening the CPU is just sitting there idle.  So someone had the idea to basically have two sets of thread state (PC + registers) so that another thread (maybe in the same process, maybe in a different process) can get work done while the other thread is waiting on main memory.  There are multiple names and implementations of this concept, such as Hyper-threading and simultaneous multithreading (SMT for short).
Now let's look at the software side.  There are basically three ways that threads can be implemented on the software side.

User space threads
Kernel threads
A combination of the two

All you need to implement threads is the ability to save the CPU state and maintain multiple stacks, which can in many cases be done in user space.  The advantage of user space threads is super fast thread switching since you don't have to trap into the kernel and the ability to schedule your threads the way you like.  The biggest drawback is the inability to do blocking I/O (which would block the entire process and all its user threads),  which is one of the big reasons we use threads in the first place.  Blocking I/O using threads greatly simplifies program design in many cases.
Kernel threads have the advantage of being able to use blocking I/O, in addition to leaving all the scheduling issues to the OS.  But each thread switch requires trapping into the kernel which is potentially relatively slow.  However, if you're switching threads because of blocked I/O this isn't really an issue since the I/O operation probably trapped you into the kernel already anyway.
Another approach is to combine the two, with multiple kernel threads each having multiple user threads.
So getting back to your question of terminology, you can see that a process and a thread of execution are two different concepts and your choice of which term to use depends on what you're talking about.  Regarding the term ""light weight process"", I don't personally see the point in it since it doesn't really convey what's going on as well as the term ""thread of execution"".To explain more with respect to concurrent programming

A process has a self-contained execution environment. A process generally has a complete, private set of basic run-time resources; in particular, each process has its own memory space.

Threads exist within a process — every process has at least one. Threads share the process's resources, including memory and open files. This makes for efficient, but potentially problematic, communication.


An example keeping the average person in mind:
On your computer, open Microsoft Word and a web browser. We call these two processes.
In Microsoft Word, you type something and it gets automatically saved. Now, you have observed editing and saving happens in parallel - editing on one thread and saving on the other thread.An application consists of one or more processes. A process, in the simplest terms, is an executing program. One or more threads run in the context of the process. A thread is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the process code, including parts currently being executed by another thread. A fiber is a unit of execution that must be manually scheduled by the application. Fibers run in the context of the threads that schedule them.


Stolen from here.A process is a collection of code, memory, data and other resources. A thread is a sequence of code that is executed within the scope of the process. You can (usually) have multiple threads executing concurrently within the same process.Real world example for Process and Thread
This will give you the basic idea about thread and process


I borrowed the above info from Scott Langham's Answer - thanksEvery process is a thread (primary thread).
But every thread is not a process. It is a part(entity) of a process.Both threads and processes are atomic units of OS resource allocation (i.e. there is a concurrency model describing how CPU time is divided between them, and the model of owning other OS resources). There is a difference in:


Shared resources (threads are sharing memory by definition, they do not own anything except stack and local variables; processes could also share memory, but there is a separate mechanism for that, maintained by OS)
Allocation space (kernel space for processes vs. user space for threads)


Greg Hewgill above was correct about the Erlang meaning of the word ""process"", and here there's a discussion of why Erlang could do processes lightweight.Trying to answer this question relating to Java world.

A process is an execution of a program but a thread is a single execution sequence within the process. A process can contain multiple threads. A thread is sometimes called a lightweight process.

For example:

Example 1:
A JVM runs in a single process and threads in a JVM share the heap belonging to that process. That is why several threads may access the same object. Threads share the heap and have their own stack space. This is how one thread’s invocation of a method and its local variables are kept thread safe from other threads. But the heap is not thread-safe and must be synchronized for thread safety.

Example 2:
A program might not be able to draw pictures by reading keystrokes. The program must give its full attention to the keyboard input and lacking the ability to handle more than one event at a time will lead to trouble. The ideal solution to this problem is the seamless execution of two or more sections of a program at the same time. Threads allows us to do this. Here Drawing picture is a process and reading keystroke is sub process (thread).http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9608/0191.html

  NO!
  
  There is NO reason to think that ""threads"" and ""processes"" are
  separate entities. That's how it's traditionally done, but I
  personally think it's a major mistake to think that way. The only
  reason to think that way is historical baggage. 
  
  Both threads and processes are really just one thing: a ""context of
  execution"". Trying to artificially distinguish different cases is just
  self-limiting. 
  
  A ""context of execution"", hereby called COE, is just the conglomerate
  of  all the state of that COE. That state includes things like CPU
  state  (registers etc), MMU state (page mappings), permission state
  (uid, gid)  and various ""communication states"" (open files, signal
  handlers etc). Traditionally, the difference between a ""thread"" and a
  ""process"" has been mainly that a threads has CPU state (+ possibly
  some other minimal state), while all the other context comes from the
  process. However, that's just
  one way of dividing up the total state of the COE, and there is nothing that says that it's the right way to do it. Limiting yourself
  to that kind of image is just plain stupid. 
  
  The way Linux thinks about this (and the way I want things to work) is
  that there is no such thing as a ""process"" or a ""thread"". There is
  only the totality of the COE (called ""task"" by Linux). Different COE's
  can share parts of their context with each other, and one subset of
  that sharing is the traditional ""thread""/""process"" setup, but that
  should really be seen as ONLY a subset (it's an important subset, but
  that importance comes not from design, but from standards: we obviusly
  want to run standards-conforming threads programs on top of Linux
  too). 
  
  In short: do NOT design around the thread/process way of thinking. The
  kernel should be designed around the COE way of thinking, and then the
  pthreads library can export the limited pthreads interface to users
  who  want to use that way of looking at COE's.
  
  Just as an example of what becomes possible when you think COE as
  opposed  to thread/process:
  
  
  You can do a external ""cd"" program, something that is traditionally impossible in UNIX and/or process/thread (silly example, but the idea 
  is that you can have these kinds of ""modules"" that aren't limited to 
  the traditional UNIX/threads setup). Do a:
  
  
  clone(CLONE_VM|CLONE_FS);
  
  child: execve(""external-cd"");
  
  /* the ""execve()"" will disassociate the VM, so the only reason we 
  used CLONE_VM was to make the act of cloning faster */
  
  
  You can do ""vfork()"" naturally (it meeds minimal kernel support, but  that support fits the CUA way of thinking perfectly):
  
  
  clone(CLONE_VM);
  
  child: continue to run, eventually execve()
  
  mother: wait for execve
  
  
  you can do external ""IO deamons"":
  
  
  clone(CLONE_FILES);
  
  child: open file descriptors etc
  
  mother: use the fd's the child opened and vv.
  
  All of the above work because you aren't tied to the thread/process
  way of thinking. Think of a web server for example, where the CGI
  scripts are done as ""threads of execution"". You can't do that with
  traditional threads, because traditional threads always have to share
  the whole address space, so you'd have to link in everything you ever
  wanted to do in the web server itself (a ""thread"" can't run another
  executable). 
  
  Thinking of this as a ""context of execution"" problem instead, your
  tasks can now chose to execute external programs (= separate the
  address space from the parent) etc if they want to, or they can for
  example share everything with the parent except for the file
  descriptors (so that the sub-""threads"" can open lots of files without
  the parent needing to worry about them: they close automatically when
  the sub-""thread"" exits, and it doesn't use up fd's in the parent). 
  
  Think of a threaded ""inetd"", for example. You want low overhead
  fork+exec, so with the Linux way you can instead of using a ""fork()""
  you write a multi-threaded inetd where each thread is created with
  just CLONE_VM (share address space, but don't share file descriptors
  etc). Then the child can execve if it was a external service (rlogind,
  for example), or maybe it was one of the internal inetd services
  (echo, timeofday) in which case it just does it's thing and exits. 
  
  You can't do that with ""thread""/""process"".
  
  LinusFor those who are more comfortable with learning by visualizing, here is a handy diagram I created to explain Process and Threads.

I used the information from MSDN - About Processes and ThreadsTrying to answer it from Linux Kernel's OS View

A program becomes a process when launched into memory. A process has its own address space meaning having various segments in memory such as .text segement for storing compiled code, .bss for storing uninitialized static or global variables, etc. 
Each process would have its own program counter and user-space stack. 

Inside kernel, each process would have its own kernel stack (which is separated from user space stack for security issues) and a structure named task_struct which is generally abstracted as the process control block, storing all the information regarding the process such as its priority, state,(and a whole lot of other chunk). 
A process can have multiple threads of execution.

Coming to threads, they reside inside a process and share the address space of the parent process along with other resources which can be passed during thread creation such as filesystem resources, sharing pending signals, sharing data(variables and instructions) therefore making threads lightweight and hence allowing faster context switching. 

Inside kernel, each thread has its own kernel stack along with the task_struct structure which defines the thread. Therefore kernel views threads of same process as different entities and are schedulable in themselves. Threads in same process share a common id called as thread group id(tgid), also they have a unique id called as the process id (pid).Both processes and threads are independent sequences of execution. The typical difference is that threads (of the same process) run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.            

Process

Is a program in execution. it has text section i.e the program code, current activity as represented by the value of program counter & content of processors register. It also includes the process stack that contains temporary data(such as function parameters, return addressed and local variables), and a data section, which contains global variables. A process may also include a heap, which is memory that is dynamically allocated during process run time.

Thread

A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilisation; it comprises a thread ID, a program counter, register set, and a stack. it shared with other threads belonging to the same process its code section, data section and other operating system resources such as open files and signals.

-- Taken from Operating System by GalvinProcess:

Process is basically a program in execution. It is an active entity.
Some operating systems use the term ‘task‘ to refer to a program that is being executed.
A process is always stored in the main memory also termed as the primary memory or random access memory.
Therefore, a process is termed as an active entity. It disappears if the machine is rebooted.
Several process may be associated with a same program.
On a multiprocessor system, multiple processes can be executed in parallel.
On a uni-processor system, though true parallelism is not achieved, a process scheduling algorithm is applied and the processor is scheduled to execute each process one at a time yielding an illusion of concurrency.
Example: Executing multiple instances of the ‘Calculator’ program. Each of the instances are termed as a process.

ref-https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/difference-between-process-and-threadDifference between Thread and Process?

A process is an executing instance of an application and A thread is a path of execution within a process. Also, a process can contain multiple threads.It’s important to note that a thread can do anything a process can do. But since a process can consist of multiple threads, a thread could be considered a ‘lightweight’ process. Thus, the essential difference between a thread and a process is the work that each one is used to accomplish. Threads are used for small tasks, whereas processes are used for more ‘heavyweight’ tasks – basically the execution of applications.

Another difference between a thread and a process is that threads within the same process share the same address space, whereas different processes do not. This allows threads to read from and write to the same data structures and variables, and also facilitates communication between threads. Communication between processes – also known as IPC, or inter-process communication – is quite difficult and resource-intensive.


  Here’s a summary of the differences between threads and processes:



Threads are easier to create than processes since they 
don't require a separate address space.
Multithreading requires careful programming since threads 
share data strucures that should only be modified by one thread
at a time.  Unlike threads, processes don't share the same 
address space.
Threads are considered lightweight because they use far 
less resources than processes.
Processes are independent of each other.  Threads, since they 
share the same address space are interdependent, so caution 
must be taken so that different threads don't step on each other.

This is really another way of stating #2 above.
A process can consist of multiple threads.A thread runs in a shared memory space, but a process runs in a separate memory space
A thread is a light-weight process, but a process is a heavy-weight process.
A thread is a subtype of process.From the point of view of an interviewer, there are basically just 3 main things that I want to hear, besides obvious things like a process can have multiple threads:


Threads share same memory space, which means a thread can access memory from other's thread memory. Processes normally can not.
Resources. Resources (memory, handles, sockets, etc) are release at process termination, not thread termination.
Security. A process has a fixed security token. A thread, on the other hand, can impersonate different users/tokens.


If you want more, Scott Langham's response pretty much covers everything.
All these are from the perspective of an operating system. Different languages can implement different concepts, like tasks, light-wigh threads and so on, but they are just ways of using threads (of fibers on Windows).
There are no hardware and software threads. There are hardware and software exceptions and interrupts, or user-mode and kernel threads.The following is what I got from one of the articles on The Code Project. I guess it explains everything needed clearly.


  A thread is another mechanism for splitting the workload into separate
  execution streams. A thread is lighter weight than a process. This
  means, it offers less flexibility than a full blown process, but can
  be initiated faster because there is less for the Operating System to
  set up. When a program consists of two or more threads, all the
  threads share a single memory space. Processes are given separate address spaces.
  all the threads share a single heap. But each thread is given its own stack.Coming from the embedded world, I would like to add that the concept of processes only exists in ""big"" processors (desktop CPUs, ARM Cortex A-9) that have MMU (memory management unit) , and operating systems that support using MMUs (such as Linux). With small/old processors and microcontrollers and small RTOS operating system (real time operating system), such as freeRTOS, there is no MMU support and thus no processes but only threads.

Threads can access each others memory, and they are scheduled by OS in an interleaved manner so they appear to run in parallel (or with multi-core they really run in parallel).

Processes, on the other hand, live in their private sandbox of virtual memory, provided and guarded by MMU. This is handy because it enables: 


keeping buggy process from crashing the entire system.
Maintaining security by making other processes data invisible and
unreachable. 
The actual work inside the process is taken care by one or more threads.I've perused almost all answers there, alas, as an undergraduate student taking OS course currently I can't comprehend thoroughly the two concepts. I mean most of guys read from some OS books the differences i.e. threads are able to access to global variables in the transaction unit since they make use of their process' address space. Yet, the newly question arises why there are processes, cognizantly we know already threads are more lightweight vis-à-vis processes. Let's glance at the following example by making use of the image excerpted from one of the prior answers, 

We have 3 threads working at once on a word document e.g. Libre Office. The first does spellchecking by underlining if the word is misspelt. The second takes and prints letters from keyboard. And the last does save document in every short times not to lose the document worked at if something goes wrong. In this case, the 3 threads cannot be 3 processes since they share a common memory which is the address space of their process and thus all have access to the document being edited. So, the road is the word document along with two bulldozers which are the threads though one of them is lack in the image.Basically, a thread is a part of a process without process thread wouldn't able to work. 
A thread is lightweight whereas the process is heavyweight.
communication between process requires some Time whereas thread requires less time.
Threads can share the same memory area whereas process lives in separate.Process: program under execution is known as process

Thread:  Thread is a functionality which is executed with the other part of the program based on the concept of ""one with other""so thread is a part of process..The best answer I've found so far is Michael Kerrisk's 'The Linux Programming Interface':

In modern UNIX implementations, each process can have multiple threads
of execution. One way of envisaging threads is as a set of processes
that share the same virtual memory, as well as a range of other
attributes. Each thread is executing the same program code and shares
the same data area and heap. However, each thread has it own stack
containing local variables and function call linkage information. [LPI 2.12]

This book is a source of great clarity; Julia Evans mentioned its help in clearing up how Linux groups really work in this article.Threads within the same process share the Memory, but each thread has its own stack and registers, and threads store thread-specific data in the heap. Threads never execute independently, so the inter-thread communication is much faster when compared to inter-process communication.

Processes never share the same memory. When a child process creates it duplicates the memory location of the parent process. Process communication is done by using pipe, shared memory, and message parsing. Context switching between threads is very slow.Example 1: A JVM runs in a single process and threads in a JVM share the heap belonging to that process. That is why several threads may access the same object. Threads share the heap and have their own stack space. This is how one thread’s invocation of a method and its local variables are kept thread safe from other threads. But the heap is not thread-safe and must be synchronized for thread safety.Consider process like a unit of ownership or what resources are needed by a task. A Process can have resources like memory space, specific input/output, specific files, and priority etc.

A thread is a dispatchable unit of execution or in simple words the progress through a sequence of instructionsWhile building an algorithm in Python (interpreted language) that incorporated multi-threading I was surprised to see that execution time was not any better when compared to the sequential algorithm I had previously built. In an effort to understand the reason for this result I did some reading, and believe what I learned offers an interesting context from which to better understand the differences between multi-threading and multi-processes. 

Multi-core systems may exercise multiple threads of execution, and so Python should support multi-threading. But Python is not a compiled language and instead is an interpreted language1. This means that the program must be interpreted in order to run, and the interpreter is not aware of the program before it begins execution. What it does know, however, are the rules of Python and it then dynamically applies those rules. Optimizations in Python must then be principally optimizations of the interpreter itself, and not the code that is to be run. This is in contrast to compiled languages such as C++, and has consequences for multi-threading in Python. Specifically, Python uses the Global Interpreter Lock to manage multi-threading.

On the other hand a compiled language is, well, compiled. The program is processed ""entirely"", where first it is interpreted according to its syntactical definitions, then mapped to a language agnostic intermediate representation, and finally linked into an executable code. This process allows the code to be highly optimized because it is all available at the time of compilation. The various program interactions and relationships are defined at the time the executable is created and robust decisions about optimization can be made.

In modern environments Python's interpreter must permit multi-threading, and this must both be safe and efficient. This is where the difference between being an interpreted language versus a compiled language enters the picture. The interpreter must not to disturb internally shared data from different threads, while at the same time optimizing the use of processors for computations.

As has been noted in the previous posts both a process and a thread are independent sequential executions with the primary difference being that memory is shared across multiple threads of a process, while processes isolate their  memory spaces.

In Python data is protected from simultaneous access by different threads by the Global Interpreter Lock. It requires that in any Python program only one thread can be executed at any time. On the other hand it is possible to run multiple processes since the memory for each process is isolated from any other process, and processes can run on multiple cores.

What is the difference between functional and non-functional requirements? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 5 years ago. What is the difference between functional and non-functional requirements in the context of designing a software system? Give examples for each case.A functional requirement describes what a software system should do, while non-functional requirements place constraints on how the system will do so.

Let me elaborate.

An example of a functional requirement would be: 


A system must send an email whenever a certain condition is met (e.g. an order is placed, a customer signs up, etc).


A related non-functional requirement for the system may be: 


Emails should be sent with a latency of no greater than 12 hours from such an activity.


The functional requirement is describing the behavior of the system as it relates to the system's functionality. The non-functional requirement elaborates a performance characteristic of the system.

Typically non-functional requirements fall into areas such as:


Accessibility
Capacity, current and forecast
Compliance
Documentation
Disaster recovery
Efficiency
Effectiveness
Extensibility
Fault tolerance
Interoperability
Maintainability
Privacy
Portability
Quality
Reliability
Resilience
Response time
Robustness
Scalability
Security
Stability
Supportability
Testability


A more complete list is available at Wikipedia's entry for non-functional requirements.

Non-functional requirements are sometimes defined in terms of metrics (i.e. something that can be measured about the system) to make them more tangible. Non-functional requirements may also describe aspects of the system that don't relate to its execution, but rather to its evolution over time (e.g. maintainability, extensibility, documentation, etc.).functional requirements are the main things that the user expects from the software for example if the application is a banking application that application should be able to create a new account, update the account, delete an account, etc. functional requirements are detailed and are specified in the system design 

Non-functional requirement are not straight forward the requirement  of the system rather it is related to usability( in some way ) for example for a banking application a major non-functional requirement will be available the application should be available 24/7 with no downtime if possible.Functional requirements


Functional requirements specifies a function that a system or system component must be able to perform. It can be documented in various ways. The most common ones are written descriptions in documents, and use cases. 
Use cases can be textual enumeration lists as well as diagrams, describing user actions. Each use case illustrates behavioural scenarios through one or more functional requirements. Often, though, an analyst will begin by eliciting a set of use cases, from which the analyst can derive the functional requirements that must be implemented to allow a user to perform each use case.
Functional requirements is what a system is supposed to accomplish. It may be 


Calculations 
Technical details 
Data manipulation
Data processing
Other specific functionality

A typical functional requirement will contain a unique name and number, a brief summary, and a rationale. This information is used to help the reader understand why the requirement is needed, and to track the requirement through the development of the system.


Non-functional requirements

LBushkin have already explained more about Non-functional requirements. I will add more.


Non-functional requirements are any other requirement than functional requirements. This are the requirements that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. 
Non-functional requirements are in the form of ""system shall be "", an overall property of the system as a whole or of a particular aspect and not a specific function. The system's overall properties commonly mark the difference between whether the development project has succeeded or failed.
Non-functional requirements - can be divided into two main categories:


Execution qualities, such as security and usability, which are observable at run time.
Evolution qualities, such as testability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the software system.

Non-functional requirements place restrictions on the
product being developed, the development process,
and specify external constraints that the product must
meet.
The IEEE-Std 830 - 1993 lists 13 non-functional requirements to be included in a Software Requirements Document.



  
  Performance requirements
  Interface requirements
  Operational requirements
  Resource requirements
  Verification requirements
  Acceptance requirements
  Documentation requirements
  Security requirements
  Portability requirements
  Quality requirements
  Reliability requirements
  Maintainability requirements
  Safety requirements
  


Whether or not a requirement is expressed as a functional or a non-functional requirement may depend:


on the level of detail to be included in the requirements document
the degree of trust which exists between a system customer and a
system developer.


Ex. A system may be required to present the user with a display of the number of records in a database. This is a functional requirement. How up-to-date [update] this number needs to be, is a non-functional requirement. If the number needs to be updated in real time, the system architects must ensure that the system is capable of updating the [displayed] record count within an acceptably short interval of the number of records changing.

What is the difference between hardware and software breakpoints?,"What is the difference between hardware and software breakpoints? Are hardware breakpoints are said to be faster than software breakpoints, if yes then how, and also then why would we need the software breakpoints at all?This article provides a good discussion of pros and cons:
http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=80

To answer your question directly software breakpoints are more flexible because hardware breakpoints are limited in some functionality and highly architecture-dependant. One example given in the article is that x86 hardware has a limit of 4 hardware breakpoints.

Hardware breakpoints are faster because they have dedicated registers and less overhead than software breakpoints.Hardware breakpoints are actually comparators, comparing the current PC with the address in the comparator (when enabled). Hardware breakpoints are the best solution when setting breakpoints. Typically set via the debug probe (using JTAG, SWD, ...). The downside of hardware breakpoints: They are limited. CPUs have only a limited number of hardware breakpoints (comparators). The number of available hardware breakpoints depends on the CPU. ARM 7/9 cores have 2, modern ARM devices (Cortex-M 0,3,4) between 2 and 6,
x86 usually 4.

Software breakpoints are in fact set by replacing the instruction to be breakpointed with a breakpoint instruction. The breakpoint instruction is present in most CPUs, and usually as short as the shortest instruction, so only one byte on x86 (0xcc, INT 3). On Cortex-M CPUs, instructions are 2 or 4 bytes, so the breakpoint instruction is a 2 byte instruction.

Software breakpoints can easily be set if the program is located in RAM (such as on a PC). A lot of embedded systems have the program located in flash memory. Here it is not so easy to exchange the instruction, as the flash needs to be reprogrammed, so hardware breakpoints are used primarily. Most debug probes support only hardware breakpoints if the program is located in flash memory. However, some (such as SEGGER's J-Link) allow reprogramming the flash memory with breakpoint instruction and aso allow an unlimited number of (software) breakpoints even when debugging a program located in flash.

More info about software breakpoints in flash memoryYou can go through GDB internals, its very well explains the HW and SW breakpoints.
HW breakpoints are something that require support from MCU. The ARM controllers have special registers where you can write some address space, whenever PC (program counter) == sp register CPU halts. Jtag is usually required to write into those special registers.
SW breakpoints are implemented in GDB by inserting a trap, an illegal divide, or some other instruction that will cause an exception, and then when it’s encountered, gdb will take the exception and stop the program. When the user says to continue, gdb will restore the original instruction, single-step, re-insert the trap, and continue on.
There are a lot of advantages in using HW debuggers over SW debuggers especially if you are dealing with interrupts and memory bus devices. AFAIK interrupts cannot be debugged with software debuggers.In addition to the answers above, it is also important to note that while software breakpoints overwrite specific instructions in the program to know where to stop, the more limited number of hardware breakpoints are actually part of the processor.

Justin Seitz in his book Gray Hat Python points out that the important difference here is that by overwriting instructions, software breakpoints actually change the CRC of the file, and so any sort of program such as a piece of malware which calculates its CRC can change its behavior in response to breakpoints being set, whereas with hardware breakpoints it is less obvious that the debugger is stopping and stepping through certain chunks of code.In brief, hardware breakpoints make use of dedicated registers and hence are limited in number. These can be set on both volatile and non volatile memory. 

Software breakpoints are set by replacing the opcode of instruction in RAM memory with breakpoint instruction. These can be set only in RAM memory(Flash memory is not feasible to be written) and are not limited.

This article provides good explanation about breakpoints.

Thanks and regards,
Shivakumar V WWatchpoints is where it makes a huge difference
This is a case where hardware handling is much faster:
watch var
rwatch var
awatch var

When you enter those commands on GDB 7.7 x86-64 it says:
Hardware watchpoint 2: var

This hardware capability for x86 is mentioned at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_debug_register
It is likely possible because of the existing paging circuit, which manages every memory access.
The ""software"" alternative is to single step the program, which is very slow.
Compare that to regular breakpoints, where at least the software implementation injects an int3 instruction at the breaking point and lets the program run, so you only pay overhead when a breakpoint is hit.Some quote from the Intel System Debugger help doc:


  Hardware vs. Software Breakpoints 
  The debugger can use both hardware
  and software breakpoints, each of these has strengths and weaknesses:
  
  Hardware Breakpoints are implemented using the DRx architectural
  breakpoint registers described in the Intel SDM. They have the
  advantage of being usable directly at reset, being non-volatile, and
  being usable with flash or other read-only memory. The downside is
  that they are a finite resource. Software Breakpoints require
  modifying system memory as they are implemented by replacing the
  opcode at the desired location with a special instruction. This makes
  them an unlimited resource, but the memory dependency mean you cannot
  install them prior to a module being loaded in memory, and if the
  target software overwrites that memory then they will become invalid.
  In general, any debug feature that must be enabled by the debugger
  does not persist after a reset, and may be impacted after other
  architectural mode transitions such as SMM entry/exit or VM
  entry/exit. Specific examples include:
  
  CPU Reset will clear all debug features, except for reset break. This
  means for example that user-specified breakpoints will be invalid
  until the target halts once after reset. Note that this halt can be
  due to either a reset-break, or due to a user-initiated halt. In
  either case the debugger will restore the necessary debug features.
  SMM Entry/exit will disable/re-enable breakpoints, this means you
  cannot specify a breakpoint in SMRAM while halted outside of SMRAM. If
  you wish the break within SMRAM, you must first halt at the SMM
  entry-break and manually apply the breakpoint. Alternatively you can
  patch the BIOS to re-enable breakpoints when entering SMM, but this
  requires the ability to modify the BIOS which cannot be used in
  production code.Software breakpoints put an instruction in RAM that is executed like a TRAP when your program reaches that address.
While hardware breakpoints use a register of the CPU to implement the breakpoint itself. That is why the hardware breakpoints are much faster. And that is why we need software breakpoints: hardware breakpoints are limited to the processor number of registers dedicated to breakpoints.

What is the maximum length of a URL in different browsers?,"Short answer - de facto limit of 2000 characters
If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software.
If you are targeting particular browsers, see below for more details on specific limits.
Longer answer - first, the standards...
RFC 2616 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP/1.1) section 3.2.1 says

The HTTP protocol does not place
any a priori limit on the length of
a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
the URI of any resource they    serve,
and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
unbounded length if they    provide
GET-based forms that could generate
such URIs. A server    SHOULD return
414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
URI is longer    than the server can
handle (see section 10.4.15).

That RFC has been obsoleted by RFC7230 which is a refresh of the HTTP/1.1 specification. It contains similar language, but also goes on to suggest this:

Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in
practice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients
support, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.

...and the reality
That's what the standards say. For the reality, there was an article on boutell.com (link goes to Internet Archive backup) that discussed what individual browser and server implementations will support. The executive summary is:

Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers. Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users.

(Note: this is a quote from an article written in 2006, but in 2015 IE's declining usage means that longer URLs do work for the majority. However, IE still has the limitation...)
Internet Explorer's limitations...
IE8's maximum URL length is 2083 chars, and it seems IE9 has a similar limit.
I've tested IE10 and the address bar will only accept 2083 chars. You can click a URL which is longer than this, but the address bar will still only show 2083 characters of this link.
There's a nice writeup on the IE Internals blog which goes into some of the background to this.
There are mixed reports IE11 supports longer URLs - see comments below. Given some people report issues, the general advice still stands.
Search engines like URLs < 2048 chars...
Be aware that the sitemaps protocol, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. If you intend to use sitemaps, a limit has been decided for you! (see Calin-Andrei Burloiu's answer below)
There's also some research from 2010 into the maximum URL length that search engines will crawl and index. They found the limit was 2047 chars, which appears allied to the sitemap protocol spec. However, they also found the Google SERP tool wouldn't cope with URLs longer than 1855 chars.
CDNs have limits
CDNs also impose limits on URI length, and will return a 414 Too long request when these limits are reached, for example:

Fastly 8Kb
CloudFront 8Kb
CloudFlare 16Kb

Is this information up to date?
This is a popular question, and as the original research is ~14 years old I'll try to keep it up to date: As of Jan 2021, the advice still stands. Even though IE11 may possibly accept longer URLs, the ubiquity of older IE installations plus the search engine limitations mean staying under 2000 chars is the best general policy.The longest URLs I came across are data URLs

Example image URL from Google image results (11747 characters)

It then blew up with:

PART 3

Added

<headerLimits>
    <add header=""Content-type"" sizeLimit=""32768"" />

which didn't help at all. I finally decided to use fiddler to remove the referrer from header.

static function OnBeforeRequest(oSession: Session) {
    if (oSession.url.Contains(""localhost:50766"")) {
        oSession.RequestHeaders.Remove(""Referer"");
    }


Which did nicely.

Chrome: got to 15613 characters. (I guess it's a 16K limit for IIS)

And it failed again with:

4043WWW FAQs: What is the maximum length of a URL? has its own answer based on empirical testing and research. The short answer is that going over 2048 characters makes Internet Explorer unhappy and thus this is the limit you should use. See the page for a long answer.There is really no universal maximum URL length. The max length is determined only by what the client browser chooses to support, which varies widely. The 2,083 limit is only present in Internet Explorer (all versions up to 7.0). The max length in Firefox and Safari seems to be unlimited, although instability occurs with URLs reaching around 65,000 characters.
Opera seems to have no max URL length whatsoever, and doesn't suffer instability at extremely long lengths.On Apple platforms (iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS), the limit may be a 2 GB long URL scheme, as seen by this comment in the source code of Swift:


  // Make sure the URL string isn't too long.
// We're limiting it to 2GB for backwards compatibility with 32-bit executables using NS/CFURL
if ( (urlStringLength > 0) && (urlStringLength <= INT_MAX) )
{
...





On iOS, I've tested and confirmed that even a 300+ MB long URL is accepted. You can try such a long URL like this in Objective-C:

NSString *path = [@""a:"" stringByPaddingToLength:314572800 withString:@""a"" startingAtIndex:0];
NSString *js = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""window.location.href = \""%@\"";"", path];
[self.webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:js];


And catch if it succeed with:

- (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType
{
    NSLog(@""length: %@"", @(request.URL.absoluteString.length));
    return YES;
}The URI RFC (of which URLs are a subset) doesn't define a maximum length, however, it does recommend that the hostname part of the URI (if applicable) not exceed 255 characters in length:

URI producers should use names that
conform to the DNS syntax, even when
use of DNS is not immediately
apparent, and should limit these names
to no more than 255 characters in
length.

As noted in other posts though, some browsers have a practical limitation on the length of a URL.The HTTP 1.1 specification says:


  URIs in HTTP can be represented in
  absolute form or relative to some

  known base URI [11], depending upon
  the context of their use. The two

  forms are differentiated by the fact
  that absolute URIs always begin

  with a scheme name followed by a
  colon. For definitive information on

  URL syntax and semantics, see ""Uniform
  Resource Identifiers (URI):    Generic
  Syntax and Semantics,"" RFC 2396 [42]
  (which replaces RFCs    1738 [4] and
  RFC 1808 [11]). This specification
  adopts the    definitions of
  ""URI-reference"", ""absoluteURI"",
  ""relativeURI"", ""port"",

  ""host"",""abs_path"", ""rel_path"", and
  ""authority"" from that

  specification.
  
  The HTTP protocol does not place
  any a priori limit on the length of

  a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
  the URI of any resource they    serve,
  and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
  unbounded length if they    provide
  GET-based forms that could generate
  such URIs.* A server    SHOULD return
  414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
  URI is longer    than the server can
  handle (see section 10.4.15).
  
  Note: Servers ought to be cautious about depending on URI
  lengths
        above 255 bytes, because some older client or proxy
        implementations might not properly support these lengths.


As mentioned by @Brian, the HTTP clients (e.g. browsers) may have their own limits, and HTTP servers will have different limits.Microsoft Support says ""Maximum URL length is 2,083 characters in Internet Explorer"".

IE has problems with URLs longer than that. Firefox seems to work fine with >4k chars.In URL as UI Jakob Nielsen recommends:


  the social interface to the Web relies on email when users want to recommend Web pages to each other, and email is the second-most common way users get to new sites (search engines being the most common): make sure that all URLs on your site are less than 78 characters long so that they will not wrap across a line feed.


This is not the maximum but I'd consider this a practical maximum if you want your URL to be shared.Sitemaps protocol, which is a way for webmasters to inform search engines about pages on their sites (also used by Google in Webmaster Tools), supports URLs with less than 2048 characters. So if you are planning to use this feature for Search Engine Optimization, take this into account.ASP.NET 2 and SQL Server reporting services 2005 have a limit of 2028. I found this out the hard way, where my dynamic URL generator would not pass over some parameters to a report beyond that point. This was under Internet Explorer 8.Why is the Internet Explorer limit only 2K while IIS has a limit of 16K? I don't think it makes sense.

So I want to start an experiment about Ajax request URL size limits.

I have set my Tomcat HTTP connector's maxHttpHeaderSize=""1048576"". And prepared a very long URL.

Then I send a request with the long URL like the following:

var url=""/ajax/url-length.jsp"";
jQuery.ajax(url,{data:{q:""0"".repeat(1048000-url.length-4)}});


jQuery reports done. Tomcat reports the URL requested is 1048015 bytes. It was tested with Chrome 50 and Internet Explorer 11.

So web browsers won't truncate or limit your URL intentionally when sending Ajax requests.Limit request line directive sets the maximum length of a URL. By default, it is set to 8190, which gives you a lot of room. However other servers and some browses, limit the length more.

Because all parameters are passed on the URL line, items that were in password of hidden fields will also be displayed in the URL of course. Neither mobile should be used for real security measures and should be considered cosmetic security at best.It seems that Chrome at least has raised this limit. I pasted 20,000 characters into the bookmarklet and it took it.I have experience with SharePoint 2007, 2010 and there is a limit of the length URL you can create from the server side in this case SharePoint, so it depends mostly on, 1) the client (browser, version, and OS) and 2) the server technology, IIS, Apache, etc.According to the HTTP spec, there is no limit to a URL's length. Keep your URLs under 2048 characters; this will ensure the URLs work in all clients & server configurations. Also, search engines like URLs to remain under approximately 2000 characters.",,,,,1,2595,82.49,26.28,21.42,23.64,30.89,28.36,75.3,43.47,32.1,5.24,2.04,0.85,0.04,0.69,0,0.46,3.2,9.44,5.51,20.54,8.94,5.43,2.97,4.16,0.89,9.75,3.7,5.93,2.04,0.12,0.85,1.08,9.6,0.5,9.06,2.24,1.16,1.19,1.66,0.54,3.2,0,1.7,0.96,0.69,0.66,0,0.66,0,0,0.42,0.04,4.59,2.74,0.35,0.85,0,0,1.19,1.7,0,0,0,0.04,2.5,0,0,2.5,2.04,0.08,0.5,1.43,0.08,0,0.15,0.04,0,0,0.04,0,0,0.04,0,0,0.12,0.42,0,0.04,0,0.04,0.15,0.62,2.89,8.52,0.5,1.16,6.32,0.73,0,0.08,1.19,1.66,3.89,0.92,0.73,0.66,0.04,0,0.04,47.09,10.4,3.16,0.15,0.08,1.04,32.25,
What is the single most influential book every programmer should read?,"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 5 years ago. Software Engineering as it is taught today is entirely focused on object-oriented programming and the 'natural' object-oriented The new hype is functional programming, which is taught in many books and tutorials. But what about functional software engineering? 
While reading about Lisp and Clojure, I came about two interesting statements: Functional programs are often developed bottom up instead of top down ('On Lisp', Paul Graham) Functional Programmers use Maps where OO-Programmers use objects/classes ('Clojure for Java Programmers', talk by Rich Hickley). So what is the methodology for a systematic (model-based ?) design of a functional application, i.e. in Lisp or Clojure? What are the common steps, what artifacts do I use, how do I map them from the problem space to the solution space?Thank God that the software-engineering people have not yet discovered functional programming.  Here are some parallels:


Many OO ""design patterns"" are captured as higher-order functions.  For example, the Visitor pattern is known in the functional world as a ""fold"" (or if you are a pointy-headed theorist, a ""catamorphism"").  In functional languages, data types are mostly trees or tuples, and every tree type has a natural catamorphism associated with it.  

These higher-order functions often come with certain laws of programming, aka ""free theorems"".
Functional programmers use diagrams much less heavily than OO programmers.  Much of what is expressed in OO diagrams is instead expressed in types, or in ""signatures"", which you should think of as ""module types"".  Haskell also has ""type classes"", which is a bit like an interface type.

Those functional programmers who use types generally think that ""once you get the types right; the code practically writes itself.""

Not all functional languages use explicit types, but the How To Design Programs book, an excellent book for learning Scheme/Lisp/Clojure, relies heavily on ""data descriptions"", which are closely related to types.



  So what is the methodology for a systematic (model-based ?) design of a functional application, i.e. in Lisp or Clojure? 


Any design method based on data abstraction works well.  I happen to think that this is easier when the language has explicit types, but it works even without.  A good book about design methods for abstract data types, which is easily adapted to functional programming, is Abstraction and Specification in Program Development by Barbara Liskov and John Guttag, the first edition.  Liskov won the Turing award in part for that work.

Another design methodology that is unique to Lisp is to decide what language extensions would be useful in the problem domain in which you are working, and then use hygienic macros to add these constructs to your language.  A good place to read about this kind of design is Matthew Flatt's article Creating Languages in Racket.  The article may be behind a paywall. You can also find more general material on this kind of design by searching for the term ""domain-specific embedded language""; for particular advice and examples beyond what Matthew Flatt covers, I would probably start with Graham's On Lisp or perhaps ANSI Common Lisp.


  What are the common steps, what artifacts do I use?


Common steps:


Identify the data in your program and the operations on it, and define an abstract data type representing this data.
Identify common actions or patterns of computation, and express them as higher-order functions or macros.  Expect to take this step as part of refactoring.
If you're using a typed functional language, use the type checker early and often.  If you're using Lisp or Clojure, the best practice is to write function contracts first including unit tests—it's test-driven development to the max.  And you will want to use whatever version of QuickCheck has been ported to your platform, which in your case looks like it's called ClojureCheck. It's an extremely powerful library for constructing random tests of code that uses higher-order functions.For Clojure, I recommend going back to good old relational modeling. Out of the Tarpit is an inspirational read.Personally I find that all the usual good practices from OO development apply in functional programming as well - just with a few minor tweaks to take account of the functional worldview. From a methodology perspective, you don't really need to do anything fundamentally different.

My experience comes from having moved from Java to Clojure in recent years.

Some examples:


Understand your business domain / data model - equally important whether you are going to design an object model or create a functional data structure with nested maps. In some ways, FP can be easier because it encourages you to think about data model separately from functions / processes but you still have to do both. 
Service orientation in design - actually works very well from a FP perspective, since a typical service is really just a function with some side effects. I think that the ""bottom up"" view of software development sometimes espoused in the Lisp world is actually just good service-oriented API design principles in another guise.
Test Driven Development - works well in FP languages, in fact sometimes even better because pure functions lend themselves extremely well to writing clear, repeatable tests without any need for setting up a stateful environment. You might also want to build separate tests to check data integrity (e.g. does this map have all the keys in it that I expect, to balance the fact that in an OO language the class definition would enforce this for you at compile time).
Prototying / iteration - works just as well with FP. You might even be able to prototype live with users if you get very extremely good at building tools / DSL and using them at the REPL.OO programming tightly couples data with behavior. Functional programming separates the two. So you don't have class diagrams, but you do have data structures, and you particularly have algebraic data types. Those types can be written to very tightly match your domain, including eliminating impossible values by construction.

So there aren't books and books on it, but there is a well established approach to, as the saying goes, make impossible values unrepresentable.

In so doing, you can make a range of choices about representing certain types of data as functions instead, and conversely, representing certain functions as a union of data types instead so that you can get, e.g., serialization, tighter specification, optimization, etc.

Then, given that, you write functions over your adts such that you establish some sort of algebra -- i.e. there are fixed laws which hold for these functions. Some are maybe idempotent -- the same after multiple applications. Some are associative. Some are transitive, etc.

Now you have a domain over which you have functions which compose according to well behaved laws. A simple embedded DSL!

Oh, and given properties, you can of course write automated randomized tests of them (ala QuickCheck).. and that's just the beginning.Object Oriented design isn't the same thing as software engineering. Software engineering has to do with the entire process of how we go from requirements to a working system, on time and with a low defect rate. Functional programming may be different from OO, but it does not do away with requirements, high level and detailed designs, verification and testing, software metrics, estimation, and all that other ""software engineering stuff"".

Furthermore, functional programs do exhibit modularity and other structure. Your detailed designs have to be expressed in terms of the concepts in that structure.One approach is to create an internal DSL within the functional programming language of choice. The ""model"" then is a set of business rules expressed in the DSL.See my answer to another post:

How does Clojure aproach Separation of Concerns?

I agree more needs to be written on the subject on how to structure large applications that use an FP approach (Plus more needs to be done to document FP-driven UIs)While this might be considered naive and simplistic, I think ""design recipes"" (a systematic approach to problem solving applied to programming as advocated by Felleisen et al. in their book HtDP) would be close to what you seem to be looking for.

Here, a few links:

http://www.northeastern.edu/magazine/0301/programming.html

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.86.8371I've recently found this book:
Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling

I think is perfectly in line with your question.

From the book description:


  Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling teaches you how to think of the domain model in terms of pure functions and how to compose them to build larger abstractions. You will start with the basics of functional programming and gradually progress to the advanced concepts and patterns that you need to know to implement complex domain models. The book demonstrates how advanced FP patterns like algebraic data types, typeclass based design, and isolation of side-effects can make your model compose for readability and verifiability.There is the ""program calculation"" / ""design by calculation"" style associated with Prof. Richard Bird and the Algebra of Programming group at Oxford University (UK), I don't think its too far-fetched to consider this a methodology.

Personally while I like the work produced by the AoP group, I don't have the discipline to practice design in this way myself. However that's my shortcoming, and not one of program calculation.I've found Behavior Driven Development to be a natural fit for rapidly developing code in both Clojure and SBCL. The real upside of leveraging BDD with a functional language is that I tend to write much finer grain unit tests than I usually do when using procedural languages because I do a much better job of decomposing the problem into smaller chunks of functionality.Honestly if you want design recipes for functional programs, take a look at the standard function libraries such as Haskell's Prelude.  In FP, patterns are usually captured by higher order procedures (functions that operate on functions) themselves.  So if a pattern is seen, often a higher order function is simply created to capture that pattern.

A good example is fmap.  This function takes a function as an argument and applies it to all the ""elements"" of the second argument.  Since it is part of the Functor type class, any instance of a Functor (such as a list, graph, etc...) may be passed as a second argument to this function.  It captures the general behavior of applying a function to every element of its second argument.Well,

Generally many Functional Programming Languages are used at universities for a long time for ""small toy problems"".

They are getting more popular now since OOP has difficulties with ""paralel programming"" because of ""state"".And sometime functional style is better for problem at hand like Google MapReduce.

I am sure that, when functioanl guys hit the wall [ try to implement systems bigger than 1.000.000 lines of code], some of them will come with new software-engineering methodologies with buzz words :-). They should answer the old question: How to divide system into pieces so that we can ""bite"" each pieces one at a time? [ work iterative, inceremental en evolutionary way] using Functional Style.


  It is sure that Functional Style will effect our Object Oriented
  Style.We ""still"" many concepts from Functional Systems and adapted to
  our OOP languages.


But will functional programs will be used for such a big systems?Will they become main stream? That is the question.

And Nobody can come with realistic methodology without implementing such a big systems, making his-her hands dirty.

Much like a conventional home designing software :) After the room is designed i should be able to to make the user walk through it... I know that is a lot of requirements... But are there any open source IDE's/API's/Engines that can i use to achieve similar results?What you need to use depends on the level of realism you want to achieve.

For a simple(ish) start, try Google Sketchup - there is a vast array of samples online: http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/

For something more powerful (and complicated to use), try Blender

You'll then need to use an API to render and allow user movement - for this, take a look at JMonkeyEngine

FYI - There is a more complete list of modeling apps on the jMonkeyEngine site.It's not really programming related, but look at Google SketchUp. It also has a powerful SDK which you can use.For SDK search for '3d scenegraph' in google. Some good ones are Ogre3d, Irrlicht and OpenSceneGraph.

What rules does software version numbering follow? [duplicate],"I have been developing some software and want to give it version numbers. How do I do this? How is it that some software gets two versions like 1.3v1.1 or some have 3 numbers - 4.0.1 What is the method behind all this? Thanks.The usual method I have seen is X.Y.Z, which generally corresponds to major.minor.patch:


Major version numbers change whenever there is some significant change being introduced. For example, a large or potentially backward-incompatible change to a software package.
Minor version numbers change when a new, minor feature is introduced or when a set of smaller features is rolled out.
Patch numbers change when a new build of the software is released to customers. This is normally for small bug-fixes or the like.


Other variations use build numbers as an additional identifier. So you may have a large number for X.Y.Z.build if you have many revisions that are tested between releases. I use a couple of packages that are identified by year/month or year/release. Thus, a release in the month of September of 2010 might be 2010.9 or 2010.3 for the 3rd release of this year.

There are many variants to versioning. It all boils down to personal preference.

For the ""1.3v1.1"", that may be two different internal products, something that would be a shared library / codebase that is rev'd differently from the main product; that may indicate version 1.3 for the main product, and version 1.1 of the internal library / package.You might find the Semantic Versioning Specification useful.",,,,,1,265,62.24,17.53,49.95,42.62,17.67,24.91,86.04,67.55,52.45,9.06,2.64,1.51,0,1.13,0,0,6.42,16.6,7.92,6.79,10.94,11.32,5.28,5.66,0,15.47,8.68,9.81,0.38,0.38,0,0,18.49,0.75,17.74,2.64,3.4,1.51,5.66,0,6.04,0,1.51,1.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.4,1.51,0.38,0.38,0,0.38,0.38,1.89,0,0,0,0,1.51,0,0,1.51,3.02,0,0,3.02,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.79,4.91,0.38,0.38,3.4,0.38,0,0,5.66,1.89,5.28,2.26,0,0,0,0,0,20,12.08,2.64,0.75,0,0.38,4.15,

What's the difference between Apache's Mesos and Google's Kubernetes,"What exactly is the difference between Apache's Mesos and Google's Kubernetes?
I understand both are server cluster management software. Can anyone elaborate where the main differences are - when would which framework be preferred? Why would you want to use Kubernetes on top of Mesosphere?Kubernetes is an open source project that brings 'Google style' cluster management capabilities  to the world of virtual machines, or 'on the metal' scenarios.  It works very well with modern operating system environments (like CoreOS or Red Hat Atomic) that offer up lightweight computing 'nodes' that are managed for you.  It is written in Golang and is lightweight, modular, portable and extensible.  We (the Kubernetes team) are working with a number of different technology companies (including Mesosphere who curate the Mesos open source project) to establish Kubernetes as the standard way to interact with computing clusters.  The idea is to reproduce the patterns that we see people needing to build cluster applications based on our experience at Google. Some of these concepts include:


pods — a way to group containers together
replication controllers — a way to handle the lifecycle of containers
labels — a way to find and query containers, and
services — a set of containers performing a common function.  


So with Kubernetes alone you will have something that is simple, easy to get up-and-running, portable and extensible that adds 'cluster' as a noun to the things that you manage in the lightest weight manner possible.  Run an application on a cluster, and stop worrying about an individual machine.  In this case, cluster is a flexible resource just like a VM.  It is a logical computing unit.  Turn it up, use it, resize it, turn it down quickly and easily. 

With Mesos, there is a fair amount of overlap in terms of the basic vision, but the products are at quite different points in their lifecycle and have different sweet spots.  Mesos is a distributed systems kernel that stitches together a lot of different machines into a logical computer. It was born for a world where you own a lot of physical resources to create a big static computing cluster.  The great thing about it is that lots of modern scalable data processing application run well on Mesos (Hadoop, Kafka, Spark) and it is nice because you can run them all on the same basic resource pool, along with your new age container packaged apps.  It is somewhat more heavy weight than the Kubernetes project, but is getting easier and easier to manage thanks to the work of folks like Mesosphere. 

Now what gets really interesting is that Mesos is currently being adapted to add a lot of the Kubernetes concepts and to support the Kubernetes API.  So it will be a gateway to getting more capabilities for your Kubernetes app (high availability master, more advanced scheduling semantics, ability to scale to a very large number of nodes) if you need them, and is well suited to run production workloads (Kubernetes is still in an alpha state).

When asked, I tend to say:


Kubernetes is a great place to start if you are new to the clustering world;  it is the quickest, easiest and lightest way to kick the tires and start experimenting with cluster oriented development.  It offers a very high level of portability since it is being supported by a lot of different providers (Microsoft, IBM, Red Hat, CoreOs, MesoSphere, VMWare, etc).
If you have existing workloads (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, etc), Mesos gives you a framework that let's you interleave those workloads with each other, and mix in a some of the new stuff including Kubernetes apps.
Mesos gives you an escape valve if you need capabilities that are not yet implemented by the community in the Kubernetes framework.Both projects aim to make it easier to deploy & manage applications inside containers in your datacenter or cloud.

In order to deploy applications on top of Mesos, one can use Marathon or Kubernetes for Mesos.

Marathon is a cluster-wide init and control system for running Linux services in cgroups and Docker containers.  Marathon has a number of different canary deploy features and is a very mature project.

Marathon runs on top of Mesos, which is a highly scalable, battle tested and flexible resource manager. Marathon is proven to scale and runs in many production environments. 

The Mesos and Mesosphere technology stack provides a cloud-like environment for running existing Linux workloads, but it also provides a native environment for building new distributed systems.

Mesos is a distributed systems kernel, with a full API for programming directly against the datacenter. It abstracts underlying hardware (e.g. bare metal or VMs) away and just exposes the resources. It contains primitives for writing distributed applications (e.g. Spark was originally a Mesos App, Chronos, etc.) such as Message Passing, Task Execution, etc. Thus, entirely new applications are made possible. Apache Spark is one example for a new (in Mesos jargon called) framework that was built originally for Mesos. This enabled really fast development - the developers of Spark didn't have to worry about networking to distribute tasks amongst nodes as this is a core primitive in Mesos.

To my knowledge, Kubernetes is not used inside Google in production deployments today. For production, Google uses Omega/Borg, which is much more similar to the Mesos/Marathon model. However the great thing about using Mesos as the foundation is that both Kubernetes and Marathon can run on top of it.

More resources about Marathon:

https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/

Video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZNGST2vIdsKubernetes and Mesos are a match made in heaven. Kubernetes enables the Pod (group of co-located containers) abstraction, along with Pod labels for service discovery, load-balancing, and replication control. Mesos provides the fine-grained resource allocations for pods across nodes in a cluster, and can make Kubernetes play nicely with other frameworks running on the same cluster resources.


from readme of kubernetes-mesosMesos and Kubernetes can both be used to manage a cluster of machines and abstract away the hardware.

Mesos, by design, doesn't provide you with a scheduler (to decide where and when to run processes and what to do if the process fails), you can use something like Marathon or Chronos, or write your own.

Kubernetes will do scheduling for you out of the box, and can be used as a scheduler for Mesos (please correct me if I'm wrong here!) which is where you can use them together. Mesos can have multiple schedulers sharing the same cluster, so in theory you could run kubernetes and chronos together on the same hardware.

Super simplistically: if you want control over how your containers are scheduled, go for Mesos, otherwise Kubernetes rocks.I like this short video here mesos learning material

with bare metal clusters, you would need to spawn stacks like HDFS, SPARK, MR etc... so if you launch tasks related to these using only bare metal cluster management, there will be a lot cold starting time.

with mesos, you can install these services on top of the bare metals and you can avoid the bring up time of those base services. This is something mesos does well. and can be utilised by kubernetes building on top of it.Mesos and Kubernetes both are container orchestration tools.
When you say ""Google Kubernetes""?

Google Kubernetes Engine provides a managed environment for deploying,
managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google
infrastructure.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.” Kubernetes was built by Google based on their experience running containers in production over the last decade.
The major components in a Kubernetes cluster are:
pods — a way to group containers together
replication controllers — a way to handle the lifecycle of containers
labels — a way to find and query containers, and
services — a set of containers performing a common function
Mesos is an open-source cluster management project by Apache, designed to scale to very large clusters, from hundreds to thousands of hosts. Mesos supports diverse kinds of workloads such as Hadoop tasks, cloud native applications etc. It gives you the ability to run both containerized, and non-containerized workloads in a distributed manner.
It was initially written as a research project at Berkeley and was later adopted by Twitter as an answer to Google’s Borg (Kubernetes’ predecessor). To combat its high degree of complexity (Mesos is super complicated and hard to manage!), Mesosphere came into the picture to try and make Mesos into something regular human beings can use.
Mesosphere supplied the superb Marathon “plugin” to Mesos, which provides users with an easy way to manage container orchestration over Mesos.
In mid-2016, DC/OS (Data Center Operating System) — an open source project backed by Mesosphere — was introduced, which simplifies Mesos even further and allows you to deploy your own Mesos cluster, with Marathon, in a matter of minutes.
Now, if we compare kubernetes and Mesos(DC/OS)
kubernetes is a cluster manager for containers while mesos is a distributed system kernel that will make your cluster look like one giant computer system to all supported frameworks and apps that are built to be run on mesos.
Mesos was born for a world where you own a lot of physical resources to create a big static computing cluster. The great thing about it is that lots of modern scalable data processing application runs very well on Mesos (Hadoop, Kafka, Spark) and it is nice because you can run them all on the same basic resource pool, along with your new age container packaged apps.
Mesos cluster also runs alongside the Marathon cluster. Marathon, created by Mesosphere, is designed to start, monitor and scale long-running applications, including cloud native apps. Clients interact with Marathon through a REST API.
Also, a point to be noted is that you can actually run Kubernetes on top of DC/OS and schedule containers with it instead of using Marathon. This implies the biggest difference of all — DC/OS, as it name suggests, is more similar to an operating system rather than an orchestration framework. You can run non-containerized, stateful workloads on it. Container scheduling is handled by the Marathon.""I understand both are server cluster management software.""

This statement isn't entirely true. Kubernetes doesn't manage server clusters, it orchestrates containers such that they work together with minimal hassle and exposure. Kubernetes allows you to define parts of your application as ""pods"" (one or more containers) that are delivered by ""deployments"" or ""daemon sets"" (and a few others) and exposed to the outside world via services.
However, Kubernetes doesn't manage the cluster itself (there are tools that can provision, configure and scale clusters for you, but those are not part of Kubernetes itself).

Mesos on the other hand comes closer to ""cluster management"" in that it can control what's running where, but not just in terms of scheduling containers. Mesos also manages standalone software running on the cluster servers. Even though it's mostly used as an alternative to Kubernetes, Mesos can easily work with Kubernetes as while the functionality overlaps in many areas, Mesos can do more (but on the overlapping parts Kubernetes tends to be better).",,,,,1,1854,83.18,49.36,44.58,44.47,22.61,27.67,78.48,62.14,47.57,8.2,3.34,0.38,0.27,2.27,0,0.38,4.85,12.41,7.23,0.43,14.62,6.96,3.94,6.15,0.49,12.89,6.69,6.47,3.18,0.81,0.92,1.46,12.14,0.22,11.87,1.78,2.37,1.83,1.56,0.38,3.83,0,2.59,2.1,0.49,0.22,0,0.22,0.11,0,0,0,6.04,2.32,0.43,0.16,0.05,0.05,0.65,3.72,0.05,0,0,0.11,2,0.05,0,1.94,4.75,0.05,0,4.64,0,0.05,0.32,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,0,0.05,0,0.22,0.11,0.27,0.11,0.05,0,0,0.11,0.38,3.34,11.17,0.11,1.83,8.74,0.38,0,0.16,2.64,1.56,6.26,0.32,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,16.94,4.96,5.23,0.27,0.11,1.13,5.23,
What's the difference between Software-Generated Interrupt and Software-Generated Exception?,"I am reading the Intel Manual 3A Chapter 6 Interrupt and Exception Handling.

Interrupt and Exception have 3 sources respectively.

For Software-Generated Interrupt, it says:

The INT n instruction permits interrupts to be generated from within software by supplying an interrupt vector number as an operand. For example, the INT 35 instruction forces an implicit call to the interrupt handler for interrupt 35. Any of the interrupt vectors from 0 to 255 can be used as a parameter in this instruction. If the processor’s predefined NMI vector is used, however, the response of the processor will not be the same as it would be from an NMI interrupt generated in the normal manner. If vector number 2 (the NMI vector) is used in this instruction, the NMI interrupt handler is called, but the processor’s NMI-handling hardware is not activated. Interrupts generated in software with the INT n instruction cannot be masked by the IF flag in the EFLAGS register.

For Software-Generated Exceptions, it says:

The INTO, INT 3, and BOUND instructions permit exceptions to be generated in software. These instructions allow checks for exception conditions to be performed at points in the instruction stream. For example, INT 3 causes a breakpoint exception to be generated. The INT n instruction can be used to emulate exceptions in software; but there is a limitation. If INT n provides a vector for one of the architecturally-defined exceptions, the processor generates an interrupt to the correct vector (to access the exception handler) but does not push an error code on the stack. This is true even if the associated hardware-generated exception normally produces an error code. The exception handler will still attempt to pop an error code from the stack while handling the exception. Because no error code was pushed, the handler will pop off and discard the EIP instead (in place of the missing error code). This sends the return to the wrong location.

So, what's the difference? Seems both leverage the int n instruction. How can I tell whether it generates an exception or an interrupt in a piece of assembly code?In the x86 architecture an exception is handled as an interrupt, nominally with an interrupt handler.
So interrupts and exceptions are terms that overlaps, the latter are a kind of the former.

Interrupt numbers from 0 to 31 are reserved for CPU exceptions, for example interrupt number 0 is the #DE (Divide error), interrupt number 13 is the #GP (General Protection).

When the CPU detects a condition that should rise an exception (like an access to a non present page) it performs a series of tasks.

First it pushes an error code if needed, some exceptions (like #PF and #GP) do, some (like #DE) don't.
The Section 6.15 of the Intel manual 3 lists all the exceptions with their eventual error code.

Secondly it ""calls"" the appropriate interrupt handler which is like a far call but with EFLAGS pushed on the stack.

int n does only the second step, it calls an interrupt but doesn't push any error code as there is no error condition in the hardware in the first place (and because int n was there before the concept of error codes).
So it can be used to emulate exceptions, the software has to eventually push an appropriate error code.

When you see int n in the code, it is never an exception. It is an interrupt, that eventually is used to steer the control flow into a particular OS exception handler.",,,,,1,584,93.99,4.52,32.26,18.22,19.47,25.68,79.97,58.05,49.66,4.28,0.68,0.34,0,0.17,0,0.17,3.6,18.15,14.38,3.77,13.01,8.22,3.42,5.99,1.54,13.01,2.74,3.08,0.86,0,0,0.86,16.44,0.68,15.41,0.51,4.45,1.54,1.71,0,8.22,0,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.22,7.88,0,0,0,0.17,2.91,0.34,0,0,0,0,1.54,0,0,1.54,4.62,0,0,4.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,2.23,6.68,0.17,1.71,4.79,0.17,0,0,1.54,2.57,5.99,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,15.92,5.14,3.94,0.34,0,0.86,5.65,
What's the difference between a proxy server and a reverse proxy server?,"A pair of simple definitions would be:

Forward Proxy: Acting on behalf of a requestor (or service consumer)

Reverse Proxy: Acting on behalf of  service/content producer.I found the diagram below to be very helpful. It just shows the architecture of a forward vs. reverse proxy setup from client to server over the Internet. This image will help you to understand qyb2zm302's answer and other answers better.



You can also watch this video from F5's DevCentral by Peter Silva.

Picture Source: Quora. However, as per Martijn Pieters, this image could be from Pulse Secure Community or Julien Pauli's site (in French) at developpez.com.

It reminded me of the classic proverb:


  A picture is worth 1000 words.Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy (2012) explains the difference between forward and reverse proxies very clearly.

qyb2zm302's answer nicely details applications of proxies, but it slips up on the fundamental concept between forward and reverse proxies. For the reverse proxy, X → Y → Z, X knows about Y and not Z, rather than vice versa.

A proxy is simply a middleman for communication (requests + responses). Client <-> Proxy <-> Server


Client proxy: ( client <-> proxy ) <-> server


The proxy acts on behalf of the client. The client knows about all three machines involved in the chain. The server doesn't.


Server proxy: client <-> ( proxy <-> server )


The proxy acts on behalf of the server. The client only knows about the proxy. The server knows the whole chain.

It seems to me that forward and reverse are simply confusing, perspective-dependent names for client and server proxy. I suggest abandoning the former for the latter, for explicit communication.

Of course, to further complicate the matter, not every machine is exclusively a client or a server. If there is an ambiguity in context, it's best to explicitly specify where the proxy lies, and the communications that it tunnels.Some diagrams might help:

Forward proxy



Reverse proxyProxy: It is making the request on behalf of the client. So, the server will return the response to the proxy, and the proxy will forward the response to the client. In fact, the server will never ""learn"" who the client was (the client's IP address); it will only know the proxy. However, the client definitely knows the server, since it essentially formats the HTTP request destined for the server, but it just hands it to the proxy.



Reverse Proxy: It is receiving the request on behalf of the server. It forwards the request to the server, receives the response and then returns the response to the client. In this case, the client will never ""learn"" who was the actual server (the server's IP address) (with some exceptions); it will only know the proxy. The server will or won't know the actual client, depending on the configurations of the reverse proxy.The best explanation is here with diagrams:

While a forward proxy proxies on behalf of clients ( or requesting hosts ), a reverse proxy proxies on behalf of servers.

In effect, whereas a forward proxy hides the identities of clients, a reverse proxy hides the identities of servers.A proxy server proxies (and optionally caches) outgoing network requests to various not-necessarily-related public resources across the Internet. A reverse proxy captures (and optionally caches) incoming requests from the Internet and distributes them to various internal private resources, usually for high availability purposes.Proxy (Forward Proxy):

When computers on your LAN connect to a proxy server that accesses the Internet. Benefits include only the server being exposed to the Internet. People on the outside are unable to access the computers directly.
Forward proxies can improve Internet access for users by caching downloads. They can also be used to restrict access to certain sites. Also, only the proxy server would need a public address, not the clients connecting to it.

Reverse Proxy:

A reverse proxy is the opposite of a forward proxy. Instead it acts as a proxy on behalf of the servers being connected to. Instead of accessing a remote server directly, a user would go through the reverse proxy and get directed to the appropriate 
server from there. Only the reverse proxy would need an SSL certificate, only one public IP address would be needed, and it can handle load balancing of incoming requests to enhance the overall user experience. 



Image Source: Creating a Forward Proxy Using Application Request RoutingCloudflare has a great article with images explaining this in details.
  
  Check here:
  What Is A Reverse Proxy? | Proxy Servers ExplainedMy understanding from an Apache perspective is that proxy means that if site x proxies for site y, then requests for x return y.

The reverse proxy means that the response from y is adjusted so that all references to y become x.

So that the user cannot tell that a proxy is involved...Forward proxies grant the client anonymity (i.e, think Tor).

Reverse proxies grant back end servers anonymity (i.e, think servers behind a DMZ).As per my understanding...
To start with, as everyone knows, proxy means ""the authority to represent someone else"". Now there are two things, forward and reverse proxy.
Forward proxy
Suppose you want to access ""Google"" and ""Google"" in turn will have n number of servers to respond to that particular request.
Now in this case, while you are requesting for something from Google and you don’t want Google to see your IP address, then you will use a forward proxy, as explained below.
A → B → C
Now here you are A, sending a request through B. So C will think that the request is coming from B, not A. In this way you can prevent your clients IP address not to be exposed to outer world.
Reverse proxy
Now in this case, to make you understand, we will take the same case of forward proxy. Here you have requested for something to Google, which in turn going to send the one request to the app server or another proxy server to get the response. So these things will happen as explained below.
A  → B  → C
C  → D
C  ← D
A ← B ← C
From the above diagram you can see that a request has been sent to C from B, not from A. Then from C there will be one request send to D. Similarly the response will go to C from D and then to B and A.
The above diagram says it's only the context which matters although both the proxies are acting the same way, but the client-side proxy is hiding the client information whereas the server-side proxy will hide server-side information.Here's an example of a reverse proxy (as a load balancer).

A client surfs to website.com and the server it hits has a reverse proxy running on it. The reverse proxy happens to be Pound. Pound takes the request and sends it to one of the three application servers sitting behind it. In this example, Pound is a load balancer. That is, it is balancing the load between three application servers.

The application servers serve up the website content back to the client.A forward proxy serves users: it helps users access the server.

A reverse proxy serves the server: it protects the server from users.If no proxy

To see from the client side and server side are the same:

Client   ->   Server

Proxy

From the client side:

Client  ->  proxy -> Server

From the server side:

Client  ->  Server

Reverse proxy

From the client side:

Client  ->  Server

From the server side:

Client  ->  proxy -> Server

So I think if it set up by a client user，it is called a proxy； if it set up by a server manager it is a reverse proxy.

Because the purposes and reasons for setting it up are different, they deal with data in different ways and use different software.

   User side          |      Server side
client  <->  proxy  <-->  reverse_proxy <-> real serverDifference between Proxy server (also called forward proxy) and Reverse Proxy Server depends on the point of reference.
Technically, both are exactly the same. Both serve the same purpose of transmitting data  to a destination on behalf of a source.
The difference lies in 'on whose behalf is the proxy server acting / who is the proxy server representing?'
If the proxy server is forwarding requests to internet server on behalf of the end users (Example: students in a college accessing internet through college proxy server.), then the proxy is called 'Forward proxy' or simply 'Proxy'.
If the proxy server is responding to incoming requests, on behalf of a server, then the proxy is called 'Reverse Proxy', as it is working in the reverse direction, from the point of view of the end user.
Some Examples of Reverse proxies:

Load balancer in front of web servers acts as a reverse-proxy on behalf of the actual web servers.
API gateway
Free Website hosting services like (facebook pages / blog page servers) are also reverse proxies. The actual content may be in some web server, but the outside world knows it through specific url advertised by reverse-proxy.

Use of forward proxy:

Monitor all outbound internet connections from an organization
Apply security policies on internet browsing and block malicious content from being downloaded
Block access to specific websites

Use of Reverse proxy:

Present friendly URL for a website
Perform load balancing across multiple web servers
Apply security policy and protect actual web servers from attacksLooking from the perspective of the user: when sending a request to a proxy or reverse proxy server:


proxy - requires two arguments: 

1) what to get and 2) which proxy server to use an intermediate


reverse proxy - requires one argument: 

1) what to get


A reverse proxy fetches contents from another server unbeknownst to the user and returns the result as if it originated from the reverse proxy server.Most of the previous answers are good, but in my opinion none comes very close to addressing well enough the ""reverse"" quality that differentiates the two. To do that, some way of visualizing the ""reverse"" nature of what is essentially the same thing (a proxy) needs to be given, and it needs to be given in a well abstracted way.

A proxy (implicitly ""forward proxy"") connects multiple local clients to any one remote server:

c--
   |--p--s
c--


A reverse proxy connects multiple local servers to any one remote client (notice how the layout reverses):

s--
   |--p--c
s--


It is a matter of perspective really and properly understanding the concept requires abstracting away non-essential (to the particular concept) details though they may be very important when it comes to the pragmatics of proxy operation. Such details include the fact that in both scenarios the reality is that multiple clients connect to multiple servers, that clients and servers may not really be local or remote, where the Internet cloud is located or what kind of visibility exists between client and server.Let's consider the purpose of the service.
In forward proxy:
Proxy helps user to access server.
In reverse proxy:
Proxy helps server to be accessed by user.
In the latter case, the one who is helped by the proxy is no longer a user, but a server, that's the reason why we call it a reverse proxy.",,,,,1,1865,93.45,38.19,37.06,25.05,22.74,24.56,74.05,56.46,47.18,6.38,1.88,0.48,0.16,0.75,0,0.21,4.5,15.66,11.8,1.07,13.78,5.9,3.75,5.31,0.86,11.21,4.29,2.31,3.27,0.59,0.43,2.25,12.44,0.75,11.58,2.84,1.98,1.07,2.04,0.64,4.02,0.05,1.66,1.02,0.64,0.54,0.11,0.43,0,0.16,0.21,0,9.01,4.61,0.48,1.29,0.21,0,1.45,4.13,0,0,0,0.05,1.93,0,0.05,1.88,3.81,0.05,0,3.7,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0.11,0.48,0,0.05,0,0.05,0.54,0.05,2.57,8.9,0.16,0.91,7.67,0.86,0,0,1.45,1.02,5.04,1.29,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,19.46,5.58,3.43,0.11,0,1.18,9.17,
"What's the difference between unit, functional, acceptance, and integration tests?","Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 6 years ago. The community reviewed whether to reopen this question last month and left it closed: Original close reason(s) were not resolved What is the difference between unit, functional, acceptance, and integration testing (and any other types of tests that I failed to mention)?Depending on where you look, you'll get slightly different answers.  I've read about the subject a lot, and here's my distillation; again, these are slightly wooly and others may disagree.

Unit Tests

Tests the smallest unit of functionality, typically a method/function (e.g. given a class with a particular state, calling x method on the class should cause y to happen).  Unit tests should be focussed on one particular feature (e.g., calling the pop method when the stack is empty should throw an InvalidOperationException).  Everything it touches should be done in memory; this means that the test code and the code under test shouldn't:


Call out into (non-trivial) collaborators
Access the network  
Hit a database
Use the file system
Spin up a thread
etc.


Any kind of dependency that is slow / hard to understand / initialise / manipulate should be stubbed/mocked/whatevered using the appropriate techniques so you can focus on what the unit of code is doing, not what its dependencies do. 

In short, unit tests are as simple as possible, easy to debug, reliable (due to reduced external factors), fast to execute and help to prove that the smallest building blocks of your program function as intended before they're put together.  The caveat is that, although you can prove they work perfectly in isolation, the units of code may blow up when combined which brings us to ...

Integration Tests

Integration tests build on unit tests by combining the units of code and testing that the resulting combination functions correctly.  This can be either the innards of one system, or combining multiple systems together to do something useful.  Also, another thing that differentiates integration tests from unit tests is the environment.  Integration tests can and will use threads, access the database or do whatever is required to ensure that all of the code and the different environment changes will work correctly.  

If you've built some serialization code and unit tested its innards without touching the disk, how do you know that it'll work when you are loading and saving to disk?  Maybe you forgot to flush and dispose filestreams.  Maybe your file permissions are incorrect and you've tested the innards using in memory streams.  The only way to find out for sure is to test it 'for real' using an environment that is closest to production.

The main advantage is that they will find bugs that unit tests can't such as wiring bugs (e.g. an instance of class A unexpectedly receives a null instance of B) and environment bugs (it runs fine on my single-CPU machine, but my colleague's 4 core machine can't pass the tests).  The main disadvantage is that integration tests touch more code, are less reliable, failures are harder to diagnose and the tests are harder to maintain.

Also, integration tests don't necessarily prove that a complete feature works.  The user may not care about the internal details of my programs, but I do!

Functional Tests

Functional tests check a particular feature for correctness by comparing the results for a given input against the specification.  Functional tests don't concern themselves with intermediate results or side-effects, just the result (they don't care that after doing x, object y has state z). They are written to test part of the specification such as, ""calling function Square(x) with the argument of 2 returns 4"". 

Acceptance Tests

Acceptance testing seems to be split into two types:

Standard acceptance testing involves performing tests on the full system (e.g. using your web page via a web browser) to see whether the application's functionality satisfies the specification. E.g. ""clicking a zoom icon should enlarge the document view by 25%."" There is no real continuum of results, just a pass or fail outcome. 

The advantage is that the tests are described in plain English and ensures the software, as a whole, is feature complete.  The disadvantage is that you've moved another level up the testing pyramid. Acceptance tests touch mountains of code, so tracking down a failure can be tricky.  

Also, in agile software development, user acceptance testing involves creating tests to mirror the user stories created by/for the software's customer during development.  If the tests pass, it means the software should meet the customer's requirements and the stories can be considered complete. An acceptance test suite is basically an executable specification written in a domain specific language that describes the tests in the language used by the users of the system.

Conclusion

They're all complementary.  Sometimes it's advantageous to focus on one type or to eschew them entirely.  The main difference for me is that some of the tests look at things from a programmer's perspective, whereas others use a customer/end user focus.The important thing is that you know what those terms mean to your colleagues.  Different groups will have slightly varying definitions of what they mean when they say ""full end-to-end"" tests, for instance. 

I came across Google's naming system for their tests recently, and I rather like it - they bypass the arguments by just using Small, Medium, and Large.  For deciding which category a test fits into, they look at a few factors - how long does it take to run, does it access the network, database, filesystem, external systems and so on.

http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2010/12/test-sizes.html

I'd imagine the difference between Small, Medium, and Large for your current workplace might vary from Google's.  

However, it's not just about scope, but about purpose.  Mark's point about differing perspectives for tests, e.g. programmer vs customer/end user, is really important.http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/

Martin Fowler's blog post speaks about strategies to test code (Especially in a micro-services architecture) but most of it applies to any application.

I'll quote from his summary slide:


  
  Unit tests - exercise the smallest pieces of testable software in the application to determine whether they behave as expected.
  Integration tests - verify the communication paths and interactions between components to detect interface defects.
  Component tests - limit the scope of the exercised software to a portion of the system under test, manipulating the system through
  internal code interfaces and using test doubles to isolate the code
  under test from other components.
  Contract tests - verify interactions at the boundary of an external service asserting that it meets the contract expected by a consuming
  service.
  End-To-End tests -  verify that a system meets external requirements and achieves its goals, testing the entire system, from
  end to end.Unit Testing - As the name suggests, this method tests at the object level. Individual software components are tested for any errors. Knowledge of the program is needed for this test and the test codes are created to check if the software behaves as it is intended to.

Functional Testing - Is carried out without any knowledge of the internal working of the system. The tester will try to use the system by just following requirements, by providing different inputs and testing the generated outputs. This test is also known as closed-box testing or black-box.

Acceptance Testing - This is the last test that is conducted before the software is handed over to the client. It is carried out to ensure that the developed software meets all the customer requirements. There are two types of acceptance testing - one that is carried out by the members of the development team, known as internal acceptance testing (Alpha testing), and the other that is carried out by the customer or end user known as (Beta testing) 

 Integration Testing - Individual modules that are already subjected to unit testing are integrated with one another. Generally the two approachs are followed :

1) Top-Down

2) Bottom-UpThis is very simple.


Unit testing: This is the testing actually done by developers that have coding knowledge. This testing is done at the coding phase and it is a part of white box testing. When a software comes for development, it is developed into the piece of code or slices of code known as a unit. And individual testing of these units called unit testing done by developers to find out some kind of human mistakes like missing of statement coverage etc..
Functional testing: This testing is done at testing (QA) phase and it is a part of black box testing. The actual execution of the previously written test cases. This testing is actually done by testers, they find the actual result of any functionality in the site and compare this result to the expected result. If they found any disparity then this is a bug.
Acceptance testing: know as UAT. And this actually done by the tester as well as developers, management team, author, writers, and all who are involved in this project. To ensure the project is finally ready to be delivered with bugs free.
Integration testing: The units of code (explained in point 1) are integrated with each other to complete the project. These units of codes may be written in different coding technology or may these are of different version so this testing is done by developers to ensure that all units of the code are compatible with other and there is no any issue of integration.Some (relatively) recent ideas against excessive mocking and pure unit-testing:

Why Most Unit Testing is WasteI will explain you this with a practical example and no theory stuff:

A developer writes the code. No GUI is implemented yet. The testing at this level verifies that the functions work correctly and the data types are correct. This phase of testing is called Unit testing.

When a GUI is developed, and application is assigned to a tester, he verifies business requirements with a client and executes the different scenarios. This is called functional testing. Here we are mapping the client requirements with application flows.

Integration testing: let's say our application has two modules: HR and Finance. HR module was delivered and tested previously. Now Finance is developed and is available to test. The interdependent features are also available now, so in this phase, you will test communication points between the two and will verify they are working as requested in requirements.

Regression testing is another important phase, which is done after any new development or bug fixes. Its aim is to verify previously working functions.unit test: testing of individual module or independent component in an application is known to be unit testing , the unit testing will be done by developer.

integration test: combining all the modules and testing the application to verify the communication and the data flow between the modules are working properly or not , this testing also performed by developers.

funcional test checking the individual functionality of an application is mean to be functional testing

acceptance testing this testing is done by end user or customer whether the build application is according to the customer requirement , and customer specification this is known to be acceptance testing",,,,,1,1917,79.4,28.84,28.7,32.53,22.55,28.59,82.47,61.29,47.94,8.29,2.82,0.63,0.21,0.94,0.1,0.89,5.48,15.55,8.71,1.67,12.99,8.76,3.55,6.05,0.78,17.27,4.28,3.34,2.66,0.73,1.36,0.73,14.24,0.68,13.35,2.56,2.03,1.15,2.5,0.63,5.16,0.16,2.66,1.77,0.89,0.47,0,0.47,0,0.1,0,0,6.05,2.5,0.16,0.05,0.16,0.05,1.41,3.39,0,0,0,0.1,1.88,0,0,1.88,10.07,0,0,9.96,0.63,0,0.05,0.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,0.05,0.94,0.05,0.42,0.1,0.21,0.05,0.16,2.82,7.09,0.83,1.2,4.49,0.37,0,0.26,2.24,3.23,6.16,1.2,0.37,0.37,0,0,0,19.51,6.16,3.76,0.16,0.05,1.62,7.77,
When software problems reported are not really software problems,"Apologies if this has already been covered or you think it really belongs on wiki. I am a software developer at a company that manufactures microarray printing machines for the biosciences industry. I am primarily involved in interfacing with various bits of hardware (pneumatics, hydraulics, stepper motors, sensors etc) via GUI development in C++ to aspirate and print samples onto microarray slides. On joining the company I noticed that whenever there was a hardware-related problem this would cause the whole setup to freeze, with nobody being any the wiser as to what the specific problem was - hardware / software / misuse etc. Since then I  have improved things somewhat by introducing software timeouts and exception handling to better identify and deal with any hardware-related problems that arise eg PLC commands not successfully completed, inappropriate FPGA response commands, and various other deadlock type conditions etc.  In addition, the software will now log a summary of the specific problem, inform the user and exit the thread gracefully. This software is not embedded, just interfacing using serial ports. In spite of what has been achieved, non-software guys still do not fully appreciate that in these cases, the 'software' problem they are reporting to me is not really a software problem, rather the software is reporting a problem, but not causing it. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing I enjoy more than to come down on software bugs like a ton of bricks, and looking at ways of improving robustness in any way.  I know the system well enough now that I almost have a sixth sense for these things. No matter how many times I try to explain this, nothing really penetrates.  They still report what are essentially hardware problems (which eventually get fixed) as software ones. I would like to hear from any others that have endured similar finger-pointing experiences and what methods they used to deal with them. UPDATE
Some great responses here that pretty much sing from the same hymn sheet: be more descriptive. I guess identifying the command and bombing out cleanly when the hardware fails was the first stage, but was still not quite enough. The next stage will be to map what are to the layman fairly meaningless PLC commands to something more suggestive. ""PLC Command M71 timeout"" becomes ""Failure to initialize syringe system. Check adequate vacuum reached"" and so on...Perhaps when reporting the problem either as a message to the user or an entry in the log file you need to make it explicitly clear that it's the hardware that's at fault:


  ""Stepper motor not responding"".


Unfortunately, because it's the software that people see and interact with they assume that the software is all that there is.You could try labeling the error messages as ""HARDWARE PROBLEM"". Might get your point across.There's no such thing as non-software problem in a system. Software is the boss, and the boss cannot blame failure for the tools.

If underlying hardware is malfunctioning, it should report to the user what exactly went wrong with which component. If it didn't, it is a software problem. 

For example, TCP disconnection means it have to reconnect. If it's an FPGA response, it should tell exactly what were the inputs and the outputs to the user, and who is to blame. If not, this is a software problem.""If what you're doing isn't working, stop doing it and try something else""

As pointed out in other comments, it's a communcation and to a lesser extent, perception problem.  People will blame what they don't understand FAR more easily to make themselves feel like a victim.  A motor could be sparking, throwing fire and explode from someone grossly overloading a feeder (with EVERY warning not to plastered all over it) -- but if that software stops responding, guess what caused the problem?

Since giving every one of your users a EE and CS class or 10 is completely out of the question, fall back on good ole communication.  The basis of which is 4 things (mostly my opinion) in no particular order - What you observe, what you feel, what you think and what should be done.  So with this idea, I'll put into practice by giving this response.

It seems like your users like to blame software when some of the underlying hardware is the key issue (observe).  Trying to explain this with the users about this is impractical and a waste of time, that's not their job and most of them won't care (feel).  What you may want to try is talking with the engineering team about the parts they're using and look into things that work better with software in general.  Maybe there's some constraints of the inputs that were never considered? (think) Changing out the hardware or just a better understanding of it might be the real answer as well as more targeted errors and feedback to those users (done).I agree with the other posters, but I wanted to add another perspective:  It could be worse.  They could be attempting to solve the hardware problems for days or weeks, and then find out later, when everyone is under the gun and has been going crazy about it not getting fixed, that they were addressing the wrong problem and it was, in fact, a software problem.  So count your blessings.  If they always classify it as a software problem, at least you know about it.  Only then can you troubleshoot, maybe put in additional problem-solving or problem-identifying code, and make the system a tiny bit better.

Also, this is pretty much the same as every software developer everywhere has ever faced.  Except usually it is the software versus the user, not the software versus the hardware.  And in that case, it appears there is no known solution.  Lots of ways to address the problem, but no way to fix it.  Thus the ever-growing list of acronyms describing how to blame the user without being rude:  ID-ten-T error, PICNIC, PEBKAC, etc.Who is it who's reporting the problems?

If it's the end users, I think this is a non-issue. They just know that what they're trying to do is not working. It's not the user's responsibility to diagnose the problem. All they know is, ""I tried to do X, Y should have happened, but instead Z happened."" Everything beyond that is your problem.

If the hardware folks are insisting that the problem is in the software and the software folks are insisting that the problem is in the hardware, then you need to enhance the software to diagnose errors more precisely, as ChrisF and others have noted.

If the higher-ups are blaming the software group for problems that are the responsibility of the hardware group and you're sick of taking the blame for other people's mistakes, okay, I understand that. Again, as the software guy, you have the power to create more precise error messages. If you can explicitly say, ""Stepper motor not responding"" or whatever, then you have the ""moral authority"" to insist that someone run diagnostics on the stepper motor. Just saying, ""I'm pretty sure it's a hardware problem"" isn't going to win an argument.Test-oriented development (not necessary means 'test-driven') is want you should resourced to.

Basically, every sub-systems should have a reasonably thorough set of unit tests to identify problem before integration. Every time a problem occurs test the hardware so you can know for sure (or almost sure) that it is the hardware problem. This means that hardware must be designed in the way that it can be thoroughly tested.

I was a integration head for my college robot team and this tactic helps a lot.

Hope this helps.First, make sure your users are more likely to read and understand your error messages. Displaying ""FPGA command GS_WIDGIT_FROB returned invalid response 0xFF45001C. Shutting down controller id 576D. (Error 1Xf)"" might be great for you. But, the user is likely to hit ""Ok"" without reading it. Even if they do read it, it tells them no useful information. Either way, you're getting a phone call. Display ""Widgit Frobber requires maintenance"", but still log all the heavy details somewhere, and you're likely to get less calls.

Second, you know it's a hardware problem so do something about it! Have your software email hardware support, or whatever it takes to get the problem fixed. If the user is forced to decide what action to take to fix it, you can bet they'll get it wrong at least some of the time. If the user sees ""Widgit Frobber requires maintenance. Hardware support has been notified (ticket #234)"" they know that they don't have to do a thing.",,,,,1,1446,43.01,25.19,32.12,22.83,20.08,22.89,87,68.33,57.33,13.83,5.33,1.59,0,2.07,0,1.45,8.51,16.04,8.3,0.83,11.69,10.24,5.53,6.92,2.35,17.63,5.33,3.73,3.39,0.41,1.8,1.18,21.44,1.73,19.64,4.01,2.01,2.42,4.56,0.83,5.67,0,3.87,2.01,1.8,0.69,0.35,0.28,0,0.21,0,0,9.75,4.98,0.62,0.07,0.21,1.04,2.56,4.77,0.14,0,0,0.14,3.73,0,0,3.73,2.42,0.14,0,2.07,0.07,0.14,0.41,0.21,0.07,0,0,0,0,0.07,0,0.48,0.28,0.76,0.28,0.35,0,0.14,0.07,0.07,5.6,5.74,0.69,0.69,3.53,0.62,0.21,0.35,2.49,2.14,6.71,1.31,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,18.74,5.39,5.12,0.21,0.07,2.42,5.53,

	You should always upgrade in the following order: IPS software > custom theme (and other third-party stuff). You will get the incompatible message during the first step.

	1. Themes will stay ""accessible"" to be updated or removed. For minor upgrades it will be sufficient to use ""Upload new version"" feature. But in case of large upgrades such as 4.4 to 4.7, you should do a fresh installation of your custom theme.



	2. That would be the theme currently set as ""default"". For safety reasons, I always swap a default theme from my custom theme to the Default theme before upgrading. Then after upgrading I upload a new version of my theme and set it back to ""default"".The above is correct, however I would say it terms of number 1 there, it atcually depends even on a large upgrade. If you havent change much for example, it may be a case of just reverting a template and re-adding your changes. If its a custom theme written by someone else, you really should refer to that person for advice before you upgradeThank you. My theme is very basic, it's the default factory Invision theme that I have customized by adding the ad code from my ad publisher. So I'm not sure if I will need to re-customize a new default theme or if I'll be able to somehow update my theme and keep the ad code, or will have to simply reapply the ad code?If you have edited a template, just for that (presumably globalTemplate) then you would just revert that theme, and reapply the codeOn 9/9/2022 at 5:56 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

			What does ""revert a theme"" means exactly and how do I do that?Sorry, that should have read ""Revert that template"" rather than that themeOk I did a test on a copy of a template to check and apparently ""Revert"" removes all custom HTML but not the custom CSS or the customizations made with the Easy Editor Mode, which wasn't obvious to me, so that's good news. I'm going to try to update now.Revert just reverts that individual template you are on at the time.Ok so I did not revert any templates, I performed the upgrade, everything went well and the themes that were supposedly incompatible are still working exactly the same as before. The ad code is still there, all the custom modifications I had made to the HTML are still there. 



	So I'm unclear as to whether the template files were updated successfully or not, or if there's anything left for me to do?Any template that is manually edited by yourself will not have been amended in any way by the upgrade procedure. Therefore the templates mentioned, you should check. Take a look at this, which gives you a better idea of how to check these by comparisonOn 9/9/2022 at 7:56 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

Which Project Management Software is adequate for Software & Non-Software Projects? [closed],"We don’t allow questions seeking recommendations for books, tools, software libraries, and more. You can edit the question so it can be answered with facts and citations. Closed 4 years ago. PMS = (Project Management Software) I used trac for software development some time ago. Right now I'm searching for a new more powerful (scheduling, gantt charts, ...) free solution (as in free beer ;-) and free to install on my server) for my current software project. Besides the current software project, abstract project management features like issue-tracking & scheduling would be great for coordinating a group of volunteers for real-life projects as well. I would want one solution for both purposes, so that I have the hassle of installation, getting used to the system and administration only once. So I tried redmine but the problem is it seems to be designed for software projects only. I can't suggest such a solution for the volunteer-group if tickets/issues would have to be of type bug, feature, ... I shortlisted the following six PMS from the wikipedia comparison: I guess they are all more or less fine for software development but would you consider any of these to be good for the non-software project as well? Cliff Notes: I would want a start page situation like in trac.
The start-page is a wiki presenting the project and not the PMS. But you can log into the PMS from there. Feature-wish list: wiki, Issue tracking, revision control, scheduling & gantt charts, forums (least important)
(Btw: I'm very aware that I can't expect everything to be perfect ;-) Do you know a suitable solution for software and real-life projects or a highly customizable PMS where I can easily remove sth. like ""browse source""(trac) and rename things like ticket/issue-types ""bug"", ""feature""? Any experience good/bad with the above mentioned six PMS? 
I would personally guess that ""Redmine"" and ""Endeavour Software Project Management"" are too focused on software projects.Take a look at project kaiser (http://www.projectkaiser.com). It's a web-based project management and issue tracking software, with Gantt, wikis and forums included. Successfully used in both software and non-software projects.You might want to try setting up different ""trackers"" and workflows in Redmine.  You should be able to name these different processes in non-software language.  If you're willing to edit a little code, you can also change the labels on a lot of things pretty easily.  E.g., Version becomes Milestone.I'm a core contributor to web2project and most of our users are not software people at all. In fact, it appears that law firms and contractors (as in the building construction type) are nearly 80% of our installed based on surveys.

In our case, everything revolves around the concept of a Project - tasks, files, forums, helpdesk tickets, even risks - and is treated that way.Take a look at the IT derivative of our project management portal product (free open source version is available) http://yoxel.com/project-management-portal.html

Which software development methodology? [closed],"I'm a member of a software development team, working on a small project. We think that we can release a beta quality product after 2 or 3 month of continuos work.

Since this is our first teamwork, I decided to ask, which software development methodology would you suggest for a small project with small number of developers (less than 10)?There are two approaches to software development:

Write down what you are going to do, do it, then agree that you have done it.
Start developing stuff, agree that what you have done is good, repeat until finished.
Both have their adherents and both pop up repeatedly under a variety of names. Each new generation of software developers (ie about every 2 years, this is a fast changing industry and software developers have the lifespan of a mayfly) rejects the previous generation's approach, re-discovers the approach used by the generation before last, renames it something funky and declares it to be the ONE TRUE WAY.

The choice between the approaches ought to depend on the culture of (a) the customer organisation and (b) to a lesser extent, the culture of the supplier organisation (ie your software developer team).

So, if you work for a buttoned-down conservative enterprise approach 1 is indicated. If you look down and see that you are wearing surf shorts and came to work this morning on your skateboard, go with approach 2.

And, in case you have read this far, the most serious bit is the paragraph before the one before this final one, ie the one starting 'The choice ...' This is a cultural / organisational issue rather than a technical one. Both approaches have been used on many many successful projects, neither has a monopoly on unsuccesful projects.This really does depend on what you are intending to build. If the project is going to be something you want to build upon and have regular intervales something like Agile / Scrum would be very suited.

But it really depends on what the project is to determine release iterations and the like etc.I think that you need to start from Joel Test and try to implement most of this list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joel_Test

And as product development use KISS = Keep It Simple & Stupid, for first release

Also really good start is Getting Real book, available free from 37 signals: http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.phpThis really does depend on your customer.

If the customer can accept fixed time, fixed resources, fixed quality (100% working code), and slightly variable scope, I recommend choosing an agile methodology.

If the customer cannot accept the above, i.e. the pre-condition for using an agile methodology is not present, I recommend choosing any methodology you like.

The important thing is that you do have a methodology, learn what is working as you go, and use the knowledge to adapt the methodology.Don't do waterfall, this never worked and will never work. Thinking waterfall is a working methodology is like thinking banging your head against the wall is good, because even the sturdiest wall MUST crumble at some point.

I'd go with a reasonable agile methodology, like Scrum (XP is a bit harsh). Also, introduce things like TDD, DDD, DBC and you should be fine. wont suggest this as THE best answer, without having a better idea of the context and circumstances, but I am personally becoming a fan of the Lean / Kanban approach. In general I find a lot of the agile / scrum methods can be fairly developer focused, and almost anti-manager sometimes, which is sometimes appropriate but not always. The lean approaches tend to address the entire value stream rather than just the development itself.

Who Uses Software Watermarking?,"I'm a PhD student looking at software watermarking techniques and I always get asked 'who uses it?' The answer to which I don't know. There is a large amount of academic work on the subject (most notably from Collberg et al.) but very little indication of it's prevalence in industry. Software watermarking involves embedding a unique identifier into software in order to prove ownership, in a similar way to that of multimedia watermarking. So, maybe programmers here can answer the question: 'who uses software watermarking?'Thats a very interesting question. I would have up-voted you if I got the permission;-).

I actually wonderred the same question 4 years ago when I was doing my masters on dynamic software watermarks. I heard from some sources that IBM once won a law suit on copyright cases against some company, where software watermark actually got used as a hard evidence. But saidly its merely a heresay as I cannot find any source for that story. 

Another case is that a chinese company successfully proved that google china stole their dict data and used in google's chinese PinYin input system. See this 

I dont really have an answer to your question. But I believe software watermarks will be recogised as a powerful tool not only in the acdemic world. The reason is with the burst of app store iphone/ipad/android applications, there is real money,lots of money involved in the piracy--anti-piracy battle. 

There have been so many cases that people simply download paid apps and reverse engineer them,make minor modifications and then claim copyright and release the apps to make money. 

So I will bet a company will be there that speciallises in utilising software watermarks to prove owership, might combind with using obfuscation to make reverser engineering harder.

The market is huge, the problem is getting bigger and the solution has been established (at least in acdemic world) ;-) 

It might be time for me to re-read my paper and see what I can do to make some money ;-).The following case is often used as a typical example 
(Excerpt from the book ""Surreptious Software"", from Christian Collberg & Jasvir Nagra) :


  IBM sued a rival for theft of their PC-AT ROM. They argued that the defendant’s programmers pushed and popped registers in the same order as in the original code, which was essentially a birthmark. They also argued that it would be highly unlikely for two programs to both say push R1; push R2; add when push R2; push R1; add is semantically equivalent


Counsel for IBM Corporation. Software birthmarks. Talk to BCS Technology of Software Protection Special Interest Group. (1985)Having worked at three completely different places before, I can say that obfuscation is commonly used - all of them do. Watermarking? Well, I'm only hearing of it now.

Who pays developers of open-source software? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post. Closed 7 years ago. We are facing a lot of open source software. But someone needs to write that software. How are they payed? Do you know a good article about the open source politics and economy? Sometimes the big companies themselves release open source because they have some benefits.
Then they sell support, advices ... My question is what is the real economy about open software?
No professional will work for nothing. This software are couple of classes but thousand or may be millions of classes. If you are really a pro you will write software for money, because you have life, wife, kids, taxes, you must earn.
Please do not tell me that they are doing this for pleasure or hobby!On Stack Overflow, we get a lot of good quality answers (and questions).

But somebody needs to write the answers.  How are they paid?  Surely no professional would spend time hanging out here and answering questions for nothing.

...

This, of course, is not how it works: people get pleasure from contributing to something, from testing and extending their knowledge, from being part of a community.  Thus they write for SO in their spare time, and enjoy doing so.

Free software is no different.Eric S. Raymond wrote The Cathedral and the Bazaar and other essays about this, and these are probably the best place to start.  There's also a Joel on Software essay somewhere with some good points.

Some people write free/open source software because it's something they personally want.  Some do it as part of a reputation game, similar to academia.  Some people get paid for it.

Companies pay for it because they make money off it somehow.  O'Reilly Books makes money by selling books on using free software.  Red Hat makes money by providing enterprise-quality support.  Apple makes money by adapting it to their needs and selling computers using it.  I think IBM is working on Linux so they can slowly move away from AIX.  Some companies find it more economical to develop free software in conjunction with other companies, so everybody can use it and nobody has to pay too much.

Companies that make their money selling software, like Microsoft, will generally avoid free software.  Companies that make their money on something related to software will want the software as cheap as possible, preferably free.  In some cases, this means software the customers use, and in some cases this means software for internal use.Most of what I've done on FOSS projects has been unpaid, either building a tool or some functionality that I need at the time - ""scratching my own itch"", as ESR puts it.  This doesn't mean that it doesn't make me money.  As a freelancer, the tool I build/improve today could help me land a project tomorrow or help me get an existing project done more quickly, either of which is good for my bank account.

Back when I was working as someone else's employee, there were also times when I developed code on the clock that would help with my job, or other employees' jobs, but my employer wasn't in the business of selling software anyhow, so they were willing to let me release it under a FOSS license.

Today, I offer clients a discount on work done for them which will be released under a FOSS license, in which case I would be getting paid directly for work on FOSS code.  Nobody's actually taken me up on it yet, but a current client has asked whether certain parts of their project would be suitable for open sourcing, so they're clearly open to such arrangements and looking for an opportunity to get that discount.

Edited to add:  Freelancing has not been kind to me in the six months since I originally posted this answer (too hard to find paying clients for my language of choice), so I have accepted a full-time job with the local university's library, where I will be helping to clean up their in-house collection management application so that it can be released under a FOSS license sometime next year.

So, yes, there are jobs out there where writing FOSS is the primary job responsibility.  I suspect that they're mostly in the public sector or at educational institutions, but there are also some private corporations (like, say, Red Hat) where such jobs can be found.When you say ""professional"", by definition you are establishing the value and compensation context of your question/statement. But software is not just created as an outcome of the fruits of a profession. Software is art. Some writers have to write, some painters have to paint. Coders need to code. We all acknowledge that it would be nice to be paid for doing what we are. Some are better at it than others is all.Look at Linux, MySql and many others. There are huge corporations behind the most successful projects, so people will work there as they'd do for any other employer.

A detailed discussion here: http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/04/27/0048250/Why-Making-Money-From-Free-Software-MattersMost open source software work is done completely unpaid.

Some open source software is useful enough that a company that would benefit from the software being better will ""donate"" developers to work on it.  For example, RedHat - who markets a paid version of linux - may pay for developers to improve certain parts of GNU Linux.

Some open source software has paid support, or paid consultants.  So, MySQL was free, but also offered professional consulting based around the software they were already experts on.

But most open source work?  Unpaid.  Normally, it's a great thing to put on a resume to get you a paying gig.I am currently working on several open source (GPL) projects. Pay comes from various government grants via the local university.I found a good article: The simple econimics of open source by Josh Lerner:My guess: 


60% of open source development is
done by developers payed by
corporations
20% is done by developers which like to learn and improve (also having in mind their day jobs)

Why does software have EULA? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 9 years ago. This is the only product that I know that a consumer must agree to something that only lawyer can (something) understand. I'm sure car accidents kill more people each year than software accidents. But I don't sign anything like an EULA when I buy a car. So why does software have EULA? Were there a bad accident that triggered the need for software companies to protect themselves? (and what was the first software that had EULA?) [Update] Just to clear my point: I don't understand why software have EULA. No other product that I can think of does (not even gun)! So what makes software different that this product needs some sort of ""liability limitations""? By the way, Wikipedia says that ""The legal status of shrink-wrap licenses in the US is somewhat unclear.""The difference is that you are purchasing a license to use software, not the software itself (which the software company still owns).  The EULA stipulates the method with which you can use the software.  Similar agreements are in place when you rent things (e.g. a home), lease equipment, etc.An EULA is designed to be a contract that conveys or limits “usage” rights, hence the name End User Licensing Agreement. It has nothing more to do with a copyright than the mortgage loan contract that I have with my bank. That is why the legality of shrink-wrapped licenses is questionable. It is a contract that you do not get to read until after you purchase a product. It is clear from many responses here that the vast majority of people have not wrapped their heads around the idea the copyright does not extend to “usage” rights.

One responder wrote “Actually, the book is yours but the rights to the book are not. Just as in software, you purchased the physical media, but are bound by law on how you can use it.” Nothing could be farther from the truth. There is no law that restricts how you can use the book. Any restriction on usage would have to be agreed upon by you and the retailer as part of the sale.

Consider that in the absence of copyright, the copying and distribution of books would be perfectly legal. A book would be typical tangible property and nothing more. Copyright limits your ability to legally copy and distribute the content of the book. No additional agreement is necessary. Copyright in no way dictates how you can use your book and copyright law does not convey to the author the power to convey, limit, or negotiate “usage” rights. The only way that they can limit usage rights is through a separate contract that would have to be completed as part of the sale or rental.

There was some confusion regarding the GPL. The GPL is not an EULA. It is a copyright license that permits copying and distribution of the content so long as you comply with the restrictions of the license. In absence of the GPL (say you choose not to accept it), you can still use the software, but you are restricted from copying or distributing the software by Copyright Law.

EULA exist for various purposes. Companies that develop software want to negotiate a position that puts them at the least risk and gives them maximum leverage.If a consumer receives software without any license, consider what they might consider their rights:


They may believe they can copy the software, as many times as they want.
They may consider re-selling the software, and still keeping a copy for them self.
They may believe the software must work perfectly, with zero bugs (as they understand a bug)
They may believe it is fully waranteed against any perceived defect, and try to return it, for a full refund, at any point in the future.


In short, the EULA disabuses consumers of these notions.  It defines ownership and copyright of the software, limits on its use, distribution, features, and quality.

Now it is true that as lawyers get involved in the EULAs more and more, stranger and stranger provisions creep in, such as provisions that you cannot review the software on a blog, or you cannot bad-mouth the software to the press, or that the publisher owns content created with the software.

But fundamentally, the EULA is supposed to be about the producer and the consumer coming to an understanding of what is, and is not, an acceptable use of the software.Actually, what is quite funny, in Germany EULAs are pretty much legally-non binding, since you only get to see them after the purchase, so for us the answer to your question is:
To intimidate the user from doing stuff the company does not wantThere are basically three reasons for EULAs:


Software is much more copyable than any other product I can think of.  It is almost never left on its distribution medium.  That creates a huge temptation to, for example, buy one copy of Windows and install it on all of a company's thousand computers.  Developers want to explicitly lay out how many computers the software may be installed on.
Software often has undetected problems.  Even the best QA department never finds all the bugs in a software product.  Developers know this and want to be legally covered.
Software can often be easy to take apart to discover a developer's trade secrets or other information the developer doesn't want others to know.  Developers want to legally restrict this to protect their advantage over competitors.


Of course, there are sometimes other reasons for other terms.  EULAs for Apple's Mac applications, for example, usually state that you can only install the software on an Apple-branded computer; this ensures that Apple's software (which is usually sold much cheaper than it would be from any other developer) increases sales of Apple hardware.  The GNU GPL tries to ensure that the innovations in derivative software remain available to the community that developed the original.  There are as many reasons as there are clauses.It depends on the exact wording of the EULA.  Often, it's written to reinforce existing laws, such as copyright, by directly informing the user that it's unlawful to copy the program.  It also adds on other restrictions such as no reverse engineering, restricting the intellectual property.

Additional clauses may include ""not to be used in nuclear projects"" or similar.  This is merely covering the developer's bases, as it is extremely unlikely that a nuclear system developer would use a non-realtime, non-approved system without extreme amounts of research.

A further clause could restrict certain classes of users, such as military or government, which the developer feels strongly against.

As for which software had the first EULA, I have no idea.Cars and guns technically have something like a EULA... we just call them ""licenses"". You have to learn the limitations and rules of their operation, then take some tests and sign some papers.Nobody has mentioned the obligations of the provider, which are often in the EULA too.  If I make your software a critical piece of my corporate infrastructure and you go bust I want to be able to get my hands on the code so your failure doesn't precipitate mine.

As someone said, this is more akin to a rental agreement than a purchase agreement, which is why the analogy with a gun does not really apply.For proprietary software, License tells about your right to use specific software copy and impossibility to re-sell it, also your and software authors rights and charges

For open source software, License also tells about your right and charge about source code (distribute, do not do that, do that with limitations)When you use a gun at a firing range, don't you have to sign some type of release or waiver?  The logic is similar.",,,,,1,1320,62.32,30.77,16.73,14.43,20.31,25.15,84.77,67.12,57.12,11.67,5.15,1.21,0.15,2.35,0,1.44,6.52,18.11,9.55,0.61,13.26,9.39,5.45,6.21,2.5,15.61,5.3,3.86,4.47,0.23,1.06,3.33,18.18,1.36,16.82,3.11,2.73,2.8,4.02,0.83,5.08,0,2.05,0.76,1.29,0.3,0.08,0.23,0.08,0,0,0,6.89,2.12,0,0.08,0.08,0,1.59,4.62,0,0,0,0,4.02,0.3,0,3.71,5.45,0,0.23,4.02,1.82,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,1.06,0.68,0.98,0.15,0.3,0,0.08,0.3,0.38,3.86,4.39,0.15,0.38,3.94,0.08,0,0.08,1.89,1.14,6.74,1.36,0.08,0,0.08,0,0,15.3,5.3,4.55,0.45,0.08,1.06,3.86,
Will I have issues logging in to WordPress if I cancel?,"Hi there, my membership business didn't work out and so my membership with invision will end soon. 



	I noticed that the login page for my wordpress site has changed to invision brand colours when I installed it last year.



	When I cancel, will I have problems logging in, and do I need to do something to revert back to the default wordpress login page?



	I mention this because I had issues logging in today with my normal password and I think it could be indirectly related to the fact I have a customized login page. Please excuse my ignorance on this matter. I'm still learning!



			
				


	Edited August 31 by Anthony CameronYour WordPress software and your Invision Community software operate independently so no, in general, you should not lose access on either side to the core software of each platform should one be removed.



	With that said, there is no information here if you setup any kind of SSO or integration with authentication. If you setup authentication so that you used Invision Community as the ""source"" for your authentication, then any account on WordPress that used Invision Community to authenticate would not work when your Invision Community platform is shut down.



	If you have any questions, please let us know.The reality is here, if you are referring to your wordpress site, we have no knowledge of how you have that set up. If you are using invision logins to log into wordpress, you would need whoever set that up for you to revert back to your standard wordpress logins. Its not something in which we would be able to assist.On 8/31/2022 at 8:15 AM,   Jim M said:

	Technically different letters, but I don't know how they are treated in PHP/MySQL, is as different letters or the same letter with a different accent, similarly to what happens with a/ã/á/à, for example.

	No, they don't match. Hence the issue and the need to add a new entry in the word filters for that variant.

Writing Great Software [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 4 years ago. I'm currently reading Head First's Object Oriented Analysis and Design. The book states that to write great software (i.e. software that is well-designed, well-coded, easy to maintain, reuse, and extend) you need to do three things: My question is, do you follow these steps, and in this order, when developing great software? If not, what steps do you usually follow inorder to ensure it's well designed, well-coded, easy to maintain, reuse and extend?I disagree with #1 because most great software needs several major iterations to become truly great. The only other way to actually achieve #1 (on the first try) is to copy some other already-great software.  But to come up with something new and unique (like I did with ClipMate in 1991), you make your best effort, then release it to the world to see what customers have to say about it.  Through repeated cycles of re-assessing the product as a result of customer input and interaction, you eventually achieve great software.I've read this book.  I think there is some mis interpretation everywhere.


Firstly, make sure the software does everything the customer wants it to do

The book is saying to make sure you understand the customer requirements before starting a design.
Once step 1 is completed, apply Object Oriented principles and techniques to eliminate any duplicate code that might have slipped in

The book says to design with O-O principles
Once steps 1 and 2 are complete, then apply design patterns to make sure the software is maintainable and reusable for years to come.

Use design pattern.I'd normally start with an object-orientated design. It would have to be a pretty quick dirty/hack not to need #2 and #3. The trouble is, not to overdose on them.If I'm interpreting it correctly, it sounds a little ridgid. But perhaps the intent is correct - 1) can be paraphrased as ""stay focused"", in particular focusing on the business needs. That doesn't mean ignore all coding needs, but getting the balance right. There are many code changes and refactorings that no doubt improve the quality of the code, but these have to be weighted up against the time taken, risks, and delays caused to the project. As a developer, it's all too easy to (over)priorize code changes above business needs.

Applying OO principles later sounds impractical - if you haven't used OO principles, how was the software that does what the customer wants built in the first place? Perhaps it's hinting to continual refactoring, KISS, and reducing up-front design in favor of an iterative development cycle.

There is an element of truth in 3) - recognising patterns after the software is built and refactoring to isolate common repeated elements, but I think of this as a natrual consequence of an iterative development cycle.First and foremost great software must do everything the customer needs it to do and at least most of what the customer wants it to do.  These are not the same thing.  Also it is better to start off with something small and simple, and evolve it rather than trying to build everything in one ginormous app.  

As for the other two points, they seem a bit confused.  Avoiding duplication is a design principle, but only one of many.  Why single it out for special consideration?  Rather than (say) Programming to interfaces?  Or Tell don't ask?  Or Avoid broken windows? 

Hmmmm...

When I started typing this response I intended to say I don't think you can retrofit OO techniques or design patterns.  But having thought about it some more it has occured to me that this is not the case.  It is quite common in TDD practice for the initial implementation - the simplest thing which gets the code to pass the test - to be quite procedural.  But once the code passes its tests there is a cycle of refactoring which applies design patterns and produces a more objected-oriented implementation.Great Software is based on good design and clean programmation with approving design pattern ( MVC, process component..).Object orientation is not something you bolt on as an afterthought - you start with OO analysis and design and proceed to an OO implementation. I suspect you may have misread or misinterpreted the book. Similarly with design patterns - they are not add-ons.",,,,,1,737,60.57,21.08,47.49,46.93,19.92,23.61,83.85,66.35,53.19,10.85,3.93,1.9,0,1.63,0,0.41,6.92,13.7,6.92,3.12,13.3,8.55,4.75,7.46,1.63,17.23,6.24,4.34,1.76,0.14,1.36,0.27,17.5,1.09,16.28,3.26,2.31,2.71,3.26,0.54,4.75,0,3.12,2.44,0.68,0.27,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,5.83,2.85,0.14,0,0.14,0,2.31,2.99,0,0,0,0,1.76,0,0,1.76,4.48,0,0.14,4.34,1.22,0,0.27,0.14,0.14,0,0,0.14,0,0,0,2.04,0.54,0.41,0,0.27,0,0,0.68,0.14,4.88,7.19,1.36,1.76,3.93,0.14,0.27,0,4.88,1.63,6.51,2.44,0.14,0,0,0.14,0,18.18,5.7,4.48,1.09,0,1.63,5.29,
XML Editing/Viewing Software [closed],"What software is recommended for working with and editing large XML schemas?

Most good text editors will have decent syntax hi-lighting and tag matching facilities.  Your IDE might already do it (IntelliJ idea does, and I believe Eclipse does as well).

I do know some people who swear by XMLSpy, if you need something that's tailored specifically for dealing with XML files in a visual way.  I bet you could find some F/OSS work-alikse but I'm not aware of any.FirstObject XML Editor.  http://www.firstobject.com/dn_editor.htm

Its free, written in C++, optimized for working with very large xml files.  

While it is relatively limited in functionality, it can load 100MB+ unformatted files in seconds, indent them and locate specific elements using the tree view.  By using the 'Refresh' option you can also synchronise the tree with the text view.

It's in the UNIX spirit of having a simple tool doing a specific job very well.You need at least a decent text editor as a baseline, emacs with nxml mode as mentioned before is a very good choice. However as the schema becomes larger and larger you may lose the overview, especially when you author an XML Schema document which can be very verbose. You'll need some sort of visualization: XML Spy is ok, Oxygen is great but expensive, but as it turns out, on Windows, you have almost all needed features in XMLPad which is freeware.

When you start editing instance XML documents (and even editing XML Schemas) you need on the fly validation against a schema and if possible auto-completion of attributes and elements. Emacs only supports on the fly validation and auto-completion with a relax NG based schema (but any XSD can be converted to a relax NG schema).

If you have any choice in the matter, consider using Relax NG as your schema syntax, it is much more readable and maintainable.I work a lot with XML, and have found Oxygen to be a great editor.  It's cross-platform and has a graphical schema editor, but since I use DTDs and not schemas, I can't vouch for the schema editor's quality.  The rest of the editing package (such as the XML editor and XSLT debugger) is solid, so it could be worth a try.Altova's XMLSpy is probably the best available.  It offers different views of your data/schemas, XPath tools and produces good diagrams, among other things.  It does cost quite a bit though.  It's a mature product, so you don't tend to run into limitations as quickly as you do with some other tools.

Liquid XML is a pretty good, but relatively new alternative.  It's a nice app to use and  there's even a free version available!  This is a tool worth keeping an eye on.

Both of these products have a handy feature which produces sample XML files based on your schema.

In contrast, Oracle's JDeveloper (based on Borland Jbuilder, I believe) tries to provide a decent schema editor, but falls short in that it sometimes produces invalid schema files.  I stopped using it soon after noticing this.

I highly recommend checking out IBM's XML Schema Quality Checker.  This command line tool validates your schema against WC3's XML Schema language.  This is a good idea even if you've built your schema using another tool.I use nxml-mode in GNU Emacs for editing xml, including very big files. And i use it for a long time - it quick, provide on-the-fly validation of xml , and provide completion functionality for tag & attributes namesThe oXygen XML Editor a great IDE for Windows, bit expensive tho.Altova's XML Spy is a great editor, but not necesarily the cheapest option out there.I highly recommend Stylus Studio if you have any need for a long term broadly capable XML IDE. I've used it mostly for XSLT development but it supports development of almost everything XML related you would want to do. It's Windows only (very annoying).I am using Cooktop (also available on tucows), and I'm very happy about XPath testing feature.

Small download, small footprintOpen source XML editors examined - it is a little bit outdated though.+1 for XML Spy, I've used both the stand alone product and the visual studio plugin, and I've been impressed.

In terms of FOSS, I use Notepad++Recently I was editing XSLT files with Eclipse but for some reason Eclipse wouldn't do any auto-completion anymore. So I switched to Emacs's brilliant nxml-mode, and I'm not sure I'm going back. You get auto-completion that's really easy to use, and it's very fast. The only glitch is that you must provide a RELAX NG version of your document's schema, but there are tools out there that generate one for you from your DTD or Schema.

Check out http://www.xmlhack.com/read.php?item=2061 for more.

For non-free software, I second the recommendations for OxygenXML.I use Notepad++ as my editor.  You can also add plugins for dealing with XML specifically.XML Copy Editor - Windows and Linux

Fast, free, and supports XML schema validation.

"Xcode error connecting to simulator ""Software caused connection abort""","When I try to run my project through the Xcode simulator, it keeps giving me the error ""Software caused connection abort"". Tried restarting the simulator & Xcode, and I recently deleted the DerivedData folder as suggested in this post about broken playgrounds so that also didn't help.QUICK FIX

This is happening because you have multiple versions of Xcode installed. MacOS unfortunately only supports running one version of Xcode at a time, and it needs to know the location of the currently running version. To sort things out, choose one of the following: 

Quit all instances of Xcode and restart it

Try one of the other options below if that hasn't solved it.

Using the command line:


run   sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/your_custom_folder_if_needed/Xcode.app
Restart your terminal and Xcode and it will work just fine.


No-command line users:


Quit all instances of Xcode
Start the instance of Xcode that you want to use
Go to Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations
Select the correct version in Command Line Tools
Done!It's due to multiple Xcode installed in your system. This is how you make it work:


Quit all running Xcodes
Re-launch Xcode
Go to Xcode > Preferences > Locations
Change to the correct version in Command Line Tools


Clean project and clear Derived data if necessary, then run!In my case quitting and re-launching given Xcode was enough. I had two Xcodes, stable and beta.For me, restarting the Mac OS worked (multiple times).",,,,,1,243,70.48,22.75,77.17,38.04,30.38,23.87,77.78,60.91,44.44,11.11,5.35,2.88,0,2.47,0,0,5.76,13.99,5.76,1.65,11.52,4.12,3.7,7,0.82,15.64,5.76,4.53,6.17,0.41,4.53,1.23,13.58,1.23,12.35,2.88,2.88,2.88,1.65,0,4.53,0,2.06,1.65,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.94,2.06,0.41,0,0,0,0.41,2.47,0,0,0,0,0.82,0,0,0.82,2.47,0,0,2.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.23,0.41,0,0,0.41,0,0,0,0,5.35,8.64,0,3.29,6.17,0,0,0,5.35,4.53,3.29,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,20.99,4.53,2.88,0,0.82,1.23,11.52,
Xcode is not currently available from the Software Update server,"I have problems with my macport after update to OS X 10.9. I try to follow this manual https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration to fix them. But when I install Command Line Tools: xcode-select --install I get message Can't install the software because it is not currently available from 
  the Software Update server. Meanwhile I successfully updated my other machine to OS X 10.9. and installed command-line tools with no problems, so they must be available. What is the problem here?You can download the command line tools for OS X Mavericks manually from here:

https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=for%20XcodeFor OSX 10.11 or more you can download from here https://developer.apple.com/download/more/. 

(The link in the accepted answer doesn't display command line tools for El Capitan (OSX 10.11))If you are trying this on a latest Mac OS X Mavericks, command line tools come with the Xcode 5.x
So make sure you have installed & updated Xcode to latest
after which make sure Xcode command line tools is pointed correctly using this command
xcode-select -p

Which might show some path like

/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

Change the path to correct path using the switch command:
sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/

this should help you set it to correct path, after which you can use the same above command  -p to check if it is set correctlyI faced same problem of Can't install the software because it is currently not available from the Software Update Server. You may try following steps instead to make the Software Update initiate update for the Command Line Tools.

Check if Command Line Tools Update is mentioned in your list of softwares to be updated by using following command: softwareupdate -l
If Command Line Tools Update is not mentioned in that list, then manually make it part of the list using following command which will create a temporary file: sudo touch /tmp/.com.apple.dt.CommandLineTools.installondemand.in-progress
Verify that the list now has the Command Line Tools mentioned by running softwareupdate -l again.
Now, press Cmd+Space to initiate Mac's Spotlight Search. Search for Software Update. Start the Software Update.
That will show you following kind of dialog for installing the Command Line Tools. Install away the update and be merry. :)

Remove the temporary file created in Step 2: sudo rm /tmp/.com.apple.dt.CommandLineTools.installondemand.in-progress.I deleted the command tools directory given by xcode-select -p due to npm gyp error.
xcode-select failed to install the files with the not available error.
I ran the Xcode application and the command tools installed as part of the startup.
npm worked.
However this didn't fully fix the tools. I had to use xcode-select to switch the path to the Developer directory within the Xcode application directory.
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer  

MacOS catalina.I just got the same error after I upgraded to 10.14 Mojave and had to reinstall command line tools (I don't use the full Xcode IDE and wanted command line tools a la carte).
My xcode-select -p path was right, per Basav's answer, so that wasn't the issue.
I also ran sudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog per Lambda W's answer and that reset to Apple Production, but did not make a difference.
What worked was User 92's answer to visit https://developer.apple.com/download/more/.
From there I was able to download a .dmg file that had a GUI installer wizard for command line tools :)
I installed that, then I restarted terminal and everything was back to normal.I know this is an old post but I also ran into this problem today. I found out that when I executed sudo softwareupdate -l the Command Line Tools were listed as an update, so I installed them using sudo softwareupdate -i -a.This error can occur if you are using a software update server which doesn't host the required package.

You can check this by running

defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate


and seeing if you have an entry called CatalogURL or AppleCatalogURL

You can point back at the Apple software update server by either removing this entry or using the command

sudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog


And then run the command line tools install again.I got the same issue on MacOS Catalina.
I think I identified the root cause: I have switched the default Apple ID account and the new one was not activated as a Developer account. When I ran the xcode-select --install command, I got the same error as stated in the issue description.
After reading this post on stackoverflow, I went on https://developer.apple.com/downloads and I was asked to accept Developers terms. I think it enabled my account as a developer one. Then, I tried to run  xcode-select --install again and it worked.The command


  xcode-select --install


proposes 3 options: Get Xcode; Not Now; Install.

When I choose to get full Xcode the command finished successfully. It took a while, but this way I was able to complete all macports migration instructions.Once you get the command line tools loaded as described by Nikos M in his excellent answer above you will need to agree to the gcc license and if you are using ruby gems you may need to link llvm-gcc as gcc-4.2.  

If you do not do these the gem install will report ""You have to install development tools first."" after you have already installed them.

The steps are:

sudo gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/llvm-gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.2


The gcc must be run once under sudo so Apple can update their license info, you don't need an input file, it will update the license before it checks its arguments.  The link is needed so that ruby 1.9 can find the compiler when building certain gems, such as the debugger.  This may be fixed in ruby 2.x, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.I had to run Xcode.app and agree to the License Agreement

Setup: Brand new MacBook with Mavericks, then brew install and other c/l type things 'just work'.I solved this by going to the App Store and installing Xcode.
It was a pretty large 11GB install, so this is probably overkill. But, as a last resort, it seems to have solve my issues. In the middle of the installation (well around 10GB), Mac OS told me there was an update to Command Line Tools for Xcode. Performing this installation won't fix anything until Xcode is fully installed.
Once the install is done, it should start working (after you accept the license agreement).Command + Space

Search for Xcode

Open it and accept license

Then run again from terminal xcode-select --installHad the same issue and was getting the same error. When i ran xcode-select -p, it gave output as /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools. So that means xcode was already installed in my system. Then i ran steps as given on this answer.

			It sounds very much like you dont have permission in the admin CP to do everything you need to do. 
		
	



	I see that. Isn't there a way to grant myself all those permissions? I do have two admin accounts. In WP, they are keymasters so they can do everything.It wouldnt matter what they are in wordpress. They would need to be administrators with all access on the invision platform. If you dont have those permissions, you would not be able to give yourself them (otherwise granting permissions would be of little use). If you have all permissions on one and not the other, then you can go to System>Staff>Administrators and correct the appropriate account/group there.



	If this has only been happening since logging in with SSO however, its likely you are simply being logged in with the wrong user. An admin on wordpress will not automatically have access on invision, unless its mapped to an account on invision with those rightsThanks @Marc Stridgen I'll look further into this.

	In our Client Area access details, the number password dots after you save will be different than the characters in your password. I would advise simply copying/pasting the password in, after verifying it is correct on your own login, so you know it is correct.I am running a bit in circles with a situation.


	I created an account when I installed Invision for my site. The name was MyC**** and the email was admin@scr*********. I also installed Wordpress SSO. Now, I might have messed up something because my admin account on my site is Cassel (as display name) but MyC**** as username, and the email is cassel@cr********.


	Now, if I log into my site, normally, as the Cassel admin, when I go to the Invision AdminCP, it switched to the MyC**** with the admin@scr****** account. 


	Now, I am trying to streamline things, but it is not working as expected. I have a Loom recording of what is happening when I try to change the details but I don't want to post it in the open forum so let me describe it:



	I was able to change the email address to the MyC*** account from admin@scr******* to cassel@cr******* (you can see at the bottom)



	


	However, for the Cassel account, the email is cassel@cr****** and even if I try to change it to admin@cr***** (to make it different than the M account), it always reverts to this, even if, in the member activity it shows that it was changed.



	


	I tried logging out completely and come back, and the email is still cassel@cr*****



	Can you help me straighten this out?You would need to work with your SSO’s author as you may be fighting an uphill battle depending on how these accounts are tied to the WordPress versions. If it updates the email address on login, it will change each time you login if it is configured to do that. Seeing as we do not know how the SSO functions, we cannot answer how to resolve this.I thought it might have something to do with the accounts directly inside Invision first.

	When the diff is 1 day 30 minutes for instance, it would return -1 year, +11 months, +29 days, +23 hours, +30 minutes.



	This issue caused the online indicator on our site to stop function, as the diff wasn't ""just 15 minutes"". $diff->y would for instance not be TRUE ,as it's -1.

	Fixed that issue by changing this in Member::isOnline()


$diff = \IPS\DateTime::ts( $this->last_activity, TRUE )->diff( \IPS\DateTime::create() );


	Wonder is this is just an issue for those in a + timezone (only speculations)

	As you can see, -48 days since it expired when you don't bypass timezones. You are comparing a unix timestamp with another unix timestamp, so you shouldn't adjust for timezones anyway.This really needs to be looked at in the ticket that was created. The ticket was closed because a fix was manually added. Please revert the changes entirely, and I can then reopen that ticket and add these details.On 9/9/2022 at 4:53 AM,   Marc Stridgen said:

	How do I reopen that ticket then? Can't you just open that ticket yourselve? You see - I have an issue with emails coming from your supportsystem are not received on my mailserver and I do not like using so much time with this issue as long as the error is found.I feel you may have misunderstood what I said above. You need the issue to be reverted, and then ""I"" can reopen that ticket. 


	I understand you are having issues with emails, however your other email address was added to that, and you should add that as an alternative contact. I cannot escalate your ticket and get you a resolution if you cannot recieve the emails

	I will catch up with you on that topic shortlyHi there. Is there nothing I can check myself? I very much appreciate that getting access to people's dashboard is a much more preferable way of dealing with things for you guys, but I've had a lot of poor and bad experience with people accessing my backend :-) including someone replacing my htaccess file with a bog standard basic one and deleting over 40 of my redirects and various other customisations. There are other incidents that I won't bore you with too. I hasten to add that this was not you guys. But I just prefer not to let people have a direct look until at least the basics have been checked.



	As reported last week, I had disabled the, ""Invision Community License expires or will expire soon"" notification in my dashboard. I have just tried re-enabling it, and received 2 more, ""Your Invision Community License"" expiry notifications within less than a minute.



	Just to confirm, my licence does not expire while 22 November. Plus, I have run Invision forums for over 10 years, and to my recollection they never send me these emails because it just gets automatically paid by direct debit.Just had another one 14 minutes later. I will need to turn off the notifications in my control panel again to stop them. However, it is frustrating that something like this would suddenly start to happen, and with no explanation.",,,,,1,1530,43.18,31.65,64.26,22.68,25.5,18.82,83.14,61.37,48.37,13.59,8.3,4.31,0.98,2.48,0,0.52,5.29,11.9,4.31,8.37,11.7,8.76,4.9,5.62,1.96,15.69,5.03,4.84,2.61,1.37,0.52,0.72,13.07,0.59,12.29,1.96,2.29,2.22,1.05,0.78,3.79,0.07,1.5,0.85,0.65,0.59,0.2,0.39,0,0.13,0.2,0,10.2,5.23,1.31,0.98,0.07,0.13,3.59,5.1,0,0,0,0.13,1.7,0.07,0,1.63,1.24,0,0,1.05,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,0,0.85,0,0,0,0,0.07,0.39,5.23,5.49,0.72,0.65,3.53,0.98,0,0.07,8.1,5.29,4.64,0.72,0.52,0.46,0.07,0,0,49.02,5.16,7.25,0.72,0.26,9.67,25.95,

agile software development process metrics [closed],"I'm interested in where to find information about agile software engineering development process metrics, what kind of variables are assessed to evaluate such processes? I'm interested in productivity, timeliness, staff utilization, and quality.

I'm building an agent-based simulation to model an agile software development process and I'm trying to find real world data to see if my model is predicting things correctly. To be more specific, does productivity (and staff utilization) follow an oscillating pattern over time throughout a software process?

Thanks!Measurement is often very tricky and one should always keep the following quote in mind:

""Tell me how [and when] you’ll measure me, and I’ll tell you how I’ll behave."" -- Eliyahu M. Goldratt

This doesn't mean measurement is impossible, it just means you have to do it in a really smart way and, actually, I especially like the system that Mary Poppendieck recommends. This system is based on three holistic measurements that must be taken as a package:

Cycle time
From product concept to first release or
From feature request to feature deployment or
From bug detection to resolution
Business Case Realization (without this, everything else is irrelevant)
P&L or
ROI or
Goal of investment

concerns of software architecture,"I am doing a report on Software Architecture and one of the sections which i need to write about is the issues that arise when using Software Architecture. I have tried to look online, read books etc but i can’t find anything to do with what the problems that will rise when using Software Architecture. Any help on where i might be able to find anything would be great. Thanks in advance Have a read through Code Complete. It covers lots of relevant topics. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post. Closed 4 years ago. Reading the reviews at Amazon and ACCU suggests that John Lakos' book, Large-Scale C++ Software Design may be the Rosetta Stone for modularization. At the same time, the book seems to be really rare: not many have ever read it, and no pirate electronic copies are floating around. So, what do you think? I've read it, and consider it a very useful book on some practical issues with large C++ projects.  If you have already read a lot about C++, and know a bit about physical design and its implications, you may not find that much which is terribly ""new"" in this book.

On the other hand, if your build takes 4 hours, and you don't know how to whittle it down, get a copy, read it, and take it all in.

You'll start writing physically better code quite quickly.

[Edit]
If you want to start somewhere, and can't immediately get a hold of the book, I found the Games From Within series on physical structure useful even after reading Large Scale C++ design. Interestingly, ""More C++ Gems"" contains a shortened (to 88(!) pages) version of Lakos' book, which can also be browsed (fully, I believe, as it belongs to the first half of the book) online at Google books. 

So, enjoy everyone interested:) Lakos used to work for Mentor Graphics, who makes EDA software. He was involved in building EDA software in C++, where they wanted to use C++ efficiently ('no more than 5% overhead over C code') and sort out how to build software on early workstations that really would take a long time to compile a large C++ application.

The book is quite a good read - it discusses a wide variety of topics, and Lakos really did know his stuff. He really comes from a background of having to get efficient code out of a C++ compiler, as well as how to set up a C++ program so it is maintainable and compiles and links reasonably quickly.

I think that Lakos has a lot of insight, and I would recommend that you read it. However, it is 'trad' C++ from a time before features like templates were widely available. My copy is not for sale ;^) I thought the book was a good read back in the late 1990s. It was out of date back then, now about as relevant as telephone book from the 1950s.

I worked with Lakos for several years where he tried to implement these ideas. I also had my modern C++ project I built of about 2000 source files-- large scale enough, and I've built a few more since. Build times are easily reduced by parallel distributed builds, using programs like icecream. Every complier will cache opened headers-- only by doing something really outrageous any modern build tool like scons will scale to thousands of translation units without doing anything really special, with build times, including tests, takes a couple minutes from clean.

Limiting your libraries interface to a few ""vocabulary types"" (not the same sence as the OO concept, he means just use Int, float, string, char, and a couple of other I don't recall) is extremely poor advice to scale anything. Your build is going to be looking for a type mismatch, you don't want this at runtime just to make it easier to write a make file. 

And that's largely the gist of the book-- how do I write C++ in order that it works with tools from 1993? Additionally, the Mentor Graphic project the book describes was a disaster from all accounts. Even the book itself alludes to that.

Large Scale C++ is delivered in source code form-- these are the ""physical dependencies,"" not link libraries (and the book never mentions other more important dependencies like databases, sockets, processor architecture, etc.). It's a little out of date (in fact it was out of date when it was written). If I recall correctly, a lot of it was about reducing dependencies which you would probably do now with templates.

Although that's probably one of the lessons to learn on large scale projects, you aren't usually using cutting-edge features and tools.

The book is full of ideas that sound good, but there are much better ways to scale up in practice. If you want to study large C++ libraries, take a look at Boost or Xerces and see what they did. They really are implementing large projects, not writing about them. Is “Large-Scale C++ Software Design” by John Lakos a mind-provoking (but usually overlooked) gem?

Yes. It is an excellent book and an important one from a historical point of view.

Note that to implement the practices described in the book, you need considerable discipline and agreement within the team. Here are a few things to note:


Lakos has precise definitions for what he calls ""components"" and ""packages"". These are key for large scale design. However, they require adherence to conventions for how source and header files are named and the sequence in which they are included. It is a shame that most people (including those who quote Lakos) rarely follow these conventions.
The book is all about C++ but the concepts are more widely applicable. However, because C++ is such a complex language, a large part of the book is teaching you how to use C++ effectively. If you can get past that, you can actually find it useful even if you use other languages.
Some of the prescriptions such as on the use of ""name spaces"" maybe considered controversial now. Many believe that name spaces should be used in a limited way in C++. Yes, in some ways, the book is a little dated and some of it is C++ specific. Nonetheless, it offers a lot of useful advice about dealing with complexity and coupling in large programs, and most of his advice applies to any object-oriented language. I also found it very readable.

If you can track down a copy, I'm sure you'll find it worth reading. It's in my top ten list of programming books.I read it a long time ago, but I remember getting quite a lot from it; though as MadKeithV points out, that may just have been that I knew less then ;)

Certainly from a ""how do I reduce how long this takes to build"" perspective it's has lots of useful stuff, especially around reducing compile time dependencies, though possibly some of it is no longer relevant, or even possible, given how much templates are used these days.

And no, you can't have my copy either :)",,,,,1,1205,52.15,25.73,43.81,50.84,19.75,17.93,85.81,71.7,56.18,12.12,5.39,2.32,0,1.83,0.58,0.5,6.72,14.44,6.72,1.16,13.78,8.55,7.8,6.39,1.49,16.6,7.14,7.88,1.83,0.41,1.24,0.33,16.51,1.08,15.27,4.32,2.9,1.66,3.07,0.91,4.07,0.25,2.66,2.32,0.33,0.75,0.58,0.17,0,0,0,0,6.56,3.24,0.5,0.08,0,0.58,1.74,3.4,0,0,0,0.58,1.08,0,0,1.08,5.15,0.08,0,4.9,0.25,0,0.5,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.41,0.41,1,0,0.33,0,0,0,0.58,6.39,6.47,0.66,0.33,4.73,0.66,0.08,0,3.73,3.24,5.39,0.91,0.41,0.25,0.17,0,0,20.83,4.73,5.39,0.33,0.08,1.91,8.38,
deploying custom software on linux?,"What are the best methods of deploying this type of software to linux machine? Currently, we use svn export, are there any other methods?We use checkinstall. Just write a simple Makefile that copies the files to target directories on the target machine and then run checkinstall to create RPM, DEB or TGZ package, which you can later easily install with distribution package management tools. 

You can even add shell scripts that are executed before and after files are copied, so you can do some pre and post processing like adding user accounts, crontab entries, etc.

Once you get more advanced, you can add dependencies to these packages so it could also pull and install PHP, MySQL, Apache, GCC libraries and even required PHP or Apache modules or some extenal C++ libs you might need, all with a single command.I think it depends on what you mean by deploy.  Typically a deploy process for web projects involves a configuration scripting step in which you can take the same deploy package and cater it to specific servers (staging, development, production) by altering simple configuration directives.  

In my experience with Linux serviers, these systems are often custom built, and in my experience often use rsync rather than svn export and/or scp alone.

A script might be executed from the command line like so:

$ deploy-site --package=app \
--platform=dev \
--title=""Revsion 1.2""


Internally, the system would take whatever was in trunk for the given package from SVN (I'm sure you could adapt this really easily for git too), generate a new unique tag with the log entry ""deploying Revision 1.2"". 

Then it would patch any configuration scripts with the appropriate changes (urls, hosts, database passwords, etc.) before rsyncing it the appropriate destination.

If there are issues with the deployment, it's as easy as running the same command again only this time using one of your auto-generated tags from an earlier deploy:

$ deploy-site --package=app \
--platform=dev \
--title=""Reverting to Revision 1.1"" \
--tag=20090714200154


If you have to also do a compile on the other end, you could include as part of your configuration patching a Makefile and then execute a command via ssh that would compile the recently deployed code once the rsync process completes.I write company internal software in PHP and C++.",,,,,1,383,60.49,55.63,9.72,23.53,34.82,25.33,69.71,57.7,47.52,10.18,5.22,1.31,0.52,3.39,0,0,4.96,12.79,6.53,2.09,11.23,6.79,5.74,8.09,0,13.84,4.96,3.13,3.13,0.52,0.52,2.09,13.32,0.26,13.05,0.26,2.09,3.13,3.66,0.26,3.92,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.01,1.57,0,0,0,0,0.52,3.92,0,0,0,0.26,2.87,0,0,2.87,3.13,0,0,3.13,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.04,0,0.78,0,0.26,0,0,0,0.78,3.13,3.92,0,1.04,2.87,0,0,0,4.7,1.04,4.44,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,24.02,3.92,6.01,0.52,0,0.52,13.05,

				You are probably using an ACP custom theme. You can try this if you have access to your php myadmin in your server. 
			

			
				1. Open the core_themes table 
			

			
				2. Write down the ID number of the theme by default, IPS (from set_id column) 
			

			
				3. Open the core_members table, on your profile row in the skin column, change the theme number to the theme number that I wrote you to remember above. Save it. 
			

			
				4. Delete cookies and cache from your browser and then load your site and login. Try and log in to ACP, then clear site cache.5 hours ago,   Qeria said:

iTunes software service authentication error domain error 434,"I am uploading iPhone application using latest xCode 8. I have good internet connection and all the relevant settings set up at iTunes connect. My distribution profiles are also set up correctly. I am facing below error:- iTunes software service authentication error domain error 434So this has what worked for me:

Preface: 
4 days of debugging, recreated certificates numerous times, nothing worked, every time i try to validate/upload via Xcode it says same error ""iTunes software service authentication error domain error 434""

Solution without XCode:


Create archive in Xcode
Export IPA in Organiser (Xcode > window > Organiser)
Open Application Loader and manually choose IPA generated
Done


Solution with XCode:


Create archive in Xcode
Click Validate
Unselect BitCode
Check if its validated, mine got validated when i unchecked bitcode
Not Try to genrate similar fashion with Bitcode unselected
If all goes fine now generate with Bitcode Checked(mine worked with these exact steps)
DoneThis is a very common error while uploading a build to iTunes Connect.
A simple answer to it : ""Just RETRY"".To resolve this error follow these methods.


If you have not added app icons add them and try archiving.
Remove developer account and add account again. Press CMD + , to bring up preferences in Xcode and from accounts remove and add back account. Try archiving this. 
Clean project (CMD + Shift + K), close Xcode, restart Xcode and
build project (CMD + B). Check for warnings. ( if you are using
cocapods some times Xcode asks you to change project settings in
warning. Click on warning and fix it. Xcode fixes it automatically)
Simply retry archiving.


ToDo. Add More solutionsIn my case the problem was the virus protection software I am using. I turned it off before attempting validation and everything went fine.This could be the problem of Xcode. You can try two different approaches here. 

i) Use Application loader, Download it. 
ii) Before using Application Loader please un-install all certificate and upload the ipa file. If it fails via app loader. 

then second approach we can use try to upgrade the version of Xcode. Either de-grade it (xcode 7.X) or upgrade it (8.X) some time with some specific version of xcode and and specific version of OS system throw such error. 
Try using those hopefully second one can help you to upload the app.Change the network connection and application submit via Application LoaderDid you set the device to Generic iOS Device before you archived the build? That appears to have fixed it for me on a couple of different occasions.I got exactly the same error response, read a bunch of posts like this that were uncertain of cause & solution, tried to validate it again with zero changes, and it validated successfully. Go figure...I had this same issue, but it turned out I used a different profile in the Xcode project, then when I tried to validate the app. It wasn't noticeable since at my company we use multiple Apple id's under the same businessname. Maybe checking this helps?None of the solutions here worked for me but I was able to solve these errors executing the application on the device that is connected to the computer before archiving it. I tried to archive it again and the validate process was passed.None of the answers worked for me. Following steps helped me fix it.


Quit the Xcode
Delete all provisioning profiles (/Library/MobileDevice)
Start the code and try to validate without download the provisioning profiles.


The xcode will download the profiles for you.In my case I had 2 builds in the same app and when I tried to verify one of them it started giving the same error. I removed both builds and re archive. It worked fine after that.In my case, I have checked iOS provisioning profile from developer website and found the one related to my app was invalid. 

I have regenerated (all invalid) provisioning profiles and download it from xCode -> preferences -> accounts. This resolves my case.I have a different solution. I had ""Enable Bitcode"" set as false in my target settings but had ""Include bitcode"" checked as true for the validation. For obvious reasons, the validation would fail every time if I had include bitcode checked. I unchecked include bitcode and it worked just fine after cleaning my project.",,,,,1,719,66.37,8.68,57.72,38.32,18.44,25.45,76.5,58.41,44.92,12.93,7.09,5.42,0.28,1.11,0,0.28,5.84,12.1,5.15,1.81,11.68,4.59,2.78,6.68,0.83,13.77,4.31,4.17,5.84,0.7,4.87,0.28,14.6,1.81,12.8,2.64,2.64,2.23,1.53,0.42,4.17,0,2.09,1.67,0.42,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,4.59,2.09,0.56,0.14,0,0,1.25,1.67,0,0,0,0,3.06,0,0,3.06,5.56,0.56,0.14,4.87,0.83,0,0.14,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.83,0,0,0,0.14,0.56,0.28,3.62,6.82,1.25,1.67,3.76,0.28,0,0,3.76,5.01,2.36,0.28,0.14,0.14,0.14,0,0,16.83,7.09,2.09,0.28,0,0.28,7.09,

java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: recv failed [duplicate],"I haven't been able to find an adequate answer to what exactly the following error means: java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: recv failed Notes: Relevant code:This usually means that there was a network error, such as a TCP timeout. I would start by placing a sniffer (wireshark) on the connection to see if you can see any problems.  If there is a TCP error, you should be able to see it.  Also, you can check your router logs, if this is applicable.  If wireless is involved anywhere, that is another source for these kind of errors.This also happens if your TLS client is unable to be authenticate by the server configured to require client authentication.This error occurs when a connection is closed abruptly (when a TCP connection is reset while there is still data in the send buffer). The condition is very similar to a much more common 'Connection reset by peer'. It can happen sporadically when connecting over the Internet, but also systematically if the timing is right (e.g. with keep-alive connections on localhost).

An HTTP client should just re-open the connection and retry the request. It is important to understand that when a connection is in this state, there is no way out of it other than to close it. Any attempt to send or receive will produce the same error.

Don't use URL.open(), use Apache-Commons HttpClient which has a retry mechanism, connection pooling, keep-alive and many other features.

Sample usage:

HttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.custom()
            .setConnectionTimeToLive(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            .setMaxConnTotal(400).setMaxConnPerRoute(400)
            .setDefaultRequestConfig(RequestConfig.custom()
                    .setSocketTimeout(30000).setConnectTimeout(5000).build())
            .setRetryHandler(new DefaultHttpRequestRetryHandler(5, true))
            .build();
// the httpClient should be re-used because it is pooled and thread-safe.

HttpGet request = new HttpGet(uri);
HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(request);
reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(response.getEntity().getContent()));
// handle response ...Are you accessing http data?  Can you use the HttpClient library instead of the standard library?  The library has more options and will provide better error messages.

http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/The only time I've seen something like this happen is when I have a bad connection, or when somebody is closing the socket that I am using from a different thread context.Try adding 'autoReconnect=true' to the jdbc connection stringThis will happen from time to time either when a connection times out or when a remote host terminates their connection (closed application, computer shutdown, etc). You can avoid this by managing sockets yourself and handling disconnections in your application via its communications protocol and then calling shutdownInput and shutdownOutput to clear up the session.Look if you have another service or program running on the http port. It happened to me when I tried to use the port and it was taken by another program.If you are using Netbeans to manage Tomcat, try to disable HTTP monitor in Tools - ServersI too had this problem. My solution was:

sc.setSoLinger(true, 10);


COPY FROM A WEBSITE -->By using the setSoLinger() method, you can explicitly set a delay before a reset is sent, giving more time for data to be read or send.

mac version control software?,"anyone know any good mac version control software? if so why is do you reccomend it, dont mind paying a little money for the software edit: thanks everyone for the information so its come down to Mercurial vs SubVersionsapp (SVN)We use SVN (mac client) at work from all different platforms.  Git (mac client) or Mercurial (mac client) would work as well.  Personally, I wouldn't pay for something like this unless you're using an IDE that has integrated SCM as part of it's paid offering.  This is an area where the free/open source solutions have actually been preferable to paid solutions for many years.  If you don't feel comfortable supporting it (maintaining the repository, backups, etc.), you might want to look at a hosting service for the repository.Check out http://versionsapp.com/ for an SVN client

Maybe a future version of Xcode will support more version control systems.If you go for Mercurial (which I personally recommend) or Git you should take a look at SourceTree as a very Mac-like client software.

managing software editions,"I plan to create 3 editions of a piece of software in Java from existing code base. What's the best practice?  should I create 3 different projects one for each edition?  Also any tools for managing editions?My first thought would be to keep a single codebase if at all possible and use some kind of flag for switching.

If not possible, I'd try to keep as much as possible the same and have the larger project use the smaller project as a sub-project, If possible automatically enabling some features--for instance, each of the projects could have it's own main, the different builds may just call the different mains which set flags to enable features.  

If your flags are final, it should even avoid pulling unnecessary code into your project at all.

Finally, worst case, 3 branches in Subversion.

Edit:

You made me think a bit more on this and I think I found a better solution.

I think I'd separate this into four projects, combining all the ""common"" stuff into a base project and the stuff that is different, I'd spread out to the other three projects--so let's say you have base, demo, pay and business projects..

Where the three might differ, you would have an object from one of the demo/pay/business classes provide the functionality.  For instance, if the pay version has new menu items, you might have a getMenuItems in one of your objects.  It would return a menu tree that you could place in your menu bar.  The demo version would have less items.

In this way your ""Base"" never knows which version it's running, it just uses objects.

To get the objects, I'd have a factory.  The factory would look something like this:

private String[] availablePackages={""business"", ""pay"", ""demo""};

public getMenuClass() {
    Class c;
    for(String package : availablePackages) {
        try {
            c=Class.forName(""com.meh.myapp.""+package+"".MenuClass"");
        } catch... {
            // No package by that name
        }
        if(c != null) {
            return c.newInstance();
        }
    }
    // Something went wrong, no instance found.


The updraft is that you should try to instantiate com.meh.myapp.business.MenuClass first, then try ...pay.MenuClass finally ...demo.MenuClass.

This should allow you change your configuration by simply shipping different jars--If you decide to only ship the demo and main jars, you'll get a demo app.  By shipping the pay jar you'll get the pay app.

Note that it's pretty likely that you'll want business to delegate much of it's work to ""pay"", and ""pay"" to delegate a bunch of it's work to ""demo"", but demo knows NOTHING of business or pay, and ""main"" only knows of the other three reflectively.

This would be a nice solution because there is no configuration required--in fact, you'd only have to ship the pay jar to upgrade from demo to pay, the main and demo jars are reused and stay right where they are.The ideal way would be dividing your app into ""core"", ""additional stuff"", ""more additional stuff"" and combine these dependencies. This would probably be a lot of work depending on the code base you have, though.

If you use SVN for source code management, you can create 3 branches for each edition from the existing code base. Generally people try to avoid that because e.g. if you need to fix a common bug across these branches, you will need to fix that one in one of the branches and then merge that to the remaining branches. Maybe other source repositories handle that kind of situations better, but for SVN, I guess this is the only way.  

As for managing versions, we use maven. If you take the ""core"", ""additional stuff"", ""more additional stuff"" approach, maven can help because it can track the version of each component pretty cleanly (using pom).

	There are multiple levels of caching, if it isn't your browser, there is also server caching and caching in our application.



	It may be you have caching on your server which presented this and restarting it cleared that. Unfortunately, that would need to be something you contact your hosting provider on. Restarting the server shouldn't have an impact on the cache written to our datastore as this is not stored in your server's memory thus restarting it wouldn't have an impact.",,,,,1,214,18.25,20.76,31.22,26.33,26.75,18.69,79.44,64.95,53.27,17.76,7.48,3.74,0.93,2.8,0,0,10.28,13.08,2.8,7.01,11.68,11.21,3.27,7.01,3.74,19.16,3.74,1.4,2.8,0.93,0.93,0.93,15.42,1.87,13.55,2.8,1.87,2.8,2.34,0,3.74,0.47,2.34,1.4,0.93,0.47,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,6.54,2.8,0,0.93,0,0,2.8,3.74,0,0,0,0,0.47,0,0,0.47,0.47,0,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.48,7.48,0.93,0.93,4.21,2.34,0,0,2.8,4.67,7.01,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,17.29,4.21,3.74,0,0,3.74,5.61,

	they said the mysql processing causing the problem , and that's why it's too much slow, so i need to contact website developer to optimize the database.What kind of mysql issue exactly? Did they provide a list of slow queries or similar perhaps?You would need more information from your hosting company on this. As mentioned above, we need to know what is meant by mysql issue. Looking at your system, I am seeing nothing from a software point of view. 



	It is worth noting that you have quite a few 3rd party applications installed. While they may well not be the cause, it would be sensible to rule those out first of all, by disabling them and testing where you are seeing it to be running slowly. The same would apply to cloudflare. You should remove that from the situation entirely.

	why it is very very slow, its because of the server ? or because of the software ? because my hosting team said its some thing issue with website so i have to work with my web developersIt may be related to the INNODB tables, which is something you need to resolve. However given that even opening the login screen for the admin cp (its doing very very little there) is slow, I suspect its actually server related.

	i want to know one thing, i convert all my all database table that's was MYISAM to InnoDB but i see below its saying 



	MyISAM is the default storage engine of this mysql server 



	


	is this some thing i have to change also or its fine ?That's something your hosting needs to change in the MySQL configuration file.



	 



	Instead I see a different issue in your screenshot: you have a mix of utf8 and utf8mb4 tables. You should convert them all to utf8mb4.There isnt much I can add to the above.

	New themes is nice.Unfortunately, if your software is based in /forums, we do not provide any external redirect or anything of that nature so you would need to investigate how this was done.how complex is it to move from/forums to the root?It's pretty simple.

powershell remove software from PC,"I have following code which works perfectly. The only problem is that I wont to know if the software has been removed or not.This doesn't tells me but the code below does. This way works for me. my question is that how do i tell if the software has been removed or not.
using this code.You have to check the ReturnValue property. When you pipe to Out-Null you are suppressing the output of the operation and there's no way to tell what happened, unless you issue a second call to find if it returns the software in question.

I recommend using the Filter parameter (instead of using Where-Object) to query the software on the server. To be safe you should also pipe the results to the Foreach-Object cmdlet, you never know how many software objects you get back due to the match operation (and you call the Uninstall method as if the result is one object only):

Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product -ComputerName $PCNumber -Filter ""Name LIKE '%$softwareName%'"" | Foreach-Object {

record_publish_date not being populated,"My editor has started noticing a strange problem that did not exist previously. For each of the last few weeks, whenever he publishes an article, it does not appear at the top of the list of articles, instead, it is at the end. This happens regardless of whether he is writing the article directly into the CMS or is copying or promoting from a topic



	Through a process of elimination, we have determined that ALL affected articles have the same issue. The entry for each article in the DB has a record_saved field with the date but the field in the database called record_publish_date always shows 0. If I manually copy the record saved date to the other field it displays as intended but if i create an article and just save it, the database entry shows 0 and its nowhere to be seen on front page. 



	 



	



	 



	thought perhaps there may be an issue with using 'immediately' as a setting for publish, but created a second test article and used the date instead and still record_publish_date is 0.

rmon probe example software,"I've been struggling with such a problem - im tasked with writing an app for monitoring nodes in network using RMON. As far as I know, RMON is kind of extension to SNMP which provides additional data with usage of modified MIBs. I imagine realizing this task by writing a python app which periodically asks nodes in the net for specified OID and stores it in some SQL database. Furthermore, I've been thinking of some web application which takes data from that database and present it as a chart on some website. That's it, and now I'm not sure if I uderstand idea of RMON correctly? I couldn't find example software for RMON probe software in the Internet. Do I need just install SNMP simulator and ask for OID specified in RMON? Or I've been missearching? Can you recommend any (free) software which can be asked with rmon protocol? Thanks in advance for your help!The sample simulated SNMP agents that are shipped in the Free MIMIC SNMP Simulator contain RMON MIBs and sample tables.

run software even without windows [closed],"is there any way to make a software , so if the user reinstall windows or format disk drive , the software will run without installing automatically . I do not mean a software that do not require installation . think a user install this software , this software automatically run . one day user format hard disk and install a new windows . that software run automatically without installing .Theoretically yes, but the question to ask is, ""where is the executable for this program stored?""

Normally programs are stored on the hard disk, so if the user formats it, the program is gone[*]. So the question is, ""where else can code be stored?""

The answer is that, in theory, you can replace the machine's BIOS. This is a very abnormal thing to do, though, it requires all the admin privileges in the world, and the BIOS program can't be very big.

It also can't be written in C# or C++ in the usual Windows-y ways. Firstly the BIOS runs before Windows is running, that's the point. Secondly removing the OS removes the libraries that Windows programs rely on, so if the system drive has been formatted and Windows not re-installed, there's no way to launch Windows and hence no way to start your Windows program.

[*] Boot sector viruses are way out of fashion.If the user formats his hard drive and powers off his computer, there is no software left on the system that could be run.

No, this cannot be done (unless you re-flash the BIOS).You can make it portable. Thus you can copy executable on non-system partition and it will still work.

But I dont think there is any way to register this application in fresh windows instalation without modifying the instalation process itself.

software Interrupt vs software exception [duplicate],"Possible Duplicate:

  Interrupts and exceptions Can anybody explain what is the difference between software interrupt and software exception? Interrupt: means time slice expires, call instruction strikes exception: means access voilation, I am right or can anybody explain in depth ?A software interrupt occurs when the processor executes an INT instruction.  Written in the program, typically used to invoke a system service.

A processor interrupt is caused by an electrical signal on a processor pin.  Typically used by devices to tell a driver that they require attention.  The clock tick interrupt is very common, it wakes up the processor from a halt state and allows the scheduler to pick other work to perform.

A processor fault like access violation is triggered by the processor itself when it encounters a condition that prevents it from executing code.  Typically when it tries to read or write from unmapped memory or encounters an invalid instruction.",,,,,1,151,89.52,19.78,29.99,20.23,18.88,35.76,82.12,58.94,45.03,7.95,1.32,0.66,0,0,0,0.66,6.62,13.91,11.92,0,11.26,4.64,4.64,5.96,0,15.89,1.99,1.32,3.31,0,1.32,1.99,17.22,0,17.22,2.65,3.31,1.32,5.96,0,5.3,0.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.91,11.92,0,0,0,0,5.96,1.99,0,0,0,0,2.65,0,0,2.65,7.28,0,0,7.28,0,0,0.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.66,0.66,3.31,4.64,0.66,0.66,3.31,0,0,0,3.97,2.65,7.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.6,4.64,2.65,1.32,0,0,1.99,

For me, when it comes to working as a tester, most important is communication. How well you can communicate with team members, managers, team that develops the software you test.

Do they use some kind of bug tracking system, if so, what system is it? Is it the same system the development team uses? 

Does this tool cover most of communication needs, or there gonna be a lot of calls / email exchanging resulting in a total mess in discussions about issues?

Is there any automated tool used for testing? This gets you quite close to what are your responsibilities on this position, so will probably be covered in the interview anyway.

Do you get 2 monitors ;) ? (Really, getting a second display was like a huge improvement for me in tester job). Do you get the tools that make your work faster and more effective?Terms, definitions and tools are important thing... but analytical skills, logic, communication and other skills may be more important.

software threads vs hardware threads,"What is the difference between software threads, hardware threads and java threads? Are software threads, java threads and hardware threads independent or interdependent?
I am asking this because, I know Java threads are created inside a process with in jvm (java.exe). Also is it true that these different process are executed on different hardware threads?A ""hardware thread"" is a physical CPU or core. So, a 4 core CPU can genuinely support 4 hardware threads at once - the CPU really is doing 4 things at the same time.

One hardware thread can run many software threads. In modern operating systems, this is often done by time-slicing - each thread gets a few milliseconds to execute before the OS schedules another thread to run on that CPU. Since the OS switches back and forth between the threads quickly, it appears as if one CPU is doing more than one thing at once, but in reality, a core is still running only one hardware thread, which switches between many software threads.

Modern JVMs map java threads directly to the native threads provided by the OS, so there is no inherent overhead introduced by java threads vs native threads. As to hardware threads, the OS tries to map threads to cores, if there are sufficient cores. So, if you have a java program that starts 4 threads, and have 4 or more cores, there's a good chance your 4 threads will run truly in parallel on 4 separate cores, if the cores are idle.Software threads are threads of execution managed by the operating system.

Hardware threads are a feature of some processors that allow better utilisation of the processor under some circumstances.  They may be exposed to/by the operating system as appearing to be additional cores (""hyperthreading"").

In Java, the threads you create maintain the software thread abstraction, where the JVM is the ""operating system"".  Whether the JVM then maps Java threads to OS threads is the JVM's business (but it almost certainly does).  And then the OS will be using hardware threads if they are available.Hardware threads (e.g. Intel Hyperthreading) are a cheaper and slower alternative to having multiple-cores
Software threads are a software abstraction implemented by the (Linux) kernel:

either the kernel runs one software thread per CPU (or hyperthread)
or it fakes it with the scheduler by running a process for a bit, then a timer interrupt comes, then it switches to another process, and so on

Key to their implementation is the hardware provided and kernel configured separation between userland and kerneland: What are Ring 0 and Ring 3 in the context of operating systems?
I will now focus on hardware threads, which is the more obscure hardware question, with a focus on Intel's implementation which it calls Hyperthreading.
The Intel Manual Volume 3 System Programming Guide - 325384-056US September 2015 8.7 ""INTEL HYPER-THREADING TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE"" describes HT briefly. It contains the following diagram:

TODO it is slower by how much percent in average in real applications?
Hyperthreading is possible because modern single CPUs cores already execute multiple instructions at once with the instruction pipeline https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining
The instruction pipeline is a separation of functions inside of a single core to ensure that each part of the circuit is used at any given time: reading memory, decoding instructions, executing instructions, etc.
Hyperthreading separates functions further by using:

a single backend, which actually runs the instructions with its pipeline.
Dual core has two backends, which explains the greater cost and performance.

two front-ends, which take two streams of instructions and order them in a way to maximize pipelining usage of the single backend by avoiding hazards.
Dual core would also have 2 front-ends, one for each backend.
There are edge cases where instruction reordering produces no benefit, making hyperthreading useless. But it produces a significant improvement in average.


Two hyperthreads in a single core share further cache levels (TODO how many? L1?) than two different cores, which share only L3, see:

Multiple threads and CPU cache
How are cache memories shared in multicore Intel CPUs?

The interface that each hyperthread exposes to the operating system is similar to that of an actual core, and both can be controlled separately. Thus cat /proc/cpuinfo shows me 4 processors, even though I only have 2 cores with 2 hyperthreads each.
Operating systems can however take advantage of knowing which hyperthreads are on the same core to run multiple threads of a given program on a single core, which might improve cache usage.
This LinusTechTips video contains a light-hearted non-technical explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnS50lJicXcHardware threads can be thought of as the CPU cores, although each core can run multiple threads. Most of the CPUs mention how many threads can be run on each core (on linux, lscpu command gives this detail). These are the number of cores that can be used in parallel.

Software threads are abstraction to the hardware to make multi-processing possible. If you have multiple software threads but there are not multiple resources then these software threads are a way to run all tasks in parallel by allocating resources for limited time(or using some other strategy) so that it appears that all threads are running in parallel. These are managed by the operating system. Java thread is an abstraction at the JVM level.I think you are mistaken. I never heard about hardware threads (unless you mean hyper threading on certain intel machines). Every process is a running representation of a program. Threads are simultaneous execution flows with in a process. Java thread definitions are mapped to system threads by JVM. Java used to have a concept of GreenThreads, which is  no longer the case.",,,,,1,959,78.73,14.63,44.16,20.23,21.8,30.55,75.6,59.12,47.65,6.57,1.77,0.73,0,0.63,0,0.42,4.8,15.43,7.82,4.17,11.78,8.13,4.38,6.05,0.52,13.45,6.67,6.26,2.19,0.31,0.83,1.15,14.39,0.73,13.56,1.56,2.09,1.04,2.5,0.63,5.63,0.21,1.46,0.73,0.73,0.42,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0,3.65,2.71,0.21,0,0,0.21,1.36,0.94,0,0,0,0,4.28,0,0,4.28,3.65,0,0,3.44,0.31,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.31,0,0.1,0,0.21,0.21,0.21,2.4,8.34,0.42,1.77,5.74,0.52,0.1,0,2.92,1.56,6.88,0.52,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,16.27,5.01,4.07,0.94,0,0.31,5.94,

software update,"i want general idea about how to write the software update for an application? which technology is simple like VC++ or .Net?.. i just need the idea in brief.In general a software update is applied with an updater program. Otherwise running copies of the program make it hard to patch. 

Simplistically:


On every start of the program, connect to server with web service and download new install, if any.
Program calls updater.exe and exits. 
updater.exe applies patch, and restarts program.The following answer based on the assumption that you are refering to the auto-update for a software. Namely when launching your application you do a check to see if there is newer version available, and automatically download/install the new version if it is the case.

Microsoft ClickOnce is the simplest way if your application is .NET based. Here is a link that you can start with. It can be used with minimize effort.

An example of implementation from scratch using C++ can be found here. 

All these kind of ideas needs to solve the following problems:


Add mechanism in your software to uniquely identify the version informtaion.
Put the available (latest) software version information in some place that client can access (probably and HTTP server)
In your application you need to access to the public version information and compare with the client software version.
Implement the update functionality. That includes download the binary. Close the current application and run the installation. And then restart the application.


Note that for the step 4 it needs to close the running application and restart it after installation is done. This implies that you may have to do it in another process.",,,,,1,282,83.14,44.25,69.45,35.29,14.1,28.37,86.17,63.48,49.65,9.57,3.9,0.71,0,3.19,0,0,5.67,16.31,10.28,0.35,12.41,7.09,3.55,6.38,0,15.6,5.67,1.77,0.71,0,0.71,0,17.73,0.71,17.02,4.26,2.13,3.19,3.9,0,5.67,0,1.06,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.96,0.71,0,0,0,0,0.71,3.9,0,0,0,0,3.55,0,0,3.55,6.38,0,0,5.67,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.13,0.35,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0.35,4.61,8.51,0,2.13,5.32,0.35,0,0.71,6.03,1.06,6.03,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,15.6,9.22,1.42,0.71,0,0,4.26,
software update process,"I have made a small software in qt and its only one executable and a few dlls.I want somebody to help me understand how one goes about updating an exe and the dlls without having to replace the entire exe and the dlls but instead,write the changes you have made to an existing exe or dll.You can be interested in Courgette which is what Google uses for delivering small diffs to exe files.

Other linkYou can release a patch file that contains the differences between the user's existing version of the .exe and .dll files and the files that they now need to use.

Of course your build process still produces the full set of binaries1, but generating and distributing patch files means you have less to deploy.

It's not usual to do this, though, as it's more complex for the end user and (unless your distribution is vast) there's no highly tangible benefit.



Note 1 Why does this matter? What is the difference for you between:


Old file exists
Toolchain overwrites file with new information
New file now exists instead


and


Old file exists
Toolchain modifies only the changed bytes in the existing file
New file now exists instead


For any practical purposes I can't see how there'd be a benefit in the second.If you make changes to a particular DLL or EXE in the code, you have to recompile and rebuild the DLL or EXE and then overwrite your existing one.

Thanks : )U can use a centralized client-server based architecture..where the database and backend will be stored on server and u can access it using ur frontend thourgh a connection to server and its effect will be reflected in server which can be seen by all user!!If all communication is based on the SQL server (Stock, purchases, ...), then you don't need a direct connection between the two computers. It's enough if both can access the SQL server you mentioned!Since you need your software to work on network (in your case, two computers), the approach you need to follow is:


Host the database on a computer (database server) that is shared by all computers on the network. It can be with in a LAN or on the Internet (if you need so).
Modify the connectionstring in your application to connect to that database server.
Install the application on any number of computers that you want.


This will solve your issue.

Suppose, later you want to access the same database via website, you just need to create a website that connects with the database server and displays the records from the database.

stock exchange software,"Does anybody knows how several tens of display screens are refreshed each second in stock exchange buildings? Of course the server pushes the data to each screen, bud is this custom technology or some well known technology like example MSMQ ? Are there any study papers, books or something for the architecture of this kind of software ? RegardsI believe this is generally referred to as Messaging. From RabbitMQ:


  What is messaging? Messaging describes the sending and receiving of
  data (in the form of messages) between
  systems. Messages are exchanged
  between programs or applications,
  similar to the way people communicate
  by email but with guarantees on
  delivery, speed, security and the
  absence of spam.
  
  A messaging infrastructure (a.k.a.
  message-oriented middleware, a.k.a.
  enterprise service bus) makes it
  easier for developers to create
  complex applications by decoupling the
  individual program components. Rather
  than communicating directly, the
  messaging infrastructure facilitates
  the exchange of data between
  components. The components need know
  nothing about each other’s status,
  availability or implementation, which
  allows them to be distributed over
  heterogeneous platforms and turned off
  and on as required.
  
  In adopting this architecture, the
  developer is insulated from the
  details of the various operating
  systems and network interfaces
  involved and the interoperability,
  scalability and flexibility of the
  application are improved.
  
  Please see this presentation on Why
  you might need messaging for a general
  introduction or this page on Wikipedia
  for more information.


One popular paradigm for implementing messaging is publish/subscribe. Some implementations are implemented using point-to-point communication on TCP, some are using multicast on TCP/UDP.

For stock exchange displays, including other financial software that provides real-time prices, the prices are pushed to the clients rather than let them periodically request for the information (poll.) This is done to provide as near real-time prices as possible.It tends to be proprietory software, with all the information providers (Reuters, Bloomberg etc.) supplying their own client libraries  and/or applications. Most big banks (or at least the ones I've worked for) use Sun enterprise class servers, and Windows trading desk workstations.I believe they use custom protocol through TCP/IP. Each display is connected to internal LAN network and requests for information as needed.",,,,,1,367,93.61,29.49,9.52,31.47,17.48,37.33,78.2,59.4,46.32,5.72,1.91,0.54,0,0.27,0,1.09,3.81,14.17,7.36,0.54,16.62,5.45,2.18,6.81,0.27,13.9,4.09,4.63,2.45,0,0.82,1.63,14.71,0.54,14.17,2.72,2.18,0.82,4.09,0.82,3.81,0,0.82,0.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.35,7.08,0.27,1.09,0,0,3.54,2.45,0,0.27,0,0.27,1.63,0,0,1.63,7.08,0,0.27,5.72,1.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.09,0,0.54,0.27,0,0,0,0.27,0.27,1.91,5.45,0,0.82,3.27,1.36,0,0,0.54,1.91,5.72,0.27,0.54,0.54,0.54,0,0,17.98,6.27,4.63,1.09,0,0.54,5.45,

	Well, this is actully the solution and he had some file missing like error.php from public_html and some files from public_html/admin. After I did what you advised him to do, I updated the Invision Suite directly from Applications/System. When I pressed Update Now, I couldn't contiune without some files which. After that I downloaded again the Invisioncommunity Suite from client area and I replaced the files that are missing, I pressed contiune and everything worked perfectly.



	Not just that he's php version was running on 7.2 but I helped him change it to 8.0, after I changed it to PHP Version 8.0 the platform started working correctly.



	And I did something else aswell from ""Support"" there were some recomandations and some criticals error which could be solved only with a click.

	 



	Sorry if i miss spelled some words.

	Why?

	This new system is not good. While customers might be in a stressful situation we have to be careful not to disclose any information. For many of us, we must communicate in a foreign language.

	I've seen customers, by mistake, posting screendumps that includes member emailadresses and IP.

	Customers have begged their support-topic to be deleted.



	Myself I had to justify, in public,, why I didn't wont to post certain information.You would simply never post sensitive information unless its in an email ticket. This isnt really any different to any other public medium. If you have an issue whereby you need it to be private because there is private information, just ask and we can do that.

how can extract the software name from the $x variable ?Can you try this version? It's using your code, with Arco's fixes.

    $x.DisplayName | Out-File ""ListOf.txt"" -Append -Force
} 


The output I get is:

Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable (x64)
GIMP 2.8.14Thanks for your HElp,
i found the solution, in fact the $x variable for the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable  is an array, maybe because it is installed twice, the

Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\* | 
    select DisplayName, Publisher, InstallDate

return two lines containing the informations of  Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable.

	Click on the magnifying glass of the first row.nanWell, guessing: you probably don’t have the core_follow_count_cache.



	Wait for someone from IPS.This is due to your database is missing the core_follow_count_cache table. Please contact your hosting provider to see if they can investigate why it is missing on your server.


	While unrelated to your issue, I do want to bring up that you are rather behind in releases and should upgrade at your earliest convenience.There have been a few topics about missing the core_follow_count_cache table lately. 🤨On 9/2/2022 at 10:13 AM,   teraßyte said:

	This is very likely coincidental, given most are upgrading without issue, but I have brought this up internally for review in any case. Would rather check and be wrong 🙂



	The table itself being missing however, you would need to address in this case. The table will have existed prior to you starting the upgrade, so you would need to restore that table from a valid backup",,,,,1,340,67.46,89.5,14.76,37.12,26.15,16.18,76.18,62.65,49.12,10,6.47,0.88,1.18,4.12,0,0.29,3.53,11.76,5.88,4.71,14.12,10.29,5.88,3.82,0.59,20.59,4.12,3.53,3.53,2.65,0.59,0.29,8.82,0,8.82,1.47,0.29,2.35,3.24,0,1.47,0,2.35,1.76,0.59,0.29,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,12.35,5.29,2.35,1.76,0,0.29,1.76,7.65,0.29,0,0,0,0.88,0,0,0.88,1.18,0,0,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.59,0.29,0.59,0.59,0.29,0,0,0,0.29,4.12,10,0.59,1.18,6.47,1.76,0.59,0,3.24,2.65,5.88,0.59,0.59,0.59,0,0,0,25.59,6.76,4.12,0,0.59,0.59,13.53,
what is difference between Software Stack and OS ? why Android is not an OS but software stack?,"Android is a software stack but not an OS. as stated by developer.android.com What is Android? Android is a software stack for mobile devices that
  includes an operating system, middleware & key applications. The
  Android SDK provides the tools and APIs necessary to begin developing
  applications on the Android platform using the Java programming
  language. I don't understand that software stack is OS works with the Applications, so Windows is an OS but if I install Applications on it, should I call it a software stack? So what is the difference between Software Stack and OS, Android includes kernel so why not its an OS?The OS is the core kernel of the system, and the software stack is the software sitting on top of the kernel which enhances and expands the functionality of the system.

Windows tends to blur the line a bit, but Linux makes it a bit more visible.

In Linux, the kernel is the OS.  The software stack sitting on top of the kernel can include things like:


The X window system
The Gnome window manager
Applications for managing the system
And so on...


So things like a control panel application to edit system settings aren't part of the operating system.  They're part of the software stack on top of the operating system.

You could have a very tiny operating system which doesn't have much of a software stack running on top of it.  By itself, it wouldn't provide much usability, but rather a foundation for adding usability.

Android has its Software stack built upon Linux Kernel, which takes care of the power management acts as an interface between other hardware parts of the device.

what makes MSI to choose HKLM/SOFTWARE over HKLM/SOFTWARE/Wow6432Node,"The MSI package itself is in x64 but the registry key defined in the package(HKLM/SOFTWARE/[Key]) was written to Wow6432Node in a 64bit system. I'm using InstallShield as the tool. The registry key defined is like: ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\[software]"" The registry key defined is like: ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\[software]"" and I have a Process Monitor entry when the package was deploying: any ideas?You should say which tool you are using to build your MSI, and what your definition of the registry entry looks like, but the most obvious explanation is that the containing component is a 32-bit component. It should be marked as a 64-bit component to write to the native 64-bit registry. A 64-bit MSI can write to both 32- and 64-bit registry locations and file systems.",,,,,1,130,83.25,53.84,17.99,20.23,26,24.62,76.15,59.23,49.23,8.46,4.62,1.54,0,3.08,0,0,3.85,16.92,12.31,6.92,10.77,10.77,0.77,6.92,0,16.15,5.38,1.54,0,0,0,0,15.38,0,15.38,7.69,1.54,2.31,0.77,0.77,2.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.15,3.08,0,0,0,0,3.08,3.08,0,0,0,0,3.85,0,0,3.85,0.77,0,0,0.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.54,3.08,3.85,0,0,3.08,0.77,0,0,0.77,2.31,6.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.69,3.85,1.54,0.77,0,0.77,20.77,
which software can view any developed software code? [closed],"Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Stack Overflow. Closed 11 years ago. I would to know the software which can view code of Microsoft word software and any other software code. So that I can learn from that software code and how they used in there.
(sound's like illegal but really it is helpful for the programmer) any IdeasWhat you're describing is called a disassembler or decompiler.  It is rarely useful for what you want it for, because the intent of the programmer expressed in variable, method, and class names - is mostly lost.  This is somewhat less true for modern bytecode languages like Java and C#.You ask for a decompiler. Please note decompiling is illegal in many juridictions. Also once you decompile you usually get very hard to read assembly code learning from which is problematic unless you have plenty of experience and know exactly what you're looking for.You need to get a decompiler for viewing the code of dll and exe files based on the language its coded in. 

example:
Delphi Dll Decompiler

search for an appropriate decompiler te get the code back.",,,,,1,192,59.03,67.52,15.38,20.23,17.45,22.4,86.46,67.19,52.6,12.5,5.73,1.04,0,4.17,0,0.52,6.77,11.98,6.25,1.04,13.54,7.29,6.77,6.77,0,16.15,6.77,3.13,1.56,0,0.52,1.04,17.71,0,17.71,3.65,2.6,3.13,4.17,1.04,3.65,0,4.17,2.08,2.08,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.98,6.77,1.04,0.52,0,0.52,3.13,5.21,0,0,0,0,2.6,0,0,2.6,5.21,0,0,5.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,1.04,1.56,0,1.04,0,0,0,2.08,5.73,7.81,2.08,0,3.65,2.08,0.52,0.52,3.65,3.13,6.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.54,6.25,1.56,0.52,0,2.08,3.13,
wondering about Software Serial Library,"I was searching on the internet and i was seeing this Software Serial a lot, i'm wondering what the Software Serial library is used for?According to Docs:


  The SoftwareSerial library has been developed to allow serial
  communication on other digital pins of the Arduino, using software to
  replicate the functionality (hence the name ""SoftwareSerial""). It is
  possible to have multiple software serial ports with speeds up to
  115200 bps. A parameter enables inverted signaling for devices which
  require that protocol.


Suppose that you are using an Arduino Uno which has only one Hardware Serial port and you want to connect it to a GSM Modem which uses a serial port to communicate. And you need to get AT commands from a PC user. So you need two Serial ports. You can use Default Hardware Serial for PC communication and one Software Serial for communicating with the Modem. Then simply send and receive AT commands.

There are some limitations for Software Serial like slower baud rate comparing to hardware serial, can't receive data from multiple serials simultaneously, etc.

It is recommended to use Software Serial for boards that don't have enough Hardware Serial ports. So you need to remember that using Hardware Serial always is a better choice.",,,,,1,208,79.34,45.74,2.93,33.68,18.91,25.48,78.85,60.1,48.08,10.1,4.33,1.44,0,2.88,0,0,5.77,12.5,6.73,1.92,13.94,8.17,3.37,3.85,0.96,16.83,4.33,4.33,2.4,0,0.48,1.92,13.46,0.48,12.98,1.92,4.81,2.88,1.44,0.48,2.88,0.48,0.96,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.69,3.85,0,0,0,0,1.44,3.37,0,0,0,0,9.62,0,0,9.62,0.96,0,0,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.92,0.48,1.44,0.96,0.48,0,0,0,0.48,3.85,2.88,0.48,0.48,1.44,0.48,0,0,2.4,2.4,6.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.54,5.29,1.92,0.48,0,1.44,2.4,
